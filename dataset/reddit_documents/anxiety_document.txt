Title: What anxiety meds are good for an as needed basis.
Thread
I am going to the doctor in a few days and I do not want a medicine that I would have to take everyday like an sriconfusion. I have gathered a list so far of medicines to research lorazepam xanax probably cant go with xanax because it might react with my birth controlconfusion propranolol. I dont think I will go with this one because I dont want to risk the side effect of hair lossconfusion. If you have any experience with the ones above, please share, as well as if you have any other suggestions. I want it to be something that I can take in the moment before. Also, can you drive under these meds? It would be nice so I could take them before work

I was having anxiety issues and panic attacks for several years. Lorazepam was my go to medication. It sure helped, but I was never easy taking it because of its addictive potential. Then I found out about cod and gave it a try. It took me some time to figure out how to dose it now it is all I ever take, and it helps me a great deal. I do not know details about your condition, so this suggestion might be way off. Maybe consider it, though.

Does anyone feel that their anxiety has made them dumb? Like I cannot process my feelings. Sometimes I cannot really describe how I feel physically emotionally to myself or others. Sometimes, most of the timeconfusion, I lose my train of thought while speaking, and then I overthink what I just said. Also, I have an extremely horrible memory. I cannot remember what I did yesterday. My attention span is like a literal fish concentration is impossible too. I cannot focus on anything. Am I the only one

Meditation, positive thinking sports or any physical activity reading and classical music could help that just my little tip in the piggy bank. It was also, if not worse than yours now, much better. But it takes a long practice for the brain to get used to it going to be all right, you just need to make sure of it every morning. This is what my favorite psychotherapist taught me. I can only wish you luck. Don forget to smile happy face or smiley.

Nope, me, too. I say the most ridiculous things and cannot even carry a normal conversation sometimes. But there are both good and bad times. That is what keeps me going.

You have to. It is your animal mind, limbic system, getting into a fight or flight response inside your nervous system, hidden from public view, silent, yet violent. In that moment, panic, attack, anxiety, attackconfusion. You are an animal stuck in a cage of thorns, rattling the cage, trying to escape, but cannot because you cannot leave your body and cannot stop the uncomfortable fear and danger signals, which are firing due to a defect in your neurological circuits. So effectively, you are experiencing the same thing a deer experiences when being chased by a lion. You are trying to flee to save your life at all costs, and you have no time to see if the flowers are blooming or if the scent in the grass is nice or not. You just see the danger, and your limbic system is responding with pure terror and flight. The only problem is you cannot actually run away from where you are, or people would call you insane for running all the time. So this running and fighting happens inside your nervous system silently, but violently. This prevents you from doing anything productive. Because according to your brain and limbic system, you are supposed to focus all energies on fighting for your life, so you cannot focus on reading, writing, thinking, conversation, imagination, eating or anything at all, and other people around you will fail to understand why you are slow, stuck or performing poorly. There is a positive to this whole thing. It is that this isAlways temporary, and that fight or flight does not affect your genetic base level of abilities, intelligence or creativity. Due to this, once you learn how to handle anxiety, you will become suddenly more intelligent, resourceful, productive. Impressive, with your original personality, and people will notice I am saying this with confidence, because in the past years, I have been through the whole up and down cycle at least times over each time I lost a year or so of my life and career and then came back to rebuild it. I also have severe ocd and scrupulosity guilt disorderconfusion, apart from panic disorder. And while the incessant pulsing of ocd has not stopped as it is a fundamental neurological flaw I could recover, despite all this stacked against me. If I can do it. So can you? I am not really intelligent or gifted in any way just decent above average intelligence. So there is no reason you should not be able to recover, too. You only need to a find a good therapist. Take time to understand the disorder, which means reading books and watching videos and practically identifying inside your system, whatever is being talked about in the books and videos, keep applying the recovery techniques lifelong, I say lifelong, because even though it will take you only a few months to recover, there will be relapses. And so if you accept that you have to fundamentally change the way you handle your mind body system and live your life, you will bePrepared for all relapses to come upto recovery is common. Good luck.

Title: Anxiety cannot breath help.
Thread
Hello I am year old male for about years now I have had trouble breathing. I have had every test under the sun while at the start it was very scary. I find I can breathe better now compared to the start, but I notice it is starting to get more scary. I am convinced I am dying or have some sort of illness. I have been to the emergency and had many test. Also, with, go with every test you could imagine, it got to the point where they would ask me to just go home like I was wasting there time I did go through a trauma event. Someone did try and kill me and I was shot down in the street. The hit me in the leg. So it is not like I was shot in the lungs or anything like that. I am very open minded and understand that a trauma event could cause a pstd or anxiety episode, but no body is in my body. I read online, and it is like nobody is feeling how I am feeling. I am very motivated person and healthy. I do not understand. I have been gym for years of my life. I am always doing something physical. I just do not understand and seems no doctor can help. I just feel like I have pain in my chest. I get also wheezy from my nose like I feel like I cannot breathe through my nose. And if I try to breathe through myMouth I feel constricted with the amount of air. How can anxiety create wheezing with out some sort of asthma? I have had two lung function test, many ray and also it scan. Does anyone else have a explanation on why this would be happing? And if also, have they experienced this is this forever? Can this be beaten? Has anyone else felt wheezy from anxiety?

Title: This helped me to stop anxiety over others opinions of me.
Thread
My own self consciousness has limited me greatly in my life. I have held so much weight on others opinions. Recently, I began to question why we worry about others thoughts. After becoming interested in evolution, I started to wonder if it was a former survival adaptation. Before a era. I believe humans survival was based heavily on the people around them, tribes, communities, etc. If you acted differently or in a strange manner, you could be outed from your tribe and left to fend for yourself. So as a result, humans became very self aware about the way they behaved in todays modern environment. You will not be left for dead or killed if you act differently to others. In fact, to achieve success, you often have to think different, innovate and take risks. So for me, an effective way to overcome the fear of others thoughts is to recognise that it is simply an ancient adaptive trait for survival that is not applicable today. Although zero self awareness is dangerousconfusion. Whenever you walk into a supermarket bar or meet someone new and feel anxious, remind yourself you are feeling an ancient survival mechanism. You are no about to be killed or rejected from society.

Hi. So for the past year, I have had horribly anxiety absolutely horrendous. I am talking about.

Benzos like ativan are almost surely going to help you in the short run, the feeling is widely described as calming, but long term, it is a beast. So be careful pills is no problem, but many doctors dish them out like jelly beans. And when you are hooked, they calmly say to, wean yourself off really.

Just stick to the prescription and do not drink alcohol depending on your sensitivity, bodymass, etc. It can hit you differently, but honestly, it will not do much more than make you a bit groggy.

Took ativan in the past when I really struggled with panic attacks, take it only as prescribed and it does the trick quite well. I never felt high just kind of normal, I guess do. Man, you will be fine. Just take the pill acc to your docs instructions and enjoy the flight.

Preparing yourself for it will just stress you out even more and make it worst. This preparation your trying to do will bring you fear and make your body panic. Becouse your getting ready for a threat. In reality, it is not harmful or anything. For me, I just accept it and allow it. Chances are I will forget that I am hyperventilating, or it will stop. Becouse. I am not worrying at all about it if I really badly need to make it stop so I can focus more. I just start saying things like, yes, kill me! Make me collapse and it just stops. Becouse. I do not see it as a real threat, and I want it to happen

Title: Anxiety.

Okay. I have struggles with anxiety ever since I was or years old. I did not know much about it back then, and I have gotten more aware of it since I turned. I recently went to a psychiatrist, and he diagonal me with social anxiety and general anxiety and put me on meds. I have not been taking meds as I am, and my parents are not aware about the fact that I went to a psychiatrist. But I just have this doubt, like, usually, when I am in my room and working or studying, I start sweating, and like my hand, are shaky, like it happens so often that it almost feels normal now, but also I do not really feel anxious in that moment. So is there some other reason why it happens? Or is it because of anxiety?

I tend to sweat and get jittery after some social anxiety, but it could be anything. If you were given meds by a professional. Why not use them? Would your parents need to pick them up because you are or something?

Not sure if it is exactly the same. But I used to do the same thing to distract myself when I was thinking dark thoughts. And then later, it just sort of became habit took me a long while to stop picking it up, but I found the beat option was listening to the same lore videos so that it was just more of background chatter.

Title: I literally cannot function in society at this point.
Thread
Since the pandemic began years ago, I have defaulted to staying in my room most of the time and just play video games or watch netflix or youtube. I go for walks and go to the store sometimes, and that is fine, but I rarely ever socialize with anyone other than family. I tried to work at a restaurant. I had a severe anxiety attack and mood episode after just a trial shift and never went back. I enrolled for a college course and could not even go to the orientation. My mum dropped me off, but I literally just avoided campus and walked straight home. Now, I am not sure whether to contact someone or just withdraw. I know what may help the anxiety exercise, meditate, sleep better eat better, etc. But I am so apathetic disorganized and self destructive that I cannot even do, the things I know I need to do consistently. Do I need to take sari or ritalin again and fuck with my brain chemistry again? Just to barely do what other people do effortlessly do. I have to brute force, meditation daily and rigorous exercise hour every day and have a super strict sleep schedule and diet timing. I have tried for years, and I cannot make anything work. I honestly do not know if it is possible to fix myself and my life anymore, and I have almost given up what the point of living with mental illness or disability. I am literally the opposite of what society wantsThere is no place for me here.

Hi. I am not a medical professional, but I am diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. I have had anxiety whole my life, and I have been in the state of severe anxiety, similar to what you describe for about few months. And then the medications helped me. I see you are concerned about taking medications. As you say, do I need to take sari or ritalin again and fuck with my brain chemistry again just to barely do what other people do effortlessly. But antidepressants can help you. A drug named trintellix did wonders for my life. There are always risks with taking medication. It might take some time to find the medication that suits you, and there are sometimes side effects. But a medical professional will be guiding you every step of the way trintellix changed my life for a while. I wasnt functional at all. Now I have a job and can do a lot of things effortlessly, though, I am still more anxious than a regular person. But now my anxiety is manageable, and I can enjoy life. I am fully functional, not barely functional. Now, I think you should not fear meds and go ask for help. Milions of people around the world are on different types of medications to help them. You could also try some talk therapy like cut. But sometimes meds are needed before, so you can clear your mind and calm your emotions and do the psychotherapy right? And work on yourself. I will repeat. I am notA professional. And a first step for your wellbeing is to talk to someone who is. I just want to tell you that I ve been there, and there is a way out. Ask for professional help, best wishes to you. And there is a place for you in this world, just because you have a mental illness doesnt mean you are worthless. Our anxiety and other issues do not define us. We are so much more.

You re welcome. Here are some supplements that have helped me calmaid lavender pills to reduce your anxiety. You have to take it before a meal the first couple of times until your body gets used to it. Magnesium glycinate will also calm the nervous system. Hop is an amino acid that will increase the serotonin in your brain you cannot take while taking an sari. So it must be some what effective I am taking latrine and tryptophan together for my insomnia. Talk to your doctor about these supplements. Tryptophan is converted to melatonin during the day. When the sun goes down, your body starts to convert the melatonin to serotonin, which makes you sleepy. You release serotonin when you masturbate, so try to reduce it so you can build up your serotonin. Yoga and meditation help increase your serotonin. They also train your mind to be focused, clear of thoughts. And in the moment, you can lay in your bed foe fifteen minutes and listen to your breath saying in and out or one and two. When you breath in an out, the goal is to train your mind to not wonder and stay focused. Exercise is good, but do not over exercise, because it can actually increase your anxiety. I have read that riding your bike is really good for anxiety. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also really good for anxiety. It trains you not to catastrophizing

I ruminate about past events that hurt me. If I read a news article where an injustice occurred, then I will create a scenario in my mind where I dominate that person. I went through acceptance and commitment therapy, actconfusion, what it did is teach me how to train my mind, to react differently and to accept it. What you are trying to is run away from the fear in your head, and you cannot run away from yourself. It sounds like your getting anxious about what is happening, and that just makes it worse and reinforces it. What act does is it trains you to engage the logical part of your brain. So you are amygdala, where anxiety resides has less control. When I start reenacting something in my head, I will say to myself, I see your getting upset or your mind is going off on a tangent. I do not judge myself or get upset, which is also very important. You want to acknowledge it not react to it. Take a deep breath and let it pass it slowly chips away at the loop that your stuck in right now. You have to do it over and over again for it to work.

Title: Engulfed in angst.
Thread
This is quite long, but please, if someone can relate or has advice, I need help and do not know how to deal with this anymore. Amp I have been the odd one out all my life when there was a group of three walking down the street, it was always me strutting behind the other two, wanting dearly to be part of the conversation. But as soon as I was part of it, I felt immense pressure. I never know what to say. Years of trauma have hindered me engaging with the things I want to do. Instead, I spent a majority of my life engaging in escapism in the form of senseless youtube videos, which makes me a very boring person. I do not know a lot and have very little things in my life worth sharing. I am not my own individual person in conversations. I cannot just say what I want to say, but I always have to figure out what the best, most fun, most interesting, most thoughtful, most caring, etc. Possible answer could be. This makes conversations insanely stressful to the point where I am actively going out of my way to avoid them, they are physically exhausting. As my whole personality down to my facial expressions, is tending towards what I think my conversation partners needs are. My face feels contorted and sore. From all the fake expressions, my throat hurts from all the fake laughing. Every single expression comes from a place of panic instead of a placeOf authenticity. And the worst is, while I am having conversations, I feel so much panic that they might find out that I am faking it all. And while I might seem engaging and fun and a good listener, one day I can be very avoidant and distant, shy and unapproachable. The next day, this makes me very ambivalent and impossible to asses, which brings a lot of mistrust from other people. It gotten to the point where I am questioning. If I can feel authentic emotions other than avoidance, anxiety and distrustconfusion towards people at all anymore, which in turn makes it almost impossible to practice self love, because why would you love such a person? The love inside of me got lost, skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant. This is also the case in pretty much every relationship I have with friends or family, it like I cannot have authentic relationships with anyone anymore. Even driving in a car with someone sitting beside me is a major effort, and I get headaches. After a while, when I see other people laughing together and casually chatting with each other, I feel bitter and angry that this seems impossible for me, although I know that behind the bitterness and anger is a dear need for connection and togetherness. On top of it all, I suffer from depersonalization which often makes me feel like I am not even here at all and very zoned out. I cannot concentrate on what is being said to me, and amLeft in my head with questions like, why am I like this? What could I say? Fuck! I cannot concentrate. Fuck! I am in my head again. Why do I always think about these things? How can I get out of my head? Being fired rapidly at me? Even when I am by myself, I always have to think about these things, and it is very fatalistic, too. If I am like this, how can I possibly ever find friends, find work, build a life? It a vicious cycle? And I cannot see an exit. I am stuck in my thoughts pretty much all the time, and it is so hard to be optimistic and hopeful, it feels like there is panic and angst all around me, and I do not know how to get out of it, and am slowly losing the energy to bear up with it. Amp I know this is long and only ranting and complaining. I just hope there is someone out there that can relate, or maybe even has some advice or help in any way. Thank you very much.

Hey, mate, I want to, first of all congratulate you on your brilliant ability to communicate what is been going on for you.

Weed has always made me more awkward around people. I do still do it occasionally, but I like to be alone when I do. One thing you have to look forward to is your dreams are going to be crazy as hell. Some good, some scary marijuana suppresses your rem sleep. So your brain is going to make up for those years of not dreaming as much. Its trippy. And I like it lol as for everyday, and how you will feel you will be feeling good after the first week. You will miss it, sure, but its refreshing not being dependent on it to escape. I smoked for about years straight myself, and thats my experience. Good luck.

So when I first started smoking weed, I think it did help with my anxiety and insomnia. But when it became a daily habit it absolutely made me more anxious. But like I just kept doing it cuz I was anxious or bored to start anyway or I would just smoke more hoping to calm down and put myself to sleep. But instead I would just be tense and awake and ugh when quitting at first I hated lying awake sober like if I was going to have insomnia, at least I could be high. The big change for me was I found a partner I loved and lying awake next to them in bed listening to them breathe was actually pretty pleasant and I was not anxious about the fact that I was not sleeping or was not high or whatever. The last time I tried weed again, it was just immediately full body tension did not enjoy. Unfortunately, neither I nor a doctor can prescribe you a boyfriend or girlfriend. If it fits into your lifestyle, though you could consider a pet. Obviously, dog would be best, but don flip out on. Meconfusion rats actually make fabulous little companions. And if you bond with them young, they will hang out in bed with you while you try to sleep and they def play with you while you are sober.

For years of my life I was high becoming reliant on weed to help. Anxiety was so unhealthy and probably the biggest mistake of my life at some point in your life you are going to quit and not be able to deal with the anxiety if you continue to suppress it I truly thought that the euphoric feeling gave me confidence and made everything seem okay but I realized I just numbed all the emotions I was feeling. I do not remember much from those years my friends all told me that they were disappointed in my spiral and did not want to be around me when I was high now that I am months sober, I have a better understanding of what is actually happening to me and my body not to scare you or anything. But I developed panic disorder and agoraphobia after I quit, because everything that I did not feel for years finally caught up to me. I am still working on that stuff. But through all of this I learned that it is not worth it and I will probably never smoke again.

I used to smoke weed all the time, but eventually it started to have a negative impact on my mental health made me super anxious. And exasperated, some mental health issues I had developed. I ended up very reclusive for several years afterward. Quitting weed definitely helped to clear my mind up and make me feel a lot more productive, healthy and capable of experiencing life sober choosing to cut out certain things has really helped to reduce my anxiety in general weed, caffeine and alcoholconfusion. Even if I did not get anxious, when I smoked weed, I do not think I would smoke. It just turns me into a potato, and it makes me feel physically mentally grungy. And that does not feel good to me. I think if you quit, you see the benefits in time don give up or get down on yourself if it takes longer than expected to start feeling better, though

I have found that as my tolerance goes up and I need to have more to get high, it really causes me a lot of anxiety. I actually had a panic attack this past weekend because I was too high. You are not alone in this feeling, I promise.

I just started last summer, but yeah, I know the feeling depending on the strain. I can get really irritable, though. I tend to stick with strains that will make me more chill when I have found a good strain. I found that for the next couple days, my anxiety was reduced, but then I started doing it all the time. I tried to take a break, but only lasted about days because I had no appetite and could not sleep. My plan for when I need to cut back is to keep doing it, but switch more and more to cod as well as trying to take days off between getting high until I can go a week or two without it all take a long time. Probably the hardest part is that I work at a dispensary. I get to see all the new stuff and I get discounts on it. Customers want to know my experience with a strain. I am a little bit trapped, not going to lie

I smoke weed very casually only around other people who are more experienced with it I never had a problem with it honestly but I recently smoked like a week ago and the buzz I got from it felt very similar to the dizziness I get during anxiety attacks and so unsurprisingly I began to panic and thought I was dying because of the weed but I was able hold it in and started feeling better after a few minutes haven tried it again and I am afraid to because unlike just anxiety if I am intoxicated there is no way for me to get back to normal soberconfusion until it wears off so I might have to quit too

I think when you are constantly chilled out your body and brain forget how to cope with anxiety. So it is just relearning how to chill yourself out without the weed.

For me personally, I found that my anxiety was resulting in a response in my body that was akin to being high in that I was hyperaware of my surrounds, but somehow disassociated as well. When I first started smoking, it felt really good to embrace this feeling. But once I started working on my anxiety, I realised that I was just giving myself more opportunity to feel the way I did not want to feel. Maybe a better way to say this is I was only smoking to combat anxiety, whereas when sober, I did not want to embrace the feeling, but it was a bit more nuanced than thatconfusion. I took a break for a couple years, and now I might, on a very rare occasion, but my anxiety is definitely more under control. I know it can be difficult. You got this laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses.

I have smoked almost daily for a decade now recently had a severe panic attack when I got high and my he was sustained in the for long enough for me to get my of to take me to the hospital be. I was convinced I was dying even after that insult I was anxious for weeks for no reason when I have never had an issue with anxiety previously. Yes, marijuana can absolutely induce anxiety, panic disorders and tachycardia. I still smoke occasionally, but certainly not the amount of frequency I used to. I could not smoke at all for a long time after that. So yes, it is a positive thing to stop. Your brain will thank you. In so many ways I often feel like my short term memory would also be better had I not smoked so much for so long, it feels nice to be lucid and in control and comfortable just being in your own body.

I had the same thing where the anxiety just kept ramping up and I could not enjoy getting high anymore. Then I realized that I had not done any exercise in a loong time. I started doing cardio, at least a mile slow pace times a weekconfusion, and now I can enjoy weed like the old times. Tbe I would recommend regular exercise before resorting to medication if you have not tried it, go, try it. Now I heard a quote from an ex navy seal. I forgot his name, but it went something like I have not met anybody that was anxious. After doing burpees, I am still going to be cutting back tho, because moderation is what makes the highs high

This is my personal perspective on weetongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. It is a psychedelic. Therefore what it is going to do is amplify your psychological landscape so that you may become aware of the perceptual structures of your subconscious mind. This is one explanation as to why you have found your peace is easily disturbed. While high you might view this is as the medicine working, the way it is supposed to, because it is indeed a medicine. And the way it heals you is by helping you explore the way your mind is structured in doing so, you gain valuable insight into the belief systems that govern your perception which govern your emotions, which govern your behavior. All psychedelics do this in my opinion, and if you are not prepared to feel the emotions associated with the perceptions formed outside of your awareness and lurking in your subconscious mind, then you are going to have a bad time. I believe this is, at least, in part what we call a bad tripconfusion. Now, weed is a tricky beast, because in addition to bringing up emotions that may be difficult to digest, it also provides physical comfort and a fleeting hit of happiness by activating various happy neurological receptors. This makes it an excellent candidate for self soothing or escaping from otherwise overwhelming or uncomfortable states of consciousness. But the thing about using it to self soothe is that you are not actually getting at the root of the problem. AndThusly, you are only setting yourself up for a chemical dependency lest you feel uncomfortable being alive. The discomfort is due to the fact that you have emotions that you do not know how to feel because they have been pushed to the outskirts of your conscious awareness, and you have disconnected from the parts of your body that house the emotional energy at some point in your life. Most often in childhood, we may receive a message from people in our environment that suggest to us that feeling certain emotions can not be expressed or else you push people away. Your mind is designed to choose attachment to others over authenticity over time, this means that certain aspects of your individual nature get shut down, which takes energy to do this. Energy gets piled up and added to whenever you manage the emotions associated with this aspect of your nature, which, for example, might be the part of you that sets boundaries when someone disrespects you as you continue to live your life without resolving. This built up tension, it becomes extremely sensitive and uncomfortable. So we turn to addictions to help us manage the feelings of discomfort, both to help us escape the emotions, but also because to feel them would often be threatening to our self concept, which means that defensive maneuvers are automatically employed in order to keep you from being overwhelmed. All of this is to say that your anxiety is coming from unfelt, unacknowledged and dishonored emotions and unconscious identification.With wounded subpersonalities. Weed has helped you to temporarily alter your consciousness, but it has never resolved your need for escape. The solution then seems to be to resolve your need to escape in the first place. This can only be done by facing the parts of your psyche that have been deeply wounded. There are fragmented personalities living in your subconscious mind that have a story to tell and emotional energy to release that has been stagnated. The tricky part is that often times our ego or our sense of identity becomes informed and entangled with these wounded personalities. And so it becomes difficult to discern what is real and who we really are. Ultimately, once you start unraveling the tangled yarn ball of emotions, you will come to understand what belief systems lie at the root of these emotions. Once you have gotten that far, it becomes a matter of deciding whether or not these are beliefs you still want to hold, whether or not they align with your current values and knowledge about the world. This, of course, cannot be done until after you have processed the emotional energy. The best way I have to describe why this is the case is by pointing to the circumstance in which one is very angry. When this is the case, are they receptive. Will they listen to you? Surely not? They must expel the emotional energy before they can receive new information. It is no different when dealing with these subpersonalities which are independent constellations,Of emotions, beliefs, memories and behavior that live in your subconscious mind, I say live because they really are like living organisms. Living inside. You consider gestalt therapy as validation towards this claim. One method of engaging with this kind of therapy is by using the empty chair technique, which has you sit opposite an empty chair and ask a question to your self, which you then answer by switching seats and embodying the aspect of your psyche that has an answer to your question. This can be very effective in helping you to separate from the subpersonalities which may have become intertwined with your self conscious identity. This, of course, is only one example, but it makes the point clear your anxiety is coming from unfelt emotions, and what you need to do is learn to feel again. This process takes a lot of time, and you would best serve it by putting yourself in a safe and loving environment that is conducive to feeling and expressing vulnerable aspects of your psyche that often will not come out in front of others for fear of pushing them away and thus threatening your basic need of human connection. It is not easy to feel emotions that are behind such walls, but it is possible I can go more into my own techniques of doing so. And I can point you to some books that have helped me gain all of this understanding. Let me know how I can help you. Re not alone. I am yourBrother as I am a brother to all beings. Therefore I love you sincerely and I accept all parts of you.

I am in the process of quitting too well, I am tapering down somewhat slowly to mitigate potential withdrawal. I was smoking everyday, went down to a my edible for a few days, then a my edible a day for a few days. And now I am just taking a cod. No, the whatsoeverconfusion gummy for the next weekconfusion. Its rough, because for the past few years, I have smoked every day, and it is become a part of my nightly routine to unwind and feel happy. Ish. I thought it was helping my anxiety and depression, but I have learned long term use misuse can actually result in worsened anxiety, depression, anhedonia, etc. When you are not smoking from what I have read, it is out of your body after about days, but you will not feel the full cognitive effects until about a month after quitting. So as I return to whatever my natural baseline is, il be using some self guided journals and books the power of nowconfusion to work through the root of my anxiety and depression. I do recommend tapering down via cod gummies oil. If it is available for you. As I have found, it does help with withdrawal and cravings and does not have the psychological effects that the has. The self guided journals are kind of fun, too best of luck. Op you got this its daunting at first, but with a little self care, love, you can do it. Youre not alone. Happy, face or smiley

The last part about getting annoyed when someone disturbs your peace I can relate to. I enjoy my routines even when I am sober. But when high, I do think it gets harder to deviate from them. I am a pretty high strung, irritable person anyway. But when high, I think I am less able to deal with those irritable feelings. Maybe it is time for me to cut back too. Anyways. I hope you are feeling better soon.

My experience was not so much that weed degraded my mental health directly but it did alter my behaviors and over time that affected my mental health. I smoked almost daily for a few years to ease anxiety and depression. It would make me happy and content in the moment and I learned how it feels to be content with life and myself from that time but it also prevented me from feeling motivated to do the things that I really wanted needed to do to improve myself and my life in a lot of ways I would always be disappointed that I was not growing as a person. Moderation and balance can be a hard thing to achieve, but it is so important to work toward smoking was an easy escape. But ultimately I was stuck. I eased myself off when I quit a job I hated a couple of years ago and then started a new job. And my husband and I started talking about having a family currently pregnant and sober husband still uses marijuana daily. But he and I are different, and he has a good head about it all. He will ease up as we are closer to our due date. I look forward to striving toward more balance in my life. Learning to be content and working to be better at the same time, obviously, having kids will change everything, and neither of us will be leading the lives we did in our twenties. But maybe rewarding myself with aNight of smoking, drinking, if I accomplish a goal, go for a run, do yoga, etcconfusion, and limit it to weekends, or a certain number of times a week.

My of recently did this too for a number of reasons. He been smoking daily for almost years and it was starting to negatively impact things like his appetite, sleeping schedule and even his libido he also finds that when he gets baked, he has issues with his lymph nodes which after a bit of googling we have found to be an almost common issue with people. I also quit smoking daily. I basically told him that we should stop smoking at home and only really bust it out if we are at a friend house or a gathering after dinner so that the appetite, weird sleeping and lack of sexual desire will not really matter. He been having weird dreams lately, though, which is also apparently something that can happen, but otherwise he seems rather content with his sobriety methinks, you should find some other kind of coping mechanism. I have started using a little tip I found somewhere on reddit that is been helping me when I get randomly paranoid and anxious, say out loud things. You can see things you can hear moving parts of your body and move them. As you say itconfusion, I find it helps bring me back to reality and stops me from focusing on the anxious feeling that overwhelms me sometimes

So I did not start smoking weed until the pandemic hit and that is only because it was legalized here michiganconfusion around that time I was and am in a really great spot in my life and when I started smoking it seemed to make things even better funner goofier but over the last year or so I have developed a serious health anxiety and have had two panic attacks post smoking I do not know how to rank them but I was in heart pumping freak out mode for minutes both timesconfusion I used to use weed to enhance my day but I honestly cannot say I use it for just that anymore times I smoke it is still fun and no issues but I am starting to get anxious about smoking because it might make me anxious lol your point about getting angry or frustrated when really high happened to me yesterday for the first time and culminated with an attack last night im starting to think that the state of mind I am in before smoking has a big effect on me thanks for posting this op edit I also drank caffeine in the late afternoon which I rarely doconfusion and I think that also had an effect

Weed has always made me more awkward around people. I do still do it occasionally, but I like to be alone when I do. One thing you have to look forward to is your dreams are going to be crazy as hell. Some good, some scary marijuana suppresses your rem sleep. So your brain is going to make up for those years of not dreaming as much. Its trippy. And I like it lol as for everyday, and how you will feel you will be feeling good after the first week. You will miss it, sure, but its refreshing not being dependent on it to escape. I smoked for about years straight myself, and thats my experience. Good luck.

Title: I am anxious and scared that I did not create a safe sexual environment.
Thread
I really need advice I have been unable to sleep I have been obsessing about every single aspect every day hey I am a recently got into a massive and frightening situation and it has been affecting me because I could never imagine I would make anyone feel unsafe in a sexual dynamic with me recently a friend of mine lan a woman and this is not their real nameconfusion sent me a message saying that they overdosed on pills and were taken to the er in panic I called and they did not answer so the following day I called their partner fanny a woman and this is not their real nameconfusion to ask questions on what is going on fanny stated that lan has been in the er times during the weekend and that lan has been threatening to kill herself is fanny breaks up with her it has gotten to the point that sometimes when they would be together lan will attempt to jump out the window and fanny had to restrain her I told fanny that she should do what is best for her and take space if she needs to for this is a traumatising and frightening experience I later call lan that night and she is in tears saying that no one loves her and she is in the er and I affirm her by saying you are loved yes fanny needs some time to heal but you are loved I tell her that I will visit her in theHospital the next day the next day comes and I get a text from her saying that she wants to leave the er and she told the doctors that she will be staying with me for the next week so that she can leave. I am not as comfortable with the idea, but I still come to see her before leaving the hospital with her. I tell the doctors that I will be unable to host her because my apartment is so small, but I will be checking up on her for hours everyday because we do not live that far. She is weak and tired, so we go to eat, she eats and we talk and she looks refreshed. I ask what happened? And she mentions that she overdosed on pills when going to fanny house. I ask her when she will attempt infront of fanny house, and she mentions that she wanted to get something from her. I find that abit, twisted but move on and affirm all her feelings. She mentions to me that fanny broke up with her and blocked her everywhere and that she feels so alone and she is thankful. I am here, we continue talking and then I walk her to her house, stay with her and continue talking. She looks better and happier that I am with her mind you I have always had a crush on her and although fanny was my first friend, I have always entertained the idea of me being with lan so asMe an lan talk I feel a strong desire to keep it simple. Stupid her. My first keep it simple, stupid with a woman because she was looking beautiful and I ask if I can keep it simple. Stupid her. And she says nothing for. She thought I was joking. I said, I a bit of a slut and I kind of want to keep it simple. Stupid you! She looked flattered. And then I ask again on a more serious note and she pecks me. We continue talking and I ask if I can keep it simple, stupid her properly. And then we kiss it was nice and I kissed her eyes. We continue talking and I think everything is fine and is okay. She looks happy, looks present. And then I ask for permission again, and then we make out she looks at me with desire and is moaning. And its not as mind changing for me, because this is my first time we stop, and I am met with shock because all my internalised homophobia jumps. And I am shocked that I kissed a girl. And I panic that this same girl just left the er. We stop and I tell her that I have to go now because it is late and I wear my shoes and tell her that I will see her the next day and that I am sorry for brining that sexual dynamic. I ask her again as I leave. If she is okay and whatnot? I askIf she is okay with us kissing and she said she was fine and that she is okay and we are laughing as I leave cus of another convo and we hug goodbye and I tell her that I will see her the next day as I leave I am met with deep shame because it feels like I took advantage of her or rather I took advantage of her and I was met with shame for I also kissed a girl. My fear and shame was rising I was panicking until I got home called a friend and the friend said that it was problematic that we kissed and I asked to keep it simple stupid her while she just left a very fragile state in the er. But she mentions that as long as I do not entertain this dynamic and I set boundaries that it will not happen again. And I did do that before I left land place. I call lan again just to apologise for initiating that sexual dynamic, and she says that it is okay and that if she wanted to stop, she would have said, no, I still apologise. She then asks me to call fanny to know how she is doing and then inform her. I tell her that I am not as comfortable with that, considering the fact that she is emotionally manipulating and abusing fanny with suicide, but that I will see if I can call I then call fanny three hours later and ask fannyIf she broke up and blocked lan and fanny says that she would never that how could she then fanny informs me that lan was taken to the er again because she was screaming and trying to jump out of her story window. And her neighbours called the er for an emergency. I was in shock because when we called, she seemed fine and was better. When I was with her in her house, I was filled with shame and guilt, and I told fanny that I initiated a sexual dynamic and we kissed, and I apologised that was so wrong of me because she just came out of the er and I did not know the gravity of the situation. I try calling lan to see how she is doing. And then fanny texts me that she is so mad that I pretended to be freinds with them and that I took advantage for my own sexual desire. I am met with deep shame and regret I never intended or planned to do this. Fanny then informs me to never reach out. That lan does not want to speak to me for before. When told she was in the er, I mentioned that I will not be able to visit her, because she might use me visiting to leave the er agian, and that lan felt guilty and just followed, along with the sexual dynamic, and that I really triggered her, and that is what caused her to go to the er agian. I haveBeen filled with so much shame in the last few days I never imagined that I will hurt anyone like this. I feel like a horrible person and I do not know what to think. I spoke to a few friends and family and some have mentioned that I did nothing wrong, that yes, the situation was questionable, but I asked for consent and received it. They even add that lan may be abit twisted for she lied about their break up with fanny. Others say that the situation was also problematic and I was wrong. I do not know how to feel. I just feel like a creep that took advantage of someone who was not in their normal mind, but I never had an idea of the gravity of the situation. I realised that me even getting her from the er was just to gratify my own ego. And the reality is that how can someone consent when they were in a mentally fragile state and I am going back and from I took advantage of someone who was weak and then to when I was kissing her I just wanted to have a cute movie first time keep it simple? Stupid. With a woman I am perplexed I do not know what to think and I am ashamed of my myself that I hurst someone so deeply. So my questions are does this count as sexual assult? How does someone heal from realising that they can be this violent to a person? DoesThis define me? Am I a creep and a horrible person now do you perceive this situation as horrifyingly selfish and horrible? Have you ever found yourself in this kind of place? I also apologise for how self centered my post is I am not even centering the victim, but I just wanted to like word vomit, everything in my head.

Of the situation sounds really messed up. I know brains can slide a lot under such stress, especially if sexual desire is involved. Probably not the best idea to keep it simple, stupid, a suicidal friend just out of a relationship with another friend. But well, we all make mistakes, and it does not sound like your action is at the core of all the mess, even if it added to it, I think it is quite brave and mature that you communicated about it and that you assume responsibility and regret it. While understanding the problematic one mistake does not define you as long as you learn from it that what I want to think hope you and your friends will be ok

Title: I feel like I cannot exist without any form of anxiety. Do you know that feeling too?
Thread
Like I have been in therapy for roughly month, and I am happy that I am slowly making progress in defeating my social anxiety. When my therapist and I went through the diagnosis progress, we briefly talked about the fact that I show symptoms signs of a generalized anxiety disorder, too, as it had not been the major issue I have been struggling with. I wanted to fully focus on learning how to cope with my social anxiety. However, as I am making progress, I am starting to realize that now I spent a lot of time and energy throughout the day worrying about almost anything, particularly health problems. I am hesitant whatsoever to talk to her about it, because she might think I am weird and or attention seeking, or that she thinks I am not working hard enough, isn satisfied with the results of her work here speaks my saconfusion. I am now deeply afraid that my mind just cannot exist without anxious, repetitive thoughts of any kind, and this nightmare will keep me imprisoned my whole life. Have you experienced something like this too? How did you deal with
Comments
When I was first diagnosed, something that helped me tremendously was my psychiatrist saying that the end goal is not eliminating anxiety, but getting it to a livable level. I was an anxious child, and I remain an anxious adult, but when I have a handle on things, it is a low buzz in the background, not the main focus of my life. I will always be a person with anxiety, but I can be happy and functioning too. Also, I would like to add, though I know it is hard to believe with saconfusion that your therapist will not think badly of you. If you tell her any of this that what she wants to hear, your feedback helps her do what is best for you.

Title: To mention of suicide reassurance. Amp help needed.
Thread
Hello, guys, I am just looking for some reassurance. This is my story. I am a female and have a loving husband as well as beautiful dogs. Unfortunately, I have a long history of miscarriages and stillborn in. I learned to deal with it and was able to manage my anxiety without medication and therapy. Of course, it was very difficult and a horrible time, but luckily, I have seen a fertility specialist and he found the reason as to why this has happened. I had a weird septum which has now been removed and am currently on my first official cycle to try again, which I want to hold off on until I am able to control myself a little better. In may, we found out that our daughter had passed away in my womb at months and I gave birth a week later in early june. At that time, couid precautions were pretty strict here in australia, and unfortunately, my husband was told there was no work for him labourerconfusion. He was always very proud and happy to work fast forward to the of august. He gave me a keep it simple, stupid told me he loved me and went out to the shed for a cigarette. He started smoking after we had our daughter. I was just finishing dinner and was about mins until I went into the shed to get him for dinner. It was dark, and he did not answer me. I noticed he was standing next to me, so iShook him and asked why he is not answering that when I realised his pants were wet. So I decided to turn on my flashlight on the phone and to my horror he was not standing he had hung himself in a panic I held him on my shoulders, thinking I would help him then I screamed for help while trying to ring our neighbour who did not pick up. Then all of sudden something switched, and I just thought, what the am I doing call an ambulance? Which I did and all I remember was the lady telling me to cut him down and start doing car, which I did. And eventually the police arrived and took over the rest of the night is really blurry. Luckily, he is made a full recovery and cannot remember anything from that day. Unfortunately for me. I do that when I started seeking therapy while I have learned to live with the memory, it still haunts me to this day, and I am just so glad I found him in time. There were no signs of something like this happening fast forward to the it of jan at am I tried to ring my uncle to wish him a happy new year. As I live in a different country from my family grew up with his mom, my oma. So we are all really more like siblingsconfusion, but he did not pick up, thought nothing of it and figured he is just celebrating. Little did I know iWould get a call about hours after from my other uncle to let me know he would passed away from heart failure that was the last straw for me I got sick and from that I developed what I thought was costochondritis, which actually is tietze syndrome after having an updated chest it scan done ever since he died my anxiety has reached its peak for over a year. I have been struggling so much I do not know if it is possible, but I think his death has caused me to develop health anxiety. I have lost my job as a store manager of years because I just cannot function. I am constantly dizzy. I feel like I am passing out and scared that I die from a heart attack. I have been obsessively taking. My blood pressure had an echo done several other imaging tests, and everything came back, clear, except for my swelling in the chest. On the ribs. I do have sinus tachycardia, which I believe to be from anxiety. I also had a complete thyearoidectomy because of some growths on the thyearoid. I developed hashimoto, but that was all way before all of the above things happened and never ever was I this worried about my health. I keep having this impending doom feeling constantly so much so that I have no interest in meeting our friends or anything like that. I started taking zoloft, my yesterday, and I am hoping things will improve soon. I am also still seeing myTherapist on a regular basis and trying to meditate as often as I can. I guess I just want to know if things will get better. Will I ever be my old happy, live, loving self again? If you have made it this far, thank you so much for reading my story, I would appreciate any sort of input. English is not my first language, so I apologise in advance for any grammar mistakes.

I do not really know what to say, seeing what you have cannot be east, and then being asked to live with it as if it were nothing is even worse. Going through so much makes people think that it automatically makes you stronger, so smaller problems should not hurt that bad or mean that much. But that is not a fair or realistic assumption to have. When people say they have grown numb to the pain, I do not think it means that they cannot feel pain anymore. I think it just means that there simply is not enough energy in them anymore to display their actual emotion. I struggle with anxiety as well. I used to think it was just health, but as time goes on, it becomes more clear that I just have anxiety over everything. I am a bit better at controlling it by taking medicine and being able to somewhat talk myself out of it, but it still affects me a lot. I do not know if it will get better. I cannot really say I wish I could, because that would mean it would get better for me too. But I think the only way to get better is just to confide in someone and hold the person you love a lot. They are looking for the same answers, and you could help one another find them

My daughter confusion, has had anxiety off and on her whole life she did really well with it for the past years or so but for some reason as of late, its not going well. She has had some life changes with friends and also prepping for college but she keeps saying she feels like shes gagging or her throat feels tight has also extremally worried around. Anyone who gets a stomach bug has always had a fear of puking long and short shes avoiding school every morning she wakes up crying, saying she does not want to go. We usually calm her down and then she goes, I will get prob text messages through out the day telling me various reasons she wants to come home, but she thoughts it out. I hate seeing her like this, and we got her in with a therapist starting yesterday, but I was wondering if anyone else knows anything else they can do

She probably has emetophobia. I have it too. It makes things hard. I remember I did not want to go to school or travel because I was petrified of getting sick and not being able to escape. Its a control thing for me with this phobia, its really tough sometimes.

It seems like your daughter is experiencing panic attacks with the tightness of the throat feeling. A lot of physical symptoms can happen with anxiety, and people think something medical is wrong with them. So it causes a lot of worry. Therapy can really be helpful in this if she has someone to reassure her that they will be okay. Another alternative would be medication such as saris, that people take long term with little to no side effects. For some, they are serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and for the most part, take the anxiety away completely by producing more of a natural body chemical that calms people down. The good news is that anxiety is very manageable with a lot of different options. Hopefully, the therapy helps, and I hope the best for you guys

I know the likelihood of a full scale world war or nuclear armageddon is slim, but the fact there is even a chance and we are only a few dominos falling in a particular order from it right now has me terrified and shaking constantly. My family and friends keep telling me to avoid the news and places like worldnews, but I feel unable to bury my head in the sand, knowing these things will carry on happening, whether I am reading about it or not. And I fear what il miss. If I stop today, reading about putin personally overseeing massive military drills and assessing how ready their nuclear weapons are has sent my anxiety to new heights again.

Even if it happened, your life probably would not change. Theres no use worrying about it. I live closer to ukraine but not close enough to be concerned. This conflict has been going on for years. Its just the media attention that is making you panic quit watching the news for the time being I have struggled with anxiety over this for years and when I stopped watching the news, it got so much better.

Russia is threatening to attack one country they do not want to start a global nuclear war and even if they did worrying about it is not going to change the outcome it a delicate balance with anxiety because ruminating and googling things tends to make you feel worse but so does trying to block out your fears by ignoring them how about giving yourself a fixed time each day to worry about armageddon and outside of that time try not to think about it and ban yourself from googling

No shame in taking medication if it is necessary and feeling the way you do all the time is unnecessary. I, too struggle with physical symptoms attributed to my anxiety and with both therapy and medication have managed. Alright, it is exhausting to feel like that. All of the time totally understand you are not alone.

I am not a doctor or anything, but it seems like you may have an ocd and anxiety combo. If you are having unwanted, consecutive thoughts about things that trigger your anxiety, it could be the case. I have also suffered from derealization since I was im nowconfusion, and it can be really tough. You should get in contact with a psychiatrist about starting a medication plan, but also, something that can really improve your situation is talking to a therapist. If you have time or a family member about this, you should not have to go through this alone. Just know that it is just anxiety. And even though you feel like something is wrong physically, it is just your mind going bezerk cause of the adrenaline, youre going to be fine. I hope you feel better soon. Friend,

Title: I wish I could be normal for my dad.

I have the most amazing dad and we used to do so much together like road trips all through europe and such things but ever things this goddamn anxiety started I panic over everything we cannot do anything anymore because I am so paralyzed and crippled by this all consuming anxiety he still wants to go on big road trips with me as we used to and I always have to decline and every time I do it breaks his heart he just want to have some quality time with his daughter but I am too broken I hate myself so fucking much so fucking goddamn much I hate what I have become
Comments
He your dad, he loves you. Let him know how you feel if you have not already actively work to treat your anxiety, to bond and spend time, it does not necessarily have to be a huge trip. Cook him dinner one night, have him take you fishing, show interest in his hobbies, and I am sure he will reciprocate. Don beat yourself up about not being up for a big road trip like that. Personally, a trip like that would stress me out. And if it was just me and my dad in the car together for that long, it would stress the both of us out. Lol

I have had a tough past. I do not want to get in the details of this, but I am already on this beautiful journey of making things better and gaining my confidence. I have two friends, but we do not meet often, and I am overly dependent on them. Emotionally, I want to branch out and make new friends, but I do not know how to go about. I have lost two close best friends last year when I decided to stood up for myself. So it is difficult for me to trust anyone and make new friends. But I do want to do that. How do I do that?

The best way to do that is to go out more and have a bigger social life, go to bars or restaurants on the weekends or try getting involved in community programs like feeding the homeless or volunteer work. The only way you are going to meet people is by putting yourself out there and being put in new situations where there is new people. I am also in the same boat as you kind of, so I can understand a lot. Also, discord is a really good place to be involved and meet cool people. You can video chat with and maybe meet up with them

Firstly, happy birthday birthdays always bring about a lot of anxiety and depression for me I know how you feel it was my it a couple of weeks ago, and I did not have anybody to celebrate with and all of the bars were closed anyways from the snow. I know you must be feeling like you have been suffering for a long time, but is barely the beginning of your life not even an adult yet you have all of the time in the world, and in that time you will learn and grow and it will get easier things are still hard for me and I still have a lot of room to grow. But gosh, am I so much happier than I was when I was? I could not even leave the house for months at that age because of how crippling my anxiety was in a few years? I bet you will look back and think the same. Try not to put so much pressure on yourself to have fun or feel a certain way because it is your birthday. Its totally normal for your birthday to send you spiraling reminds you of your own mortality a little, especially as your childhood comes to an end. I am sorry you feel like this today but do not give up yet not too late to turn the day around and if you dont fuck it and celebrate another day

Title: To mention of suicide reassurance. Amp help needed.

Hello, guys, I am just looking for some reassurance. This is my story. I am a female and have a loving husband as well as beautiful dogs. Unfortunately, I have a long history of miscarriages and stillborn in. I learned to deal with it and was able to manage my anxiety without medication and therapy. Of course, it was very difficult and a horrible time, but luckily, I have seen a fertility specialist and he found the reason as to why this has happened. I had a weird septum which has now been removed and am currently on my first official cycle to try again, which I want to hold off on until I am able to control myself a little better. In may, we found out that our daughter had passed away in my womb at months and I gave birth a week later in early june. At that time, couid precautions were pretty strict here in australia, and unfortunately, my husband was told there was no work for him labourerconfusion. He was always very proud and happy to work fast forward to the of august. He gave me a keep it simple, stupid told me he loved me and went out to the shed for a cigarette. He started smoking after we had our daughter. I was just finishing dinner and was about mins until I went into the shed to get him for dinner. It was dark, and he did not answer me. I noticed he was standing next to me, so iShook him and asked why he is not answering that when I realised his pants were wet. So I decided to turn on my flashlight on the phone and to my horror he was not standing he had hung himself in a panic I held him on my shoulders, thinking I would help him then I screamed for help while trying to ring our neighbour who did not pick up. Then all of sudden something switched, and I just thought, what the am I doing call an ambulance? Which I did and all I remember was the lady telling me to cut him down and start doing car, which I did. And eventually the police arrived and took over the rest of the night is really blurry. Luckily, he is made a full recovery and cannot remember anything from that day. Unfortunately for me. I do that when I started seeking therapy while I have learned to live with the memory, it still haunts me to this day, and I am just so glad I found him in time. There were no signs of something like this happening fast forward to the it of jan at am I tried to ring my uncle to wish him a happy new year. As I live in a different country from my family grew up with his mom, my oma.

I have been struggling so much I do not know if it is possible, but I think his death has caused me to develop health anxiety. I have lost my job as a store manager of years because I just cannot function. I am constantly dizzy. I feel like I am passing out and scared that I die from a heart attack.

Title: Anxiety keeps me up and sick.
Thread
So I always thought anxiety was not really a thing until I have been experiencing it myself. Does any one of you have anxiety attacks that last through the night and unable you to sleep? I have had it a handful of times. Now, since the pandemic started, I tried breathing techniques, positive thoughts, and still, my heart beats like I am running a marathon. It keeps me awake at night and unable to feel physically fit during the day. Sometimes my knees are weak. I feel feverish or nauseous. It can last one night or more. I really hope I am not alone in this thinking of seeking help, but not sure if my doctor can do anything for me.
Comments
I had this the worst in my heart raced continuously, and I could not switch off many hours of lying awake in bed. The only thing that helped me was to listen to podcasts. I would be concentrating on the person, voice and the story being told. Rather than thinking about trying to sleep, I am still suffering from insomnia now, but the podcasts did help a lot. Also do not watch the news. It is bad for you. I hope you find a way to switch off and sleep soon. Smiling, face with smiling eyes.

Title: Got offered a new job this morning and started crying.
Thread
So finally, after working in a really toxic workplace environment for years, I got offered a new job. As soon as the woman on the phone offered me the job, I started crying and she asked me what the matter? I told her I was feeling really overwhelmed, scared due to change really scares me. But I know deep down, this is what I need. I need a change. I need to move on. I need something different, and this will be good for me. I felt so embarrassed crying on the phone, and my brain was telling me, why are you crying? Stop crying, because you will make a bad impression. She must be thinking, why the hell is this girl crying? She was actually quite understanding and told me to give her a call back when I am a bit more calm anyway, I accepted the job offer, and I am so happy I am finally leaving a workplace that has affected my mental health so much

Title: I feel like I cannot exist without any form of anxiety. Do you know that feeling too?

Like I have been in therapy for roughly month, and I am happy that I am slowly making progress in defeating my social anxiety. When my therapist and I went through the diagnosis progress, we briefly talked about the fact that I show symptoms signs of a generalized anxiety disorder, too, as it had not been the major issue I have been struggling with. I wanted to fully focus on learning how to cope with my social anxiety. However, as I am making progress, I am starting to realize that now I spent a lot of time and energy throughout the day worrying about almost anything, particularly health problems. I am hesitant whatsoever to talk to her about it, because she might think I am weird and or attention seeking, or that she thinks I am not working hard enough, isn satisfied with the results of her work here speaks my saconfusion. I am now deeply afraid that my mind just cannot exist without anxious, repetitive thoughts of any kind, and this nightmare will keep me imprisoned my whole life.

Comments
I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, and am also in therapy. All the things you mention here sound very familiar, specifically the health, anxiety and imposter syndrome, about not trying hard enough to get better. Being an attention seeker, all of these things are typical for a person with moderate to severe anxiety to experience and being anxious about anxiety itself and never getting better, especially if the illness is more prominent at times, is also common. Nevertheless, all of these symptoms are distressing and need to be addressed. Have you talked to your go? Or psychologist, if you should be referred to a psychiatrist to maybe get you on medication? There is antidepressants that have been proven to help anxiety, even in small doses. And with healthcare professionals watching over the process, you can safely implement them into your life. If that is something they think makes sense for you. And even if not, therapy is a process, and it is, sadly, not as quick as we would like it to be. But since you are already seeing improvements in your social anxiety, once you start addressing the other issues, even if it is scary to bring them upconfusion, you will see them there, too. I understand you very well and hope you can stay strong and get better, wishing you the best happy face or smiley

I think that is definitely normal and also kind of the premise of anxiety feeling like things are permanent and that makes us feel trapped. But I think we can look at the bigger picture here. You are learning to cope with and form new perspectives about your social anxiety. So why cannot that possibility exist for your anxiety overall? I do not think it is an all or nothing thing when it comes to mental health, but you are doing the right thing by getting help and talking about it also, it is not attention seeking to mention your feelings of gad and health anxiety. The therapist is there to help you so whether or not they think that which they dontconfusion is irrelevant. Youre ok, deep breaths and big hugs.

I deal the same thing cant even calm the mind at night. This is dumb, but I pile so many pillows on top of me and around me, I think like it is my cheap diy for a gravity blanket.

Try eating earlier before and exercising more it will help your body to produce serotonin and will naturally make you sleepy around bed time also avoid sugar food drinks around those hours and try listening to audio books or even the news if you have a solid sleep schedule it can make a huge difference also

Thread
Hi, everyone doobutt jones here. Quick question does anyone have advice on waking up sweaty and wet palms during the day? Ink if there are vitamins or crimes that can help but I am sick of being a greaseball because of anxiety. Any advice thank you and keep your head up thumbs.
Comments
Hi so against waking up sweaty I can only recommend you to shower in the morning and use a shower gel with teatree or lemon in it. I have the ones from the body shop you just feel super fresh after showering with it but its just important you finde one that gets all the sweet and dirt away without giving the skin stuff to great fast and so that you have a fresh start in the day as of does. I can only recommend vichy. They also have a line called stress resist. But if you ask at the pharmacy they will point you to the right one, because vichy has a few keep in mind to put, does only on when you get out of the shower. Otherwise, they do not get into the pores and do not help. Much sage tea is recommended to drink. It helps the anxiety and also the sweating for the hands disinfect them. Often, I have the feeling since bona started, where I need to disinfect them more often that it helps, and I also disinfect them when I feel their getting sweaty again. Contra is you might need a hand creme after few months, because it takes away hydration. Also, botox helps against sweating a lot. But I would keep that in mind. As last option, friend of mine has botox in her armpits seems to work. Great. Sorry, english is not my fist language, but I hope you understand it. Fine confusion. So get a shower.Gel with tea tree or aktiv lemon drink sage tea vichy deo is awesome at least for meconfusion disinfect your hands

I have had this issue since I was a kid, always felt really uncomfortable with having to announce myself in class or whatever I think with me it was being bullied that made me feel this way, and then I never really fixed it. I have gotten better as I got older, but since december, I started suffering from such bad anxiety that I am beginning to become more introverted again to the point that walking into a room with people is a challenge. Now, meaning my anxiety starts to increase due to feelings of inadequacy around colleagues or whateverconfusion. If you are still young and in a position to change what is happening with you, I would do it asap. I often feel that at the age of almost that, it is too late for me. And that is a terrifying feeling, to be honest.

Less I completely understand. I played cards against humanity with a group of new friends and had an entire moment for an hour where it was like my brain stopped working. I freaked myself out so bad that about picking a card and reading it out loud that I was stuck in this spot where I couldnt even process what the cards said. And my friends sat there and laughed at me and encouraged it forever. It was crazy and seemed so stupid the next day to think about, but I genuinely could not process what the cards said, and it almost scared me to speak. Sorry to rant, but I could use some advice too

I saw a very graphic picture days ago and I still remember it and it pops out of my mind randomly. It makes me anxious but not serious. I think I will forget it, but im still scared so how do I forget this more faster? Im bad at english. Sry

Same thing for me. And also, if I try to forget about it faster, the more it starts to haunt me, it slowly disappears from your mind. While you are busy with other things, try to relax your mind and do not panic about it. I know it is hard, but it seems like the only way that works for me.

So finally, after working in a really toxic workplace environment for years, I got offered a new job. As soon as the woman on the phone offered me the job, I started crying and she asked me what the matter? I told her I was feeling really overwhelmed, scared due to change really scares me. But I know deep down, this is what I need. I need a change. I need to move on. I need something different, and this will be good for me. I felt so embarrassed crying on the phone, and my brain was telling me, why are you crying? Stop crying, because you will make a bad impression. She must be thinking, why the hell is this girl crying? She was actually quite understanding and told me to give her a call back when I am a bit more calm anyway, I accepted the job offer, and I am so happy I am finally leaving a workplace that has affected my mental health so much

That is so awesome. I did the same thing late last year just be aware of your anxiety when you are trying to fit in. I am years old and did not think I would be dealing with the same pressures I did when I was in high school we all want to be accepted. It has been a godsend making the change. And while initially at first, I regretted the change be I hate change. It was a change I wished I had made years ago. Maybe home life would have been better, but I have also learned some coping mechanisms since then. Tho best of luck to you and I am proud of you for making the leap you can finally breathe and put all that bad stuff behind you take care

Not the most professional thing you could have done, but it really does not matter. I think the best part of the hiring manager day is to hire someone who really wants the job. Your outburst of emotion did show that you want the job, and they are always going to prefer someone who appreciates the job over someone who is entitled and robotic. So good luck with the new job. But keep the emotional outbursts outside of the workplace as much as you reasonably can. You got this

I just walked out of my job thursday. It was full of toxic racism, and nothing was ever done about it. Even after I reported to he, I could not sleep at night. I would wake up at am and toss and turn. I have lost labs in the last month because could not eat. I am currently on different anxiety and depression medications. I think I can finally stop taking them now that I do not have to show up to that nightmare.

I cannot wait for this day. My anxiety is purely from my job, because I am involved in products that can end up harming people. New management is unknowledgeable and reckless. I have anxiety about every little thing related to work. Now, because of it, I cannot wait. Good luck. Op this is well deserved.

I am in the same situation as you, except I am on the other side. I ve been with my new job, and away from the toxic one for monthsconfusion. My experience is that my previous job is still affecting my mental health, because I feel even more anxious at my new job than my old one, and I am finding it very hard to allow myself to get close to my coworkers and trust them, especially my supervisorconfusion. I think subconsciously, I am expecting to get hurt the way my previous supervisor hurt me, which is causing me even more anxiety. Hopefully, something I can work on with my new therapist. I just wanted to share this with you, because your experience may be similar to mine after you start your new job. I do not mean to be a downer. I just want you to be prepared if you start feeling the way I do at your new job, otherwise congrats. I am happy that you got away from a toxic situation. I am proud of you for putting yourself out there, because I know how hard anxiety can make that good job internet stranger.

I left my toxic job of years last year when I got my job offer. I was so scared but accepted I was so scared I would cry and constantly ask my husband if this was a normal feeling am I doing the right thing everyone was so happy for me and I was just dreading it even tho I hated my last job. Fast forward to months later, I have met the most amazing coworkers, and when I felt comfortable enough, I was honest with them and told them about my anxiety issues, they were so understanding and just them knowing made me feel better. Knowing that if I need to take a moment or if I start having anxiety, I can be honest about what is happening. My mental health has improved so much. I know it is hard, but leaving a toxic place may be better for your mental health and you might make a friend or two. I mean, I am sure you know how hard is making friends when you have anxiety? I know I struggle anyways. Good luck. I am sure it will all work out woozy face.

So when I first started smoking weed, I think it did help with my anxiety and insomnia. But when it became a daily habit it absolutely made me more anxious. But like I just kept doing it cuz I was anxious or bored to start anyway or I would just smoke more hoping to calm down and put myself to sleep. But instead I would just be tense and awake and ugh when quitting at first I hated lying awake sober like if I was going to have insomnia, at least I could be high. The big change for me was I found a partner I loved and lying awake next to them in bed listening to them breathe was actually pretty pleasant and I was not anxious about the fact that I was not sleeping or was not high or whatever. The last time I tried weed again, it was just immediately full body tension did not enjoy. Unfortunately, neither I nor a doctor can prescribe you a boyfriend or girlfriend. If it fits into your lifestyle, though you could consider a pet. Obviously, dog would be best, but don flip out on. Meconfusion rats actually make fabulous little companions. And if you bond with them young, they will hang out in bed with you while you try to sleep and they def play with you while you are sober.

My of recently did this too for a number of reasons. He been smoking daily for almost years and it was starting to negatively impact things like his appetite, sleeping schedule and even his libido he also finds that when he gets baked, he has issues with his lymph nodes which after a bit of googling we have found to be an almost common issue with people. I also quit smoking daily. I basically told him that we should stop smoking at home and only really bust it out if we are at a friend house or a gathering after dinner so that the appetite, weird sleeping and lack of sexual desire will not really matter. He been having weird dreams lately, though, which is also apparently something that can happen, but otherwise he seems rather content with his sobriety methinks, you should find some other kind of coping mechanism. I have started using a little tip I found somewhere on reddit that is been helping me when I get randomly paranoid and anxious, say out loud things. You can see things you can hear moving parts of your body and move them. As you say itconfusion, I find it helps bring me back to reality and stops me from focusing on the anxious feeling that overwhelms me sometimes

Title: Nervous about what my do will say and do with my medications.
Thread
I have suffered from gad since I was about over the years. It has gotten worse. I had been taking zoloft, my for a very long time. Then wellbutrin was added to help with the very unpleasant sexual side effects. It didn really helpconfusion. Zoloft was then downgraded to my, and it worked well until last december that my depression came back with a lot of racing thoughts and anxiety. Last appointment, she put me on lamictal and slowly stopped taking zoloft, I continued wellbutrin. I felt great for about days until days ago, the anxiety came back, multiplied by, I have been in a state of constant worry about everything, and I had a very bad crisis yesterday. It was horrible, almost to the point of emergency room, and I still feel quite bad. My reaction to this was to start taking zoloft again. I am on my cause. I know I have to start slowly. I have realized that I am simply unable to function without this medicine. It is the red time. I stop taking it, and I end up having horrible crises. It sucks because the sexual side effects are really bad, but it is either I do not function well in the bedroom or I do not function well anywhere at all. After that long introduction, my worry now is if my doctor will be mad at me for starting the zoloft again without asking her, she is impossible to reachconfusion. I also feel like the short period of time iWas taking zoloft and lamictal together. Things were going well, I am now afraid of seeing my doctor. What if she does not want to prescribe me zoloft again or does not want to give me this combination that seemed to work well, I need some guidance. What would you
Comments
I have done this, but with different medication, I have been seeing the same psychiatrist for years, and he is fantastic. I would just call and say, I am not doing well and would like to go back on. For me, it was wellbutrin. I cannot imagine they would be disagreeable about.

Sounds like anxiety to me, I get cold where no at of heat helps with heat. I now have two unpleasant sensations that you would think would cancel each other out. But nope, its as if there is an internal thermostat problem. Its as if the cold feeling is anxiety telling you are cold, but the usual ways to counteract coldness will not work. Its like I am shivering inside from unconscious emotions and not from a temperature issue. Anxiety hijacks the thermostat hang in there.

Title: Is what I am going through anxiety attacks.
Thread
I am going to try to explain this the best I can. This happens to me maybe twice a year, however, have gone years without it occurring and has happened in a month before. I have always assumed it anxiety or panic attacks, but never talked to a doctor about it, but maybe I should. Luckily for me, it does not happen so frequently that I felt I needed to. I am a year old male bow. I remember the it time I felt like this was in high school but did not happen again until I was like it happened today at work. At least it began to, and I made an excuse to walk away and kind of centered myself and felt better a few minutes after. But it happened again. Like, hours later, when I got home again, I was about to breathe it out. I guess, to be honest, I do not think I ever let it really peak like it wants to, besides that it time in high school, I am scared to have that happen again. I will add that I do not think I am really stressed out about anything right now, at least that I am aware of. Maybe my body knows something I don. Okay. Let me try to explain how it feels it a feeling of danger, my heart races, but the wierd thing and kind of the reason I am posting this to see if anyone else feels this way. But these attacks, if thatIs what they are begin with a feeling I can only describe as the feeling you get when you have deja vu it always that feeling of deja vu it so wierd maybe it has something to do with a trigger or something but when it happened today I was helping a co worker talking when all of a sudden I get that deja vu feeling then that feeling of danger or doom is that deja vu feeling normal in anxiety attacks or is there a better way to describe this feeling? Is this anxiety or maybe another issue when I google anxiety attacks and deja vu I get result about seizures and stuff like that anyways thanks for reading and replying with answers advice if you can not sure if I explained myself correctly, but ill keep an eye out for replies and will answer any questions. Thanks again.

What kind of danger like a fight or flight, kind of danger or feeling of being trapped? Certainly, sounds like it could be a mild symptom of anxiety. Can you link any kind of situational aspects between every time you have had one?

I know it is a broken record but definitely try to stay away from the news I know that is easier said than done since I still find myself doomscrolling the instant I wake up in the morning but even cutting back a little bet has helped me greatly the news has exclaimed that invasion was imminent all month I think even longer than that in fact the news has stated that the of february would be the date of invasion today is the it might also be worth noting that I ve heard people from both sides of the conflict people from ukraine and russia saying that they are going about their lives as normal as if there was not the threat of looming war being covered all over the news and internet it the news that is being hyperbolic about the situation

Title: Am I losing my mind?
Thread
Referencing my previous post on this sub long story short, I called the police because I was hearing things and thought someone was in my house and there was not. After a full sweep, heard the dead bolt in my living room lock possible footsteps and the lamp in my front room turned off on its own. Tonight, my lamp did the exact same thing. I am sure there is no one here, but how is the lamp doing that? I do not know if they can short and turn off like that, but it is the second time this has happened this week. My so is not in town, and I am just worried

Lets just say you did hear voices that were not there in order for it to be something like schizophrenia or psychosis. You will have to continue to hear things for a prolonged time. Also, did you hear these voices while you were in bed, falling asleep or where you fully alert?

I used to not know but then I narrowed it down. I am sure therapy goes through all this and I am just self diagnosing, but I think it is good to figure out why it is happening and understand the triggers. Itll help manage it going forward. Also, if you have just starting feeling symptoms, I strongly recommend nipping it in the bud quick before it festers into something else.

Fear has evolved in humans to protect us from real, physical dangers to life and bodily harm. Without fear, you and your ancestorsconfusion would walk into lions dens, try to cuddle with bears and play with wolf packs. Many humans did this got killed, and they did not have children. We who are alive today are children of those humans who chose to be afraid or were afraid, and so stayed away from dangers. Sometimes it was not possible to fully understand some dangers, like foreign tribes or other groups. Again, those who tried to be friendly with other groups, like the native american peopleconfusion ended up dead, and those who live today are descendants of people who decide to give importance to fears. Long story short fear is supposed to be your best friend. As far as protecting your life and saving you from injury is concerned. Also, creativity is essential for problem solving, and imagination is what separates us from animals who cannot really build streams of ideas. In their brains. They are creatures of limited habit. Now, when you fear in reasonable amounts for i, when you see a guy with a gun that is valid and critical for your safety. But when your brain and limbic system go into overdrive and start fearing things that are not physically there, or when you start fearing things that do not cause harm to life or limb, then you have a disorder don. Let your best friend trouble you. Excess fear defeats it. Purpose ofProtecting you if it makes your life not peaceful and sane. That is the primary stated purpose of fear. So learn to actively differentiate by talking to yourself if needed between real danger and perceived or imagined danger compare with what other people feel. If everyone else feels that whatever you fear is not dangerous, then simply label it as neurological malfunction, which it essentially is, and ignore it and continue life while ignoring it. A running self commentary is very useful. Now I am getting scared of random stuff. Now I getting scared of xyz, which is unreasonable. Now I am threatening myself with excessive consequences, which nobody else does. Now I am blowing things way out of proportion and so on. In addition, affirm a few basic truths. Fear is my friend. It loses its entire point of existence. If it starts to hurt me like this, there is no danger at the moment, I will deal with this when it actually happens, rather than waste time. Now, when has worrying, ever solved anything? Acting has solved problems, but never worrying? An idle mind is a devil workshop. Let me get busy with something meaningful. I just postpone this thinking for seconds. The situation will not change, but I take a small break from worrying as long as you cannot realise that, or convince your scared mind that the danger is absent. Learn to take scheduled breaks from worrying by telling the scared mind. I need to take a second break, or else iWill be in even more danger this usually works as the scared mind only wants to respond to dangers not to positive thoughts out danger the imagined danger and take a break from worrying once your scared mind sees that taking breaks from worrying does not reduce its safety it will get used to taking longer breaks from worrying soon it will be able to postpone worrying indefinitely and at will at this point you have successfully learned to manage anxiety this change is usually permanent and will speed up recovery if you need urgent relief from anxiety try emir tapping butterfly hugging yoga poses and jacobson as described in the links below hugging tight pillows having cold showers drinking cool water not coldconfusion eating foods that make you sleepy are all useful tricks everything needed apart from medicationconfusion to reduce anxiety by is in here it quite a bit and it takes time but it is worth itconfusion

I am reading a book right now and I came across the what ifs here is a little bit what it says I struggle with the same thing. The anxiety loop. Its at this point in time where people get split into those that develop an anxiety disorder and those that dont. The real deciding factor is whether a person gets caught in the anxiety loop or not. The anxiety loop is a mental trap, a vicious cycle of fearing fear. Instead of ignoring anxious thoughts or bodily sensations, the person becomes acutely aware and paranoid of them. What if I lose control and do something crazy? What if those sensations come back again while I am in a meeting? What if it is a sign of a serious health problem? This trap is akin to quicksand. Our immediate response is to struggle hard to free ourselves, but it is the wrong response. The more we struggle, the deeper we sink. There is a few more pages on it. Let me know if you want me to paste it on here and I will

What if my heart does not stop pounding? What if I have a panic attack here in the car? What if this constant anxiety does not go away? What if I faint? Who will help me? What if my mind never stops obsessing with these thoughts? Since prehistoric times, our minds have been wired to seek out potential threats and to then avoid them. The world we lived in then was often a life or death environment. And what ifs were a useful cognitive process that developed to keep us out of immediate danger? What if that shadow behind that bush is a predator best to back away today? However, it is rare? Fortunately, confusion to encounter a life or death moment. So our minds turn inwards instead looking for those same life threatening situations that are almost always imagined or exaggerated. What if that pounding heart means I am about to have a heart attack? What if I lose my job and cannot feed myself or my family? Notice that these? What ifs almost never revolve around good things potentially happening? Like, what if someone surprises me with good news today? What if the doctor says I am in great health? Our thoughts did not evolve like this, because in prehistoric times, it was better to be cautious and guarded than optimistic and carefree if anxious? What ifs are not responded to correctly and quickly defused? They tend to spiral out of control, leaping from one catastrophic thought to another before. You know it, theseWhat ifs have triggered a tidal wave of adrenaline and fear what if what if and then what if you cannot stop the initial waves of anxiety or the what if thoughts that cross your mind they manifest outside your control what you can always control is your response to them in order to defuse anxious what ifs you need to answer the question in the right way and limit the potential for the anxiety to increase a good response to a what if is so what if my heart does not stop pounding so what my hearts an incredibly strong muscle this is nothing more than a light workout for it what if I have a panic attack here in the car so what il pull over and get through it like I have always done in the past what if I faint in public who will help me so what if I faint I faint? Someone will help me and in two minutes il be conscious again. What if my mind never stops obsessing with these thoughts? So what thoughts are just thoughts and cannot harm me? Eventually, my anxious mind will settle and the thoughts will dissipate. It does not matter if you do not fully believe in your own responses to these questions. The key point here is to quickly defuse the buildup of fear by answering the what ifs in the right way with a strong so what attitude answering with? So what is effective because it neutralizes the fear andPlaces you back into a position of power, if so, what does not feel like the appropriate response for you? Then come up with your own response, like whatever or oh, well, some members of my coaching program like to be less passive and more direct. So they jokingly say, whaf, who gives a confusion? The important thing is to illicit a dismissive attitude toward your fears. As long as you come up with something dismissive of the initial, what if thought it will have the right effect? Oftentimes, there is no clear what if thought that you can identify rather just a general feeling of foreboding that comes with the wave of anxious discomfort.

I have suffered from gad since I was about over the years. It has gotten worse. I had been taking zoloft, my for a very long time. Then wellbutrin was added to help with the very unpleasant sexual side effects. It didn really helpconfusion. Zoloft was then downgraded to my, and it worked well until last december that my depression came back with a lot of racing thoughts and anxiety. Last appointment, she put me on lamictal and slowly stopped taking zoloft, I continued wellbutrin. I felt great for about days until days ago, the anxiety came back, multiplied by, I have been in a state of constant worry about everything, and I had a very bad crisis yesterday. It was horrible, almost to the point of emergency room, and I still feel quite bad. My reaction to this was to start taking zoloft again. I am on my cause. I know I have to start slowly. I have realized that I am simply unable to function without this medicine. It is the red time. I stop taking it, and I end up having horrible crises. It sucks because the sexual side effects are really bad, but it is either I do not function well in the bedroom or I do not function well anywhere at all. After that long introduction, my worry now is if my doctor will be mad at me for starting the zoloft again without asking her, she is impossible to reachconfusion. I also feel like the short period of time iWas taking zoloft and lamictal together. Things were going well, I am now afraid of seeing my doctor.

Title: Anxiety attack caused disassociation, lots of memory loss.

Recently I had a big anxiety attack and I experienced some things that I know are possible but were new to me and I find them interesting even though they are also kind of scary so I am wondering if anyone else has experienced it I should mention that I had a decent amount to drink that night I was not hammered by any means but I was drunk a bit more than half a bottle of wine and a couple beers earlier in the day I also started taking prozac a bit over a month ago and was hours late taking my pill that night took it while on the phone with my friendconfusion I was in an airbnb with my boyfriend and I do not really remember how it started exactly but he was also drunk and was trying to help but I needed to call my best friend for help to calm down because I was in a full panic like hyperventilating harder than I ever have before like dog in a hot car speed to the point of barely being able to breathe for a couple minutes straight which probably added to the other symptoms thanks to some lack of oxygen anyway I kept getting very confused similar to what happens when you take psychedelics and lose yourself a little bit she was getting me to count backwards to calm down and I could repeat after her just fine but when I tried to do it on my own I would startCounting up instead or just repeat the same number a few times and forget I was counting. I said I wanted to dunk my head in cold water because I was really hot. So abby told me to get a bowl of water and dip my face in but I did not want to get up and then I forgot about that. So she mentioned it and I said, oh, what a great idea, as if she just thought of it. And that happened a few times because I kept forgetting I was also getting really frustrated because I could not figure out why the hell I was having such a severe anxiety attack because I was having a great weekend. But there was actually a small thing that triggered it just before. But I could not remember that until much later. After the phone call, I was feeling cold, so my boyfriend said, we should sit in the shower for a while. So we did, and I got really confused in there, too. I could not remember where we were and I kept thinking we were back in my home city. We were visiting friends a four hour drive away. I also forgot his name and who he was. I knew that I knew him and that I loved him and trusted him, but I did not know who he was. He explained it to me and kept asking me small questions and keeping me calm until I could remember again. I was also frustratedAbout that. Then I was freezing cold to the point of shivering and my teeth chattering hard, even while in the hot shower stream. So we got out and dried off, and he helped me get dressed in warm clothes. And then I passed out. As soon as I layed down for like minutes, most of that was told to me the next day I have small bits of memory. I remember being frustrated. I remember needing to call my friend, repeating after her to count down and realizing I would forgotten to take my pill. I remember forgetting my boyfriend, and I remember my teeth chattering that it, and I have minor to no visuals attached to any of these memories, just the words. The next day, I was tired, for sure, but otherwise, normal tldr had a huge anxiety attack while at an airbnb with my boyfriend. Severe, hyperventilating, had to call my bestfriend, kept getting really confused, forgot my boyfriend. And where I was freezing in a hot shower, could barely remember that chunk of approximately hours. The next day,

I take it before bed when my anxiety is high or early in the evening. I started with a low dose but boosted it to a higher one, because I only use it when I have high anxiety. If it works, it can sometimes replicate the feeling of being just on the edge of falling asleep, which is super relaxing. It does not always do anything, but it is a nice trick when it does work.

Title: Shoveling snow anxiety.
Thread
Does anyone else have the irrational fear of dropping dead after shoveling snow for back story in my area? You cannot go a year without hearing of someone you know or someone else knows? Dropping dead of a massive heart attack while shoveling snow? My biggest anxiety source is my heart, which has been checked and re checked, stress tests, eggs, etc. And I am told, is super healthy. But every time I got to shovel that stupid white powder, I spend the next few hours terrified of any ache or pain in my upper body, just wondering if anyone else deals with anything that insane
Comments
My anxiety is more of not knowing my limits. If it is any reassurance, your body will stop you from having a heart attack long before you actually have one, especially if you have no preexisting heart condition. I do not know of anyone that actually pulled a john henry with snow before. If you are really worried, there are heart rate trackers you can use, but so long as your heart rate is in your body safe range, you should be gucci. But yes, having to shovel snow is annoying. I try to use a machine to do as much of it as possible, and I pace myself to have a break half way through. If I know the snow is going to be particularly high, I will throw the fresh first layer. So I have less later. It not like you cannot hurt yourself, like, with back pains. A lot of people buy giant shovels or machines they have to over strain themselves to use. If you go to a gym, you can find out very quickly how many reps you can lift at a third or quarter your weight before fatigue. If I weigh my shovel fully loaded with heavy snow, I get almost la and feels like la. At the end of the lever arm of the shovel. I can do about reps at that weight before I am winded, so I count, and if I can do half that weight, I can extend my reps exponentially. There are complete studies ofThe human body and it is limits if that peaks your interests happy face or smiley

Title: I have been staying in a tech support job that wears me down but have too much anxiety to quit.
Thread
I have been working a job that is terrible for my anxiety mental health the last months it a first point of contact, helpdesk support job. What makes it worse is that I used to work in a higher level role but was convinced by a now exconfusion friend, I needed to jump to a new role. Big mistake. I spent the first few months hating myself for being in this role. But seeing my psychologist has been sort of helpful, although it does not help that I occasionally get abuse from customers over the phone. The most recent abuse was an angry customer over the phone swearing while I was trying to escalate his call to a higher level support. He refused to end the call, and I had to leave him on mute for or so minutes as I was trying to get this escalated. At one point, he swore over the phone very loudly. While I had him muted. I finished the call as I requested him with a shakey voiceconfusion to end the call, so a senior engineer can reach out to him. I ended up crying right after I ve got cptsd from child abuse, so angry men yelling at me is a bit of a triggerconfusion. Despite all this terrible work picking up calls all day, I have phone anxiety. Every phone call, I have to hype myself upconfusion. I still cannot put in my resignation letter because these following thoughts crop up. My manager is nice to me. WhatWill they think of me when I put in the resignation letter? What would the team think of me? I have only been here less than a year and I am already leaving. I deserve to be where I am looking like a failure, not able to hold a job for even a year because of this, I choose to not do anything about my situation, all because I am too scared to actually put in the action required to resign, which eats at me so much does anyone else relate to this feeling frown, sad, angry or pouting

Your mental health should come first. And even for a normal person, a tech support helpdesk job is taxing. My manager is nice to me. What will they think of me when I put in the resignation letter, resignations in a helpdesk job is normal. Your manager knows it cannot be helped. Don worry about what they will think they all understand compared to managers of other positions. Helpdesk managers are actually more understanding than you would think. What would the team think of me? I have only been here less than a year and I am already leaving. People have quit a month in. You should be praised for even holding that position for months while fighting with anxiety. I deserve to be where I am looking like a failure, not able to hold a job for even a year. Naw! The job just is not for you. It a job where you get yelled at all day. It not for anyone with yelling triggers. Finally, put yourself first before your manager and teammates. They re not the ones suffering. It is you. The sooner you send your resignation, the earlier your mind can take a break.

Title: I think I figured out how to explain what chronic anxiety like.
Thread
I was talking to my mom about it earlier, I said, wherever I go, its like im in a space suit, and im afraid to take my helmet off. Thats what its like. No matter where you are, you cant really feel anything or be in the moment because youre in your spacesuit like there isnt air to breathe out there. And its not safe, and you cant relax until you get back to your spaceship where theres an air bubble. Like, everywhere you go, you have to wear your space suit. Its hard to hear people through the thick glass on your helmet, and they have a hard time hearing you, too. You cant even really hug anyone or hold hands because the suit is super thick and uncomfortable, and you cant really participate in anything. You just have to watch. The suits too heavy to run around in like everyone else is just out there, and they can go wherever they want. Theyare free. They dont need a space suit, but not you. Its not for you out there. Its too dangerous for you have to stay in the safety of your spacesuit and wait at home in your spaceship. Wait for the day that you finally get the courage to go out there. Close your eyes and take your helmet off to see what its like to breathe real air for the first time to see if you dont need the space suit anymore, but not today. Youll be safe in your spaceSuit youll stay behind the sealed door of your spaceship maybe tomorrow youll take off your helmet but not really its way too dangerous

Doing something physical can help. Also, I recently started doing vibroacoustic therapy, and it helps a lot, but really anything that changes your brain state can help meditation, exercise, acupuncture concerts, movies, brain tap tapping, etc.

Thats a good analogy. My favourite so far is one I read while playing celeste, where the protagonist is asked, what does depression feel like? She replies it like I am in the bottom of the ocean? I cannot see anything yet I feel exposed. Depression is strongly linked with anxiety, and that quote still resonates with me when my anxiety gets bad.

Title: Anxiety manifests and is becoming a more real problem.
Thread
I have dealt with anxiety all my life and all the stupid things that come with it. Depression being one of them. My answer to that was alcohol, but due to recent health concerns, I have quit alcohol after many years of drinking it. Now, a tidal wave of anxiety is here to kick my ass. This time, it is not just social anxiety that was already debilitating and stopping me from living life. It now evolved into health anxiety, not just for myself, but for loved ones hypochondria, as a result of anxiety and being so alone, because I have no friends, because I do not know how to speak to make them. Not only that, the anxiety is manifesting physical symptoms, tight chest, throat, heart palpitations, tachycardia, which can often trigger a panic state. Its a bottomless pit, and often nothing satisfies it. The only thing that did was the alcohol, and I have no intentions of going back to that. Most of what my anxiety is causing is heart palpation and tachycardia. As ive said, ive dealt with anxiety all my life its never felt as bad as this, and im not actually feeling anxious. In mind, it feels more automatic, like it comes on its own, and at any little trigger.
Comments
This is me exactly. I have extreme anxiety and hypochondria, so I never know what is real and what isnt, which is a very powerless feeling. I have been having neuropathy symptoms for months now, and I do not have the money for an mri. I feel like I am in a constant state of panic, weary face.

Title: How do you convince yourself that your symptoms are not a disease, chronic condition or illnessits just anxiety?
Thread
I have had numbness tingling, tremors in my fingers and hands and so forth for a long time now, and they have gotten somewhat worse over time. I have also been chronically stressed and anxious for years. I want to believe that my symptoms are stemming from anxiety, but I am terrified of going to a doctor and being diagnosed with essential tremors is parkinson's, etc. How do I stop worrying about this without going to a doctor? Have you found any solutions for fighting your health anxiety? I think I read stuff online. And then I am convinced. It has to be that
Comments
I know this might not be what you want to hear but I going to the doctor to get my symptoms checked out really helpful yes you do not want to be calling them every time you worry about your health but if there is a symptom which has been bothering you for a while and you have not got it checked out you should absolutely make an appointment in terms of other things you might find it helpful to remind yourself that anxiety and stress can cause a whole array of symptoms and the more you focus on and worry about them the worse they are going to feel that does not mean there is anything wrong with you though having a symptom, which is a potential red flag for is parkinson etc. Just means it is worth getting checked out just in case not that you definitely do have whatever serious illness you are worried about more long term I would really encourage you to get help for your anxiety and stress. Happy face or smiley

Title: My anxiety. Social anxiety is going to cost me my job some day.
Thread
So I work at a trade show, exhibiting warehouse, where I have to do logistical work for upcoming shows, inventory and build exhibits for our clients to be previewed, then shipped out. I am generally good at my job and have even gotten plenty of good feedback from the higher ups. But the illogical anxious part of my brain refuses to allow me to believe. So the anxiety and self doubt usually kick in during group projects, or if I feel as if I am being watched, no matter how good I am at something or how many times I have done it, my brain goes blank when I get this feeling the anxiety takes over, and it is as if my iq drops points. For example, today, I was helping a coworker modify a booth, and I had the simple task of wrapping a blanket around a counter so it would not get damaged in transit. Pretty fucking easy. A child could do it right. I awkwardly attempted. So trembling as my brain only focuses on my co workers perception of me, resulting in him laughing and doing it himself. Afterwards, I feel physically ill from embarrassment and can only imagine hes laughing with other coworkers of my stupidity. I do not understand my lack of confidence in my abilities, as well as my severe inferiority complex. When I am left to work alone, I effortlessly run through projects with zero mistakes. I came in alone for overtime and built a it high exhibit inLess than hours. So why cannot I do the same when people are helping me I feel like this issue will only keep me from progressing and utilizing my full potential is this just me I feel incredibly alone with this issue and am thinking of therapy as a last resort feel free to comment if you can relate or are going through something similar twink or smirk work performance hindered by fear of judgment. Low self esteem and social anxiety cannot seem to overcome this.

Title: Worried about something I did at school today.
Thread
Since this past week or so I have been getting. I have been getting horrible anxiety about what I am searching on the internet, especially about school. I turned a few months ago, and since then, I have been in fear of doing illegal things because I have a huge fear of getting any kind of criminal record and going to jail. So in my philosophy class, there was an article we read about this guy who had a abusive childhood and killed two young boys later on in his life. The point was, how our past determines who we are and the decisions we make. I have add and hate reading. So instead of reading the three pages of the article, I search up the first question on the internet was so and so morally responsible for what he did, something like that. This article was from forty years ago, and midwest is probably long gone in my head. The next hour, I had a sudden anxiety attack inside, because I was connected to our schools. Wi fi, when I searched it, I do not want to get suspended, placed on some warning list or anything like that. I do not know if the school is going to see this or not, and I am very worried

I just want to stop. I am tired. I am sick. I am fed up. I have been battling this for a while now, and it is only getting worse. It seems as I try to better myself.

All life is suffering, but there is a way to enjoy the suffering. Let go of the judgements about yourself. Let go of the self, the ego. You are the universe, experiencing itself, and one you see this see that your existence is fundamental to universe, and you start to love it all and be it all, you can be free. Get a virtual guru. Listen to ram dass or alan watts or exchart toll, or sam harris or all of them, and discover who you really are.

I am, and in generally good health, vegan diet, and I am big into weightlifting, but my anxiety is controlling me. I have had multiple bouts of anxiety over the years short of breath, stomach pains, chest pains, and every time I have gotten multiple tests done, and each time it is been anxiety, I have been on and off meds over the years, which brings me to the last two weeks of headaches, some nausea and brain zaps, or tingling on the side of my head. I have started to take medication again, busiproneconfusion. I am just so afraid that it is not anxiety, and it is something much worse. Has anyone else experienced this? Its really the tingling on the side of my head that is freaking me out. I have been to the doctor, and that is why I am back on the meds.

Are you taking anything supplements or moreconfusion for weightlighting any change here? Have you always been vegan or is that newer there is nothing to be scared about you have a plan, try some drugs and see if that works. If not, the doc will run some other tests whatever it is worrying will not help.

Yeah, I experience this. I get brain zaps and coldness all over the back of my head. I then panic, and it feels like my whole face is numb. I currently have a headache now it sucks. Dude, yesterday, my heart rate when really high and my chest started feeling tight. I thought I was going to pass out and die. I was on a bike ride too. At night, I peddled hard so I could get to my house before I blacked out. And when I got there, I was fine. Lol, I have had multiple tests done too. All good. I do find that whenever I even get a little sick, it makes the anxiety panic worse, probably because your heart rate increases when you are sick

I also started getting the anxiety feeling while driving in the last year, and you are right. It is wild if you have never experienced it before. It actually prompted me to go to therapy right away, and that, along with the tips below, have helped a lot for me. The book, unwinding anxiety by judson brewer, was good. I do audio books like that oneconfusion on commutes to work something engaging. So my brain is focusing on that and not left to its own devices. I wandering thoughts and worrying that can lead to more anxiety. I would also recommend looking into daily meditation. I liked the book, meditation for fidgety skeptics. To go along with this. The writer had a similar experience where he had a jolt of anxiety one day that kind of sparked his journey into mindfulness minutes a day or lessconfusion of meditation is incredibly helpful, and there are studies to back it up. Finally, get curious about the physical sensations that are occurring in your body. When you have a bout of anxiety, don think of them as a collective, scary thing. But as individual physical sensations try to pinpoint exactly where you feel, that tightness in your body. What else do you feel? And where do you feel? Is it hot? Cold? Tingly, I learned in therapy that all emotions have physical sensations, which was kind of mind blowing confusion. A phrase that helps me is to accept that it is happening and to hold it lightly when youNotice uncomfortable feelings resistance to the feelings for me at leastconfusion or trying to make them go away by immediately shifting to breathing a certain way or whatever can make them worse

Title: Major anxiety before turning in notice at work.
Thread
Hello. So I have been working at my current job for almost years. I have been through a lot of highs and lows with the company, but over the past three years, stuff has declined badly. Obviously, couid drove a lot of the issues for the past two years, but after years in manufacturing, I am burnt out entirely. The company itself is treating its employees terribly, and we struggle to get even the most basic supplies. Sometimes my boss is a incredibly nice guy, but he lacks a back bone, which has led to a lot of additional stress. I do not hate my work family, but the stress and burnt out feeling drove me to apply for a government job that is entirely outside of my current profession. Well, I got the job, so I officially have to turn in notice tomorrow. I feel this overwhelming ocean of anxiety about putting in my notice. I feel guilty, because my boss has really been lenient with me and my health issues over the years. Even last week, I took an ambulance ride to the hospital from work, and he is been concerned about me ever since, and we already had another person on our team turn in notice this week. So my department is barely staying afloat and I am going to make it so much worse. Tomorrow I feel guilty, leaving them and their kindness and care for me for most things confusion. Il miss being able to have some work schedule, flexibility, butWith the government I am looking at a real pension retirement student loan forgiveness and much better health insurance my health has not been getting better so I feel like this change is the best choice in the long run for me but I just do not know how to get past this anxiety and awful feeling I have about letting my team down

It will be over soon. Dont feel bad about making a choice for yourself and for your health. Losing people is part of managing a business. A good boss will understand, and you do not want to work for someone who cannot understand your choice. Congrats on the new gig. Hope it works out and you settle in quickly, dont beat around the bush. Just go in and give your notice. And thank your boss for everything they have done for you, but you are making a choice for you and your family.

Its ok to be scared of change. I work at a university, and it is perfectly normal. I would suggest touring several colleges. If you can find one that feels comfortable to you if you go to a big is, then you might be ok at a big college. If yours is small, a small college would probably be better. Its all about you. So find the one right for you. I know you are scared to lose friends or your boyfriend, but you will make some of your lifelong friends at college if you and your boyfriend love each other, then long distance is a possibility. If it does not work, it is ok. You are so young and believe me, there are good things to come. Just do not do something because you are afraid. Trust me, you will regret it forever. Just be brave and be you. The rest will work itself out red heart

You also do not have to go to college right away. I took a gap year before college and worked because I did not feel ready to leave home yet. It worked really well for me and by the end of the year, I felt ready to go to school because I was so bored at home.

I used to smoke weed all the time, but eventually it started to have a negative impact on my mental health made me super anxious. And exasperated, some mental health issues I had developed. I ended up very reclusive for several years afterward. Quitting weed definitely helped to clear my mind up and make me feel a lot more productive, healthy and capable of experiencing life sober choosing to cut out certain things has really helped to reduce my anxiety in general weed, caffeine and alcoholconfusion. Even if I did not get anxious, when I smoked weed, I do not think I would smoke. It just turns me into a potato, and it makes me feel physically mentally grungy. And that does not feel good to me. I think if you quit, you see the benefits in time don give up or get down on yourself if it takes longer than expected to start feeling better, though

I experienced this last week, not even true numbness, but not sure how to describe it was my second time having this in a few months. So decided to be safe and go to the er. No other symptoms, except some light headache type pressure in my forehead that comes and goes, and sometimes changes in breathing. Last time it went away in a day. But I do not recall if I was having anxiety at the time probably was thoughconfusion, and this time it has lingered on and off, probably because I have been super anxious. Recentlyconfusion. I saw er docs, and they all had conflicting evaluations. They did not really rule out anxiety, but said because I was not hyperventilating. I was not having an anxiety attack. One mentioned possible inflammation of a nerve or trigeminal neuralgia, but the most experienced, er doc denied it because I did not have any pain. Taj was another possibility. I have a neurology app pending, but would appreciate any advice. In the meantime, I am terrified and even more overwhelmed to have to deal with this. On top of everything, I had no idea, anxiety could have debilitating symptoms like this.

Ok, I have anxiety, and for the last years health anxiety, too, its pretty severe and affects my daily life. Its getting heavier and heavier years ago, my anxiety was manageable if that makes sense. I used to self medicate with weed, but now, even smoking weed, I cannot enjoy no more. I have physical anxiety symptoms, such as running to the er, thinking I have an heart attack, internal tremors while sleeping, stiff neck and back muscle and so on. So I have been to the doctors a lot because my mind always tells me I have a disease or something ofcourse, always fatal. So I keep obsessing, and in the end, its nothing. And when I say obsessing, I really mean that multiple doctors forwarded for an evaluation to the psychiatrist. My partner is very much affected by my anxiety. So my question is, would meds really help? I know I am at a point where a doctor, o, would prescribe me something. I am just scared I might going to depend on meds, and all the side affects, also, morgans getting damaged by daily intake. I really do not want to go to the psyche, but maybe I need it. I am scared of going cray cray

Have you tried exercising? It blows my mind. How in todays society, working out is seen as this optional thing, like a hobby, but in my opinion, it is essential like brushing your teeth or taking a shower. Heres a quote from an ex navy seal. Damn! I forgot his nameconfusion. Ive never met anybody who was anxious after doing burpees.

Medications can help a lot. If you see a therapist, you can develop healthy ways to cope with your anxiety and with time, maybe you will not need meds anymore. It all about balance, you know, working and understanding better and deeper where your anxiety comes from can reduce so much the symptoms as for the side effects, it really depends upon the medication and your personnal health. Only your doctor can answer that hope this helps.

Title: Anxiety may be replacement for other emotions you have built.
Thread
It possible for anxiety to cover up other emotions, which are harder for you to feel? I know, I know anxiety is a total bitch, and feeling it sucks more than any other emotion I feel, but it is a fact that sometimes it is easier to be completely paralyzed with fear than to feel other more complex things. To give an example, I find it very hard to be angry with me, so which led to years of sabotaging my relationships because of anxiety. Whenever I find myself with being anxious, due to my romantic relationship, I go through a checklist. Am I sad because of something she said? Am I angry with her for what she is done? Am I angry with myself for behaving certain way? Very often, my anxiety slowly transforms into anger, which I then deal with by exercise and honest talk. If an irrational fear comes up, ask yourself, what could other people feel if they were in your shoes? Maybe they would feel nothing. Maybe they would feel certain emotion. Maybe they would be anxious, too. The key is not to judge yourself for not feeling certain way, but trying to gather perspective and try to find out if what you are feeling is really anxiety or something else more about anxiety. Being secondary emotion could be found thereembarrassed or blushing.

Yeah, pretty much any emotion turns into anxiety when it reaches a certain level anger, sadness and even excitement. But usually I can easily tell. That is what it started as handling my anxiety from there is a different story. Usually I just try to avoid things that make me feel anything too strongly, but sometimes its just unavoidable.

Personally, I understood this. I try to be sympathetic with everyone, cause I consider myself a empathetic soul, still drained me in my path to learning stuff, because taking in other emotions get to be to much. By doing that, it created even more of an anxiety whirl within. Trying to pin point the emotions and learn from yourself is a huge step that I still would encourage people to do.

Title: Unexplainable feeling bring me to tears.
Thread
Theres this weird feeling I have experienced for a while it occurs when I am in a silent room, save for background noises such as wind outside or a running furnace. Ac at times including tonight, I will just be sitting, and it will seem that the silent grows louder, yet at the same time, everything grows more silent tonight. It kept happening over and over, while I was playing a game on my phone and I nearly burst into tears because I was so uncomfortable and anxious. Can someone please tell me I am making sense?
Comments
Wish I knew what it is but I sometimes get similar experiences most often I cry if I meditate or just become aware of how alone I am in a given momentconfusion it started during a toxic relationship and kind of continues after so I am guessing there is a lot of pain which needs to be healed and come out in those moments when I am present for it or maybe it forces it is way out in these symptoms when not dealt with consciously that just one guess from what I have experienced would it make any sense in your situation

I would explore diaphragmatic breathing. Its about taking load off your lungs and utilising less oxygen, not hyperventilating, and taking in too much air in the moment. If you cannot breathe at allconfusion, it is a medical emergency, and you need to make that known in some manner. If it is shortness of breath, then there are a large number of breathing techniques and ways to slow your breathing that can get you to relax. I would google diaphragmatic breathing and shortness of breath. There are great resources available

I am in the process of quitting too well, I am tapering down somewhat slowly to mitigate potential withdrawal. I was smoking everyday, went down to a my edible for a few days, then a my edible a day for a few days, and then taking a cod. No, the whatsoeverconfusion gummy for the next weekconfusion. Its rough, because for the past few years, I have smoked every day, and it is become a part of my nightly routine to unwind and feel happy ish. I thought it was helping my anxiety and depression, but I have learned long term use misuse can actually result in worsened anxiety, depression, anhedonia, etc. When you are not smoking from what I have read, it is out of your body after about days, but you will not feel the full cognitive effects until about a month after quitting. So as I return to whatever my natural baseline is, il be using some self guided journals and books the power of nowconfusion to work through the root of my anxiety and depression. I do recommend tapering down via cod gummies oil. If it is available for you. As I have found, it does help with withdrawal and cravings and does not have the psychological effects that the has. The self guided journals are kind of fun, too best of luck. Op you got this its daunting at first, but with a little self care, love, you can do it, youre not alone. Happy face or smiley

The last part about getting annoyed when someone disturbs your peace I can relate to. I enjoy my routines even when I am sober. But when high, I do think it gets harder to deviate from them. I am a pretty high strung, irritable person anyway. But when high, I think I am less able to deal with those irritable feelings. Maybe it is time for me to cut back too. Anyways. I hope you are feeling better soon.

My experience was not so much that weed degraded my mental health directly but it did alter my behaviors and over time that affected my mental health. I smoked almost daily for a few years to ease anxiety and depression. It would make me happy and content in the moment and I learned how it feels to be content with life and myself from that time but it also prevented me from feeling motivated to do the things that I really wanted needed to do to improve myself and my life in a lot of ways I would always be disappointed that I was not growing as a person. Moderation and balance can be a hard thing to achieve, but it is so important to work toward smoking was an easy escape. But ultimately I was stuck. I eased myself off when I quit a job I hated a couple of years ago and then started a new job. And my husband and I started talking about having a family currently pregnant and sober husband still uses marijuana daily. But he and I are different, and he has a good head about it all. He will ease up as we are closer to our due date. I look forward to striving toward more balance in my life. Learning to be content and working to be better at the same time, obviously, having kids will change everything, and neither of us will be leading the lives we did in our twenties. But maybe rewarding myself with aNight of smoking, drinking, if I accomplish a goal, go for a run, do yoga, etcconfusion, and limit it to weekends, or a certain number of times a week.

Sometimes I feel alone. I feel like a burden. When I tell people about my anxiety, I do not want to bring anyone down, so usually I suffer in silence. I also do not want to be looked at as lesser for my anxiety, because I am not normal. I am so used to my anxiety being brushed off and being told to calm down that it is gotten to the point where I do not ask for help. I shut down and I go through it alone. It just really heavy sometimes. And I wish that I could tell someone without wondering if they think less of me or being afraid. They are not going to understand

I have come to find the people who say to calm down are usually just ignorant and do not really understand what is going on. It seems like you would bring others down, but just like anxiety, it is usually blown out of proportion, and people want to help you through it. Some not, but you do not want to associate with those kinds of people. Anyway, youre very strong to have gone through what you have alone. I think if you really want help, you should talk to a licensed professional, either in general or for the anxiety. Specifically, when do you feel anxious or alone? Sometimes being alone can be great

There are basic community resources in the sidebar right side of the pageconfusion in this subreddit to become part of a community of people who understand from experience, most things that you are going through. This sub is without doubt one of the nicest subs on reddit and full of kind and supportive people I think we do a lot less voice communication, but that is not for lack of the platform. It is because most people do not like to talk to strangers about anxiety and want to hide behind text posts and chats. Heck, if you post on this sub, you are probably part of the minority that posts, rather than the majority that lurks and reads but cannot find the courage to post. The reason I stress on making online friends for anxiety is that if the misbehave or if there is some miscommunication, you can immediately disconnect them from your life without them, ever knowing who you are and where you live at the same time, you can practise all the social and conversational skills you need to before you try them out in the real world with potentially less sensitive people or uninformed people. In addition, here is a purely technical perspective on being alone, lonely, which is more of a feeling than a realityconfusionembarrassed or blushing.

Title: I have a strange, irrational fear anxiety of weather phenomenon. And I do not understand why.
Thread
Saying it is irrational is an understatement it completely delusional at times, and it is frustrating me as much as it is worrying me it of weather any kind it scares the hell out of me any time I think about it, I think about rainstorms, thunderstorms, tornados, hurricanes supercell they are invasive thoughts that will not leave me alone. I do not even live in an area where dangerous weather occurs. If I am outside and a cloud is over me, I get irrationally uncomfortable and usually go back inside it even worse if there is any kind of wind that brushes me what more ridiculous is if I am doing something like taking a shower, I will get invasive thoughts about storms and such, and it can cause me to panic enough to stop the shower midway through. What confuses me is that I love weather. I find it fascinating and amazing. I want to stand out in the rain. I want the wind to blow against me. Hell. Being a storm chaser was a dream of mine at some point. And as long as there is someone with me when it is windy or raining, I will not feel any fear whatsoever. But the second I am alone. It scares me whether I am exposed to it or not just last night before going to sleep, I ended up seeing a picture of a lightning bolt in a storm in a video, and it stuck with me. My heart was racing. I wasScrunching up my body. My breathing started getting quick and erratic. It was like a panic attack. I do not understand why weather freaks me out so much, and I wish the fears would just fuck off.

I have literally no advice except to try and occupy yourself although I am currently sat here myself with the blinds closed and volume up on the to in hope I can drown out the noise of the storm outside it not really working right now and the anxiety has kicked in.

I do not understand why I have such bad social anxiety. I feel like I do not fit the description for someone dealing with something like this. I am semi popular at school, have my small group of friends play sports, and I am in great physical shape. I feel like people would not think someone like me is dealing with so much internally. This is so fucked. I cannot talk to people that I am not close with, especially girls. My mind goes completely blank and my face gets red and I start sweating. I am able to fake it til I make it to a degree. But this is mentally draining, and I am afraid to be myself. I have always had horrible general anxiety and shyness in general, stemming from my tourette's. I see the doctor monday to ask about anxiety meds.

This sounds very familiar whenever I tell people about it, they go you no way. We all fake it till we make it. Youre taking a step in the right direction, though, hope you get some answers or something to help you along.

And when I actually started to consider getting help with it had a doctors visit today, just a regular well visit and told her how I have been feeling made it the whole appointment without crying. I was shaking like crazy. And I am surprised she did not say anything about my abnormally high heart rate. It was literally at confusion. But she listened to my problems and suggested medication tomorrow I start lexapro, hoping it is a step in the right direction. I am weary to talk to a therapist. I have trouble communicating how I am feeling and I have trust issuesconfusion, but I hope medication will bring my anxiety down enough to where I feel okay to talk to someone and dive deep into why I feel the way I do. Its been a long years fighting with my own brain. I am hoping for some quietness.

Thats great congrats that brings back memories of when I first talked to my doctor. Blood pressure is through the roof. When I go just something to think about from past experience with meds. Sometimes they make things better, but it never really fixed or helped me get through my problems. It just maybe dumbed them down a bit. I think you should truly consider therapy if you want to get to the bottom of it.

Im not okay like, seriously what the is wrong with me? I need help. I take meds I go to therapy, im working on self improvement im like im literally crazy. I feel I cannot even think straight I have been having so much anxiety every night I want to. So I am days sober from it, or at least I was but then I cut tonight I want to kill myself. I feel like im dying. I struggle to breathe all day, and sometimes it gets worse to where I feel like im suffocating and I imagine weird things when I close my eyes and ive been dissociating so much and I even started fainting and ink what else I cannot think? But it is all worsened in the past few weeks ink how much longer I can take it? Im scared and I do not like it, and it is ruining my relationship, fucking hate myself. I hate how I feel im dying. Im so sad I cry for hours, awful

Please try this breathing technique, two sharp inhales through the nose and a long exhale through the mouth. Repeat for a few minutes. This is the bodies natural way of calming itself down, calm body, calm mind. Are you seeing anybody about these feelings? You have been having no sense. I am suffering alone when there are people that can and want to help you. Theres nothing wrong with asking for help.

Title: Anxiety attack and I am all by myself.
Thread
My boyfriend is home all the time, but he left today for a four day trip for coaching, and it just happens. I am extremely anxious. A few years ago, I got this super sharp pain in my skulls for a couple seconds, and I thought I was going to die now every time I get a slight, sharp pain in my neck or a feeling like a head ache coming on but does not turn into one. I get anxious that I am dying, it sucks being home alone when this happens, and I just feel scared in disappointed face.

In all seriousness, the body will let you know if something is wrong, and if you are worried about dying, it usually is not with pains in the head or neck. So you are fine. Flip on a movie and have some ice cream. Yum.

Title: Currently grappling with a period of on and off high anxiety from existential dread, trying to see if this is normal, get some advice.
Thread
I have been struggling with intense existential dread dealing mortalityconfusion in the last two days im assuming as part of an anxiety episodeconfusion but the feelings have been uncontrollable as well as uncomfortable as they are being accompanied by some really intense and bad intrusive thoughts I do take and use xanax but my prescription is near running out so I am trying to avoid taking it unless I feel I absolutely cannot handle my thoughts because it is likely I will not be able to get a refill until early next week has anyone else had this experience and maybe have tips for ways to calm myself down without xanax
Comments
Existential dread is the absolute worst. You are not alone in this. My best piece of advice is to do everything in your power, to try to distract yourself with other things. When the anxiety gets really bad, talking to people playing video games, watching movies, reading a book, listening to music, etc. Its not a foolproof solution, but dwelling on it is just going to make things worse.

Title: I am paralyzed by my anxiety, and I do not know how to stop.
Thread
I just spent two years working on something I believed to be a good investment of my time I started it during the pandemic because I did not think paying year was worth it for the glorified youtube my classes had become during year I only took a few classes to give myself time for it I worked on it almost every waking moment because any time I stopped it felt like I was ruining my entire life my average time spent asleep was probably hours I rarely did anything except work on it turns out it was a fucking waste I might as well have spent the time high and drunk as fuck for all the good it did at least then I would have friends and a few interesting or pleasant memories I was stupid to have ever believed I could do things differently and started it. And it is by far the biggest regret of my life as a result of having royally fucked myself. I am incapable of making a decision or acting to better my future. I know I need to go back to school, but I cannot even bring myself to fill out my fafsa. It feels like every choice I make is going to be the wrong one I will pick the wrong major and spend my life in debt and jobless. I will go back and fail my classes because it has been so long I will choose a trade instead and end up killing myself in years.Because I would hate it literally anything. Amp how can I make this stop? I cannot get therapy. I do not have insurance and do not even make enough to afford the copy. If I did all other suggestions, welcome, just please do not just tell me how much of a fucking idiot I am. I already know. I fucked myself and my life up. I just want to know what to do now.

Follow gary vaynerchuck on insta and youtube very helpful for putting things into perspective about making decisions. I have been watching him for a few years, and I am in love with how much he helps. People of all ages reframe their situation and take action. I suggest feeding your brain with helpful books, videos, content and keep reaching out to people. Do you have anyone you know who you look up to? Mentor you? Unfortunately, I do not think anyone can give you a magic answer for this. Its going to be best to approach this from multiple directions. Get organized clear, your head, absorb knowledge and write what you would like to do and what you need to accomplish that set some goals, even if you do not stick to them, the process may result in some epiphanies. Youre not alone. Plenty of people do not know what the to do. I am going through it again after being pretty happy with a situation, but smile and enjoy the ride.

Title: Prozac.
Thread
Hey, yall! My doctor prescribed me prozac my a day and told me to take it in the morning. I only really suffer with gad. Todays my first day, starting it. I recently tried buspar, but it gave me the worst insomnia imaginable, and I already struggle with sleep issues. I heard it takes getting used to. So I am prepared to stick out and try it for at least weeks. I also am a frequent cannabis user, and was not sure if the prozac would interact with it in any way, just wondering if anyone has any success. Stories, advice or stories of side affects with prozac.
Comments
Prozac worked really well for me my main symptoms when getting on it was headaches and super weird dreams that went away pretty quick and I felt it helping anxiety a lot after the first month or so I went off once I was feeling better but will probably get back on soon as anxiety has increased a lot again

I totally go through this too. The good thing is, every time it does, come to an end, which is always a relief to look forward, too, of course, deep breathing helps a lot to lower your heart rate and calm yourself. But I would encourage you to also try using physical touch to help while it is going on. My therapist suggested it to me a while back, and it is helped confusion. For example, maybe you have a pet, a fuzzy blanket, even things like a stress ball while you are having your anxiety, sit down with your item and play with it touch. It also try to think about the acronym stop. Literally is stop. Take in your surroundings, use your item access, your overall situation, pause and reassure yourself. I know it may sound like mumbo, jumbo, but it is helped me

Thats wonderful. Just remember if lexapro is not working for you for any reason, let the doctor know there are other drugs to try. I had to go thru a few to find the right one.

Its very common. Actually it could be emotional burnout or maybe your stamina has lowered. If you have not kept a routine for physical activity, I was at a low point as well, where I would feel worn out from just sitting at the computer for minutes. Try taking it easy and doing simple things like reading a book or going for a walk. Also, while your exercising music can really help or an audiobook to get your mind off things hope you feel better soon.

Valium has always instantly calmed me down, never had any side effects except for drowsiness, but it makes you feel so peaceful. Don worry about taking it. And my is a very small amount, just be careful not to get addicted, because it is pretty addictive, but you probably will not have to worry about that unless you start depending on it. I have bad health anxiety too, and I had no problems taking two my valium daily for a couple of days. It really helped a lot to get my brain to just relax, enjoy your valium.

Valium is great. Ive taken a high dose of it and did not have any side effects. It will not make you high at all. You will not feel any side effects from it at all. The only thing you will feel is you will feel normal.

I was very scared and I went to the hospital. I was very scared and did not want to take any. I ended up taking it cause they said, if I do not take it, I cannot go home. I took it and it calmed me right down. The next day, I got more from the doctors, you will be okay. I just took some, it helps me stop hyperventilating.

Title: Crowds and drums my two least favorite things.
Thread
Alright, so we had some thing called a school assembly meeting today. Basically, the whole school goes in one room and the band plays. Clubs, do things, and the principle talks about stuff or something like that. I did not stay longconfusion. I had planned to skip out before it started. But some teachers told me I had to go, and I figured I would get around the same time wether. I walked the miles in the cold snow or sat through the thing and rode the bus. So I went, I got in and my hart was already racing. I say, down, not notice where I was sitting and ended up sitting next to someone who told me to fuck off and move, because he was saving that seat anyways. I got up and walked right out the door as I was already starting to hyperventilate. So I stood in the hall for awhile, trying to calm down, when I decided I could not do this and started for the exit, that when a teacher saw me and yelled at me to go back. Note, I was wearing a mask, so she probably could not see that I was distressed or hyperventilatingconfusion. And for some dumb reason, I listened and started back by the time I got to the entrance to the gym, the drums were play, and that is when I started hyperventilating, really bad I hate drums. I guess you could call them my nails on a chalkboard. The noise pierces through myEars and bounces around in my head, and my hart just mistakes the sound of the drums for the rythm. It is supposed to follow and your sex and age beating heavy and fast. I once again tried calming myself down, but the drums made it impossible. And next thing I knew I was outside covers in snow about mile away from my house, ink just wanted to write this down. I feel pretty pathetic afterwards. I mean, I am. I feel like things like this should not bother me.

Im sorry you had to go through that. It sounds like a shitty day indeed, you cant help what you feel. Your feelings are always real and important. If you have a sensitivity for certain sounds, I would recomend loop earplugs or similar brands. They dont filter out speech, but just loud noises. Please be kind to yourself. Op it sounds like you have social anxiety, and its completely understandable at your age when some people act like complete asshats.

Hi. I am female, and I am happily married with a beautiful baby boy. I have been struggling mentally for years, and I am at a point where I cannot over come my brain. I am a stay at home, mom, and do of house work and care by my self. As my husband is a blue collar man and works long hours, I am happy to take care of the house, so I am able to stay home with our son confusion. I am looking for a hobby or something to do, because I really do not do anything besides care for everyone. I have tried a lot of different crafting things gardening, skiing, snowboarding, gaming, gardening, painting, reading, writing, shooting targets, shopping, and none I seem to enjoy or be remotely good at to keep doing, which depresses me and makes me feel hopeless, because I have nothing to do or succeed at. I am also struggling with body image issues, where I am comparing my self to other females and their skinny, flawless bodies. I am labs, and I do not see a lot of fat on my body, but I am very stripped from birth. I have some chunk that hangs over my waist, and I am not proud of it. I have even tried working out intensely since my son was born, and I have not lost any weight, even with healthy eating and dieting. My son is also a baby that was born month early, and I am struggling withBeing jealous of moms who had full term pregnancies and their babies are born the same time as my boy who are succeeding at things my boy cannot do yet I get really defensive when people tell me he should be doing and he is not yet which I feel like I should be angry they are comparing my child butt I secretly am to in the back of my head because I am worried he will be behind for a while. If any one has any advice, I am happy to listen. Thank you red heart.

I am sorry you are going through this and you are not alone. I would suggest doing something you love and see if you can find something similar at home as for your body. It takes time, bo matter what todays society. It is give birth, instant, loose weight and go to work. But that is not practical. As for your baby boy, I was born months premature. I was delayed at first, but picked up when I went to school. Although I was in special education, I proudly graduated with a high school diploma. I do not want to over step and say something offensive, but it really helped when someone usually my mom sat down helped me understand, and it I hope you are well. If you ever want to chat, do me no pressureconfusion

Title: I am feeling extremely jittery and I am growing more anxious about it.
Thread
I am feeling extremely jittery and shaky. I cannot sit still, and it is as if I am super excited, but I am not. I am starting to feel anxious about it. This happens to me every once in a while. It fun at first, but then I start to feel overwhelmed. I just danced for about mins now about to go outside and walk my dog to see if that calms me. Does this ever happen to anyone else? What do you do to soothe yourself?

For me personally, I always have experienced anxiety in relation to academics or work. I always start overthinking and becoming restless. What I have found to work is to take deep, long breathes and just focus on that. I also try to put things into perspective as to what really is that causes me to feel this way. I fear of being judged, because I do not perform well. Maybe see if this jittery behaviour happens in relation into anything. Alternatively, you can also try always going for a walk around the block as soon as these habits occur. Let me know if any of this helps

Title: I am mentally shattered and yet I am still struggling to fall asleep now getting headaches aswell.
Thread
For the last week, I have been struggling to fall asleep. I do struggle in general to sleep anyways, like I am sure many others do on this community page. But this last week has been a nightmare. I am anxious. Aswell constantly biting my nails due to the lack of sleep, and now it is getting on top of me, I think last night I got hours sleep. I cannot be me. I deal with my anxiety pretty well with exercise and doing odds sods to keep me busy. But my energy lately is lacking. I do normally have some chamomile tea before bed. As I have read, that is supposed to help aswell as a humidifier that pumps out lavender oil for an hour before bed. Or I read with some lo fi music on, which helps me chill out before going bed. I have been trying to get my sleep at am, but I have been awake till or am which sucks, trying to get myself up for. Am every morning to no hope, trying to reconfigure my sleep layout. So I can get some early morning exercise in. As I hate exercising in public places, when people are around in the day, always feel like I am being judged. If I do, I do have a power nap around. Am for hour to try and catch up with my lack of energy hope everyone is doing ok. Anyways, much love. I am just looking for some suggestions on what you do toHelp being sleep deprived would be greatly appreciated raising hands

Personally I found chamomile tea refreshes more than it relaxes only thing that helps me sleep is a clear mind usual I put on some sleep meditation video they are something you can focus on without being overly stimulated

I just want to start by saying that there will be no nuclear war. I know this because all the world leaders know that once one nuke is launched, the offending country would be decimated it a lose situation, as long as the leader is not completely unhinged. See, kim jung un as most likely culpritconfusion or by accident, there will be no nuclear war. Countries only have nukes as a threat to the other countries that have them not only do nukes kill many people but destroy the land, making its resources unavailable and the area uninhabitable for generations, and the effects spread rapidly around the world, poisoning everyone. They know this. That is why it will never happen. I am a worrier, and nuclear war is at the very bottom of my worry list. It also something that we, the average personconfusion, have no control over and cannot really prepare for. So not worth the brain energy stress

First of all, try to remind yourself that most likely nothing will happen, and you are just catastrophizing. I know because I do the same using past experiences where things did not turn out as bad as you were thinking can help with disputing these thoughts. Then remember that all this is completely out of your control. What is going to happen will happen and there is nothing you can do about it. What you can do is turn off then to and take a break from social media. Try focusing on yourself for some time. Not keeping up with the news for a while is not going to change anything. Anyway. Finally, no matter what happens, you will deal with it. If and when it happens, you live in the present, not in the future.

Key is not to try and fight it or resist it. Notice the feeling take an object like a phone keys or water bottle and pass it between your hands for a minute or two. Crossing the midline of your body, it will calm things down. Technical term for this is bilateral stimulation.

Crocheting helped me. I can do it anywhere. It keeps my fingers busy is surprisingly meditative and a totally normal activity. If I felt the twinges of anxiety and self harm creeping up, I would try to head it off. If you have insurance and do not have a therapist, I would check to see what your co pay is new law under biden makes mental health co pay much more affordable.

Propranolol is a super safe drug. Maybe take that one first for one day and see how it feels. It can make you a little dizzy. In the beginning for me, it just gets rid of nervous, shakes, sweats and heart palpitations. I take my as needed started at. I love that.

Well, its not healthy to pretend that youre happy if you are not to smile at other people, though, can be a nice social gesture, to some extent, I would say that it sounds a bit like you might have an underlying depression, though it might be worth to read up on.

Title: Is it valid possible to indentify as a nonhuman?
Thread
Greetings. I am a nineteen years old, gender person. I had surgery back in november that completly removed my genitals, allowing for my body to be basically comealplty, gender neutral. I ve been enjoying living like this a lot. I feel fully blank, and finally, comfortably living as myselfconfusion and a major feeling I have had since my surgery is how inhuman I am as a genderless human. I have always realaetd a lot to robots in fiction because of both my lack of gender and my neurodivergence, I tended to feel a lot more like robots or cyborgs in fiction. Then I did most humanoid characters, and I always kind of had an aversion to nature. Parks scare me, and I will start weeping or panicking if I am outside a densely populated urban area, I just feel very disconnected to humans. I really like spending time with most humans, but it always feels like I am very diffrent from all of them. Then again, this may just be the fact that the majority of humans are cis and nurotypical even more, then that I just do not like having flesh, like I do not feel like this body is mine. This feeling was a lot stronger when I had genitals, but still, it feels like I want to replace my limbs and organs, and especially my skin with machinery. I just do not want to be a biological person. Is it valid to indentify as a machine or cyborg? When I was younger, iUsed to laugh at otherkin and think of them as transphobic. But now I really feel like my identity might not be a humanoid one. I might also have to give up libido soon as it is hard to orgasm. Not that I am nice and smooth downstairs. So putting myself of drugs that remove my sex drive is a possiblity. Also, those drugs may help with anxietyconfusion. The idea of not feeling those things is kind of horrifying to me, but also kind of nice. And importantly, for this situation, it would make me feel even more like a robot, especially with how my of would be allowed to use me. If I did do it, would it be valid for me to call myself machinekin, or something of that sort, or is this a not mentally healthy thing? When I told my cishetconfusion of about wanting to be nonhuman, she, though I was suicidal, I not suicidalconfusion would indeifying as inhuman, be valid. And if I do identify as such, what can I do to make myself feel look less human?
Comments
In my experience, anyone identifies as anything I have seen people identify as robotic. I have even seen robotic neopronouns. You are definitely not alone. It is worrying that feel so extremely bothered from humanity that this is what you are thinking about. It does come across as suicidal. I am not in your head, nor am I anything close to a therapist. Your genital removal seems so extreme to me. I am very curious about how that functions and what the long term effects are that not my buisness, though I do hope this came across as neutral. I do not mean to give hate here

Title: Does anyone elses nervous system and eyes feel overstimulated like this all the time?
Thread
So I have had anxiety for ish years now I have had my ups and downs. But the one thing that is really tough for me is to function like a normal human cause. I feel so overstimulated all the time. For example, I have this spot in front of my eyes that is always there. Its like a migraine aura. I have been to doctors for this and had mris legs and eye exams. No one can find anything. And I was told this could be caused by anxiety and stress, and they call it visual snow syndrome, or a persistent migraine auraconfusion. But whenever something is too bright, too dark or when I see a busy pattern, it is just too much for my brain to process, it always makes me feel like I need to lay down and sleep. Most jobs nowadays acquire some type of digital work and staring at a screen for a long time just makes me unable to function the days after. But a lot of social contact causes the same. It feels like my thoughts and eyes go too fast for my head, even being with friends. A few evenings in a row does this for me. I feel like I need to recharge myself after I can feel lightheaded or have brain fog the day after, and it is not only cause of the spot in front of my eyes bow, it also just feels like my nervous system is on high alert, and I cannot seemTo slow it down, especially the way I see everything. It feels like too much for my brain at times to just live like everyone else. My resting, he is also always higher than normal, and I am struggling with relaxing. Because of all this. I am nervous a few days in advance, when an event is coming up, whether it is a job interview, a normal workday, a trip somewhere, or even just seeing my friends. I just keep the cycle of anxiety going. I had it under control for a while, but it keeps coming back. It makes my head exhausted to live in fear like this all the time. Its almost like I create the worst case scenarios for myself every time. I mean, that is kind of what anxiety isconfusion. I am so scared. Il never be able to function like a normal adult. Does anyone else have this and did anything work for you to get rid of this? I have been looking into neurofeedback, but I just feel so hopeless, would love to hear some similar experiences.

I have had fairly severe anxiety going on about years now at first it was not too bad just kind of not liking the spotlight but now if the conditions are right I cannot even stand being in a room full of people it does have its ups and downs sometimes for no reason but I have narrowed it down to what triggers it and try to limit my exposure to those situations some are inevitable and I know my anxiety around them is irrational so I do those activities anyway I usually do not do well after them but I always come out alive have you tried breathing techniques to relax the body? Its impossible to relax the mind with the mind so you should start with the body also just to throw this out there as something I have experienced when I was in college I used to take a supplement for lifting that really helped with everything its banned now sadnessconfusion but when I took it, I almost found it impossible to focus on myself, and I would only focus on the task at hand or other people. I had no symptoms of anxiety or nervousness, and I loved it. Thats literally the root of all this. You are focusing on yourself too much and I get it is really hard not to. I still deal with severe anxiety in certain situations, but knowing how to fix it can help shed some light on possibly mitigating it. If you are feeling anxious, justSay, fuck it! And try real hard to focus on something else for a little. If you really try it, youl find your symptoms go away even for a second. Its interesting when you trip over something that works. But the key is consistency.

Take two inhales through the nose and a deep exhale through the mouth. Do this for a few minutes, and your body should calm down a little. It is the natural way your body calms itself. Ever see a little kid cry after awhile, they do this sniff when breathing in. Its the phrenic nerve linked directly to the diaphragm to help calm the body.

Aside from this feeling, are you otherwise in good health, seek care if you really need it otherwise? I use to feel like this. Your brain thinks there is a threat but does not know what it is. So it is spiraling. Find a good therapist, preferably one that focuses on cognitive behavioral therapy. Thought stopping was a game changer for me.

Its kind of hard to explain, but I feel frantic and like stress is piling up behind the scenes of my facade, I also have this pit of discomfort, not really painconfusion in my belly, which I recall feeling after the other panic attacks in case I am about to have one. Is there any way I can stop it before I do thanks.

Avoid caffeine or anything that will elevate your heart rate. Often, your brain will see the physical signs and cause the mental ones. Just relax, breathe deeply and find something to relax with.

Hi, have you tried icing your vagus nerve, grab an ice pack and put it right on your sternum for maybe five minutes? I get similar results from submerging my face in ice water. It may not work for everyone, but it works for me fast way of grounding myself back into the moment. Good luck.

Take some time out. If you can focus on breathing, listen to a meditation or nature. Sounds, sit or lie down. Dont try to prevent any physical sensations, but try to rest in awareness truly hope you feel yourself again soon.

Title: Is it valid possible to indentify as a nonhuman?
Thread
Greetings. I am a nineteen years old, gender person. I had surgery back in november that completly removed my genitals, allowing for my body to be basically comealplty, gender neutral. I ve been enjoying living like this a lot. I feel fully blank, and finally, comfortably living as myselfconfusion and a major feeling I have had since my surgery is how inhuman I am as a genderless human. I have always realaetd a lot to robots in fiction because of both my lack of gender and my neurodivergence, I tended to feel a lot more like robots or cyborgs in fiction. Then I did most humanoid characters, and I always kind of had an aversion to nature. Parks scare me, and I will start weeping or panicking if I am outside a densely populated urban area, I just feel very disconnected to humans. I really like spending time with most humans, but it always feels like I am very diffrent from all of them. Then again, this may just be the fact that the majority of humans are cis and nurotypical even more, then that I just do not like having flesh, like I do not feel like this body is mine. This feeling was a lot stronger when I had genitals, but still, it feels like I want to replace my limbs and organs, and especially my skin with machinery. I just do not want to be a biological person. Is it valid to indentify as a machine or cyborg? When I was younger, iUsed to laugh at otherkin and think of them as transphobic. But now I really feel like my identity might not be a humanoid one. I might also have to give up libido soon as it is hard to orgasm. Not that I am nice and smooth downstairs. So putting myself of drugs that remove my sex drive is a possiblity. Also, those drugs may help with anxietyconfusion. The idea of not feeling those things is kind of horrifying to me, but also kind of nice. And importantly, for this situation, it would make me feel even more like a robot, especially with how my of would be allowed to use me. If I did do it, would it be valid for me to call myself machinekin, or something of that sort, or is this a not mentally healthy thing? When I told my cishetconfusion of about wanting to be nonhuman, she, though I was suicidal, I not suicidalconfusion would indeifying as inhuman, be valid. And if I do identify as such, what can I do to make myself feel look less human?

Title: How to calm down without self harm involved.
Thread
So I developed this pattern of self harming, when my anxiety is really bad, and I cannot think calmly, but I know it is quite problematic behavior. So I am trying to end it. I figured out going into a shower, in my clothes and showering in cold water helps a lot, but I cannot always do that. The water makes me laugh my ass out, and I live in a shared flat and do not want to make my flatmates think I am crazyconfusion. Shouting also helps, but it has the same problem. I am afraid people will think I am a psycho. I know it is a negative word, but I am afraid that someone will perceive me as thatconfusion. How do you cope with your anxiety without harming yourself

I use really cold water. I will fill a sink and just play with it for a bit.

I just want to start by saying that there will be no nuclear war. I know this because all the world leaders know that once one nuke is launched, the offending country would be decimated it a lose situation, as long as the leader is not completely unhinged. See, kim jung un as most likely culpritconfusion or by accident, there will be no nuclear war. Countries only have nukes as a threat to the other countries that have them not only do nukes kill many people but destroy the land, making its resources unavailable and the area uninhabitable for generations, and the effects spread rapidly around the world, poisoning everyone. They know this. That is why it will never happen. I am a worrier, and nuclear war is at the very bottom of my worry list. It also something that we, the average personconfusion, have no control over and cannot really prepare for. So not worth the brain energy stress

Not a food, but ice water can be somewhat soothing. Grapes and unsweetened applesauce are also my go tos, but more so because they are easy to eat when I am not feeling well. I have never tried this for anxiety, but I imagine sucking on a peppermint might help too. Peppermint is supposed to relax, soothe your stomach and throat muscles, and the taste might help ground you. We used to get them before taking the sats when I was a kid, not sure if it actually helped, but I also was not nearly as anxious back then either.

I would say, whatever your body is craving. I think it is healthy to follow your cravings so long as they are. Just that cravings not habits, which people try to excuse as cravings. Thirsty for water. You are body probably needs hydrating. Hungry for steak, your body probably needs protein. Wanting salty popcorn. Your body probably needs sodium.

Title: Am I having anxiety attacks?
Thread
I have always been an incredibly anxious person, but I have never been officially diagnosed with anything, and I have always kind of brushed it off and justified it by telling myself that is just how everyone feels, I guess, however, I recently started having what I think could be anxiety attacks. The attacks are never triggered by anything in particular, and I am not going through anything stressful at the moment. So could anyone help me confirm that what I am experiencing might actually be what I think it is. The best way I can describe the attacks is that it feels like my brain is screaming at me. Everything I think starts to get amplified and almost distorted, as if my inner voice is yelling at me. Then the thoughts start to loop around and around, getting faster and louder and more and more overwhelming until it feels like my head is going to explode. Now that I am putting it into words, I feel like my suspicions might be correct, but I am still unsure. Does this sound familiar to anyone who knows what an anxiety attack feels like. Am I just overreacting? I feel like I am going crazy?

Title: Whats the best antidepressant?
Thread
I have been on antidepressants constantly for around years, following a breakdown where I was diagnosed with bad and panic disorder. I have yet to find an antidepressant that solves the anxiety and panic, and I have been on all sorts. I am currently on agomelatine, pregabalin, diazepam, as and when needed, the pregabalin does nothing for anxiety, but I am on a relatively low dose of my a day. I have been taking the agomelatine for a month, and the anxiety is killing me, but my doctor will not change it until they have spoken to my psychiatrist, which will take weeks. I have been on trazodone, mirtazapine venlafaxine, duloxetine prozac agomelatine. I had the best results from trazodone, but I could not deal with the sedation any more, and it stopped working as well. After a year, venlafaxine and duloxetine were unbearable, and I could not handle the side effects, so was not on them long. What antidepressant have people had the best experience with that is really helped your anxiety. Panic I am more anxious than depressed, and it can get very severe to the point. I feel like I am going to die and I am losing control. I am need some ideas to suggest to my psychiatrist, bow I am in the uk. So not sure if the medications I have mentioned are under the same names in the us. Thanks.

First of all, try to remind yourself that most likely nothing will happen, and you are just catastrophizing. I know because I do the same using past experiences where things did not turn out as bad as you were thinking can help with disputing these thoughts. Then remember that all this is completely out of your control. What is going to happen will happen and there is nothing you can do about it. What you can do is turn off then to and take a break from social media. Try focusing on yourself for some time. Not keeping up with the news for a while is not going to change anything. Anyway. Finally, no matter what happens, you will deal with it. If and when it happens, you live in the present, not in the future.

Anxiety is a bitch. Sometimes, education causes new symptoms. My left arm hurts sometimes similarly, I never had shakes or asked for benzos when I have had alcohol related ailments and had to stop. But then I learned about withdrawal dangers and guess who developed crippling anxiety and shakes and demands librium if they have relapsed with drinks kind of like the weakness on one side or the other after my grandmother had a stroke. Anxiety is ridiculous.

For some reason I am nervous around british people in dating. I am okay around asians and less shallow cultures as I feel, they are more serious and less likely to reject me. It just ruins all my relationships. But I must admit that I have also noticed a difference in conversation with british people. I. They play more mind games. They may message you first, but then they will start to drift of and lie about their intentions. I do not get it. Maybe I am very ill in that sense, but I am not a racist. It is just how I feel. Perhaps it is my age, though at, and it will improve

I am british and do not do this. I am actually trying to talk to a latino guy online and he is doing the thing you mentioned never messages me unless I do first and does not say very much.

For reference, I generally start of well, but when they start ignoring me or saying things like, I will call you and then do not without an explanation. It bugs me. The only time they do explain is when you get annoyed and that leads to a blocking. With other races, this does not happen, and they are more understanding towards my anxiety. Maybe I am just not attractive enough to british people to get away with it.

Title: Blood pressure, anxiety.
Thread
Can anyone assure me that is not going to kill me any second I am? I ve had blood pressure issues since I was in my early. I have been taking valsartan, my and metoprolol my daily, for the past weeks, been taking valsartan and metoprolol since my early, but just recently upped the dose of valsartan to try and get the blood pressure downconfusion after battling high blood pressure issues for the last six months. I have been to the doctor many times. I ve been to the er room. I have seen nurse practitioners when my regular doc was not available. I am sick of worrying every second. I am sure this blood pressure has gotten out of control again, but there is nothing I can do to get this number down right now. I am on the cuff. I have at home at least hours out of the day, waiting for a good number. I have drinking problems, but I am trying to stop. It has been a good while where I have been sober for longer than days. So I am sure that is not helping anyway, please, someone help me calm down a little. Thank you.

Yeah, just know you are not alone. So many helpful people here trust me, I am not perfect. I still struggle with anxiety, but I am really focusing on life is to damn short, we got to live it. And as crazy as things are, there is so much more than being beat up with stress and anxiety. I can promise. If I can make this better, you can as well. You ve got to be strong and almost get pissed off and stop letting this crap dictate who you are. Let that anger push you to be who you are meant to be.

Lowering your blood pressure is good to do. But worrying about your blood pressure hour by hour is pointless and does nothing but worry you. The actions you can take to lower your blood pressure are longer term, and changes can take longer than weeks.

Title: Whats the best antidepressant?
Thread
I have been on antidepressants constantly for around years, following a breakdown where I was diagnosed with bad and panic disorder. I have yet to find an antidepressant that solves the anxiety and panic, and I have been on all sorts. I am currently on agomelatine, pregabalin, diazepam, as and when needed, the pregabalin does nothing for anxiety, but I am on a relatively low dose of my a day. I have been taking the agomelatine for a month, and the anxiety is killing me, but my doctor will not change it until they have spoken to my psychiatrist, which will take weeks. I have been on trazodone, mirtazapine venlafaxine, duloxetine prozac agomelatine. I had the best results from trazodone, but I could not deal with the sedation any more, and it stopped working as well. After a year, venlafaxine and duloxetine were unbearable, and I could not handle the side effects, so was not on them long. What antidepressant have people had the best experience with that is really helped your anxiety. Panic I am more anxious than depressed, and it can get very severe to the point. I feel like I am going to die and I am losing control. I am need some ideas to suggest to my psychiatrist, bow I am in the uk. So not sure if the medications I have mentioned are under the same names in the us. Thanks.

You should not be taking any antidepressant they do not do anything placeboconfusion and cause horrific side effects like sexual dysfunction and extreme weight gain in some people, the sexual dysfunction is permanent pssdconfusion and has been recognized as a legitimate condition caused by sis. In europe I would look at psychedelic treatments. They are far more effective and not as dangerous. They will replace antidepressants in years and antidepressants will be outlawed within. I would bet on it its disturbing how many people think antidepressants are safe drugs.

Ambien, but would not recommend because it is addicting.

Title: Prozac side effects.
Thread
I have been on prozac started off with mgconfusion for four days, just got prescribed it for anxiety, and the huge list of side effects have spooked me. I have been getting headaches for the past few days, to be fair, those started the day before I got prescribed the prozacconfusion. And since yesterday, I have had this weird feeling in my head, like my brain is fuzzy. It kind of a tickling feeling behind my eyes and in the side of my head I feel pretty hazy aswell are these normal side effects to be having so early on it freaking me out a little and triggering my anxiety. Anybody else have that kind of thing, like a weird feeling in the brain. It could just be from the month long build up of stress or normal side effects, or a mixture of both just feeling pretty weird

Title: Does anyone else hate when employers want you to put your number on a contact sheet?
Thread
I honestly hate having to either let them put my number on a employee contact sheet or feel like a jerk for making a thing out of it and telling them, no it, my number. I pay the bill. It is not a business phone. I do not want some random people I barely know calling, texting me when they want a shift covered. I have had people call me in the middle of the night to ask me to cover a shift, days after people say, well, then turn your volume down. No, it is my phone. And if for some reason, someone friends or family coworker needing a shift covered is not a emergencyconfusion needs to get ahold of me in a emergency. I leave the volume up. Why should I have to change my way of doing things? I have also had people joke that they were going to give someone my number. I had someone I worked with briefly end up borderline stalking me on and off for a couple years, and I am sure if she had access to my number, I would have had to have it changed. So no, I do not want my number given out. Is it weird? Anyone else like this

Google voice number route it to your main number if you want, but you can also turn it off. Silence it at any time.

I agree it is such a violation you can choose which coworkers you are comfortable with. Having your number on your own. Sometimes being on a contact sheet just opens up a whole world of problems, especially if you are not even open to picking up shifts and do not typically need yours covered.

I do this as well. A therapist taught me to imagine all the worries as little versions of me sat around a boardroom style table with actual me at the head of the table and to imagine going around the table, thanking my brain for its contributions and being like, thanks very much for worrying and caring for me. I have decided on this route. It has really helped a lot.

I do somewhat the same when I was in rehab. I learned that fear initially is a good thing, and it is supposed to warn us to be careful. Yes, that fear can get out of hand, which we all struggle with in here. So just imagine your anxiety as a small, cute creature that is trying to help by telling you to be careful. Instead, mine is a small, fluffy monster, and whenever I am anxious in situations where I know it is irrational, I thank it for looking out for me and make sure to reassure it that were safe and it can relax helped me a ton honestly. I also integrate that in new conversations with new people. I introduce my monster to the people I learn to know. Instead of worrying, what if my anxiety fucks everything up working with it is always easier than working against it. Acceptance helps a bunch

When it starts, I am not caught in a thought spiral, just blank. No triggering events. I go from irritable and dont know why. Well, fed warm enough body okayconfusion to pounding, radiating chest pain to numb and unmovable limbs in a matter of minutes, I feel out of body, I cannot think at all. I cannot move. I get the dim idea that I was told to take a pill for this, but it is three feet away, and I cannot reach it. My mouth will not move. I cannot call for help. I have recently been for a full cardiac work up. Stress test, sonogram, it scan all of it aside from diffuse wave, somethings on the ekg that doc says are very common and not a sign of any disease state, whatever everything is fine. And the pain is absolutely not cardiac, but it still hurts. Its also not reflux or gas, nor do I have any injury to my ribs. A few tiny lung nodules from couid, most likely. But oxygen has been fine throughout I have had classic style, panic attacks recently, too. Fatigue shakes and confusion out of nowhere. I guess I was just wondering how anxiety could be like this with no thoughts, only physical ink, how to even begin to address it. My psych doc says to only take the anxiety meds as needed, but waiting until they are needed makes it hard to take them at all. If I can pull myself out of it long enough.To open a bottle have not I passed. The worst of it has anyone else had this

Hi, friend, I am sorry you are going through a tough moment. School can be very stressful, so you need to take some time to relax and debrief. I know that the way society is structured pressures every young people to go to college right away but do not lose your mind about it. Take things slowly. We think we have to be successful at a certain age, but there is a time for anything. Life is a vapor. Appreciate the good moments and the people you have in your life. Take things slowly at school. Things will be ok. You need to be in good health. If you want to finish school and go to college, wish you well,

Of the time I wake up so anxious. It is hard or impossible to get out of bed and get ready for work. I like my job. I am not anxious about work, I do not think.

I saw some youtube videos about morning anxiety. Specifically, they said it usually is because you fall asleep with stressful thoughts, and that the body literally stores the anxiety while sleeping and lets it out the moment you wake up. If you search for morning anxiety, you will find them. I think that one of the solutions was to calm your mind before sleep.

I relate to this these are my mornings too I usually turn on a guided meditation or will use some binaural beats for anxiety and focus on my breath until things start to settle I may take an theanine or kava capsule if it is still difficult after that you re not alone smiling face with open hands

Gratitude. I have a preset list of topics I go through according to category, large, sweeping things like being born in the internet age, all the way to specifics, friends, family gadgets and technology. I have access to primal needs that are met experiences I have had, etc. There ve been times where I kept it short and sweet and just listed out things I was grateful for yesterday and things I am grateful for coming up today, or I will list out as many things I can think of to be grateful for in this present moment shelter, food, sleep, light, breath, etc. I am trying out an app called presently. Now I have found it is good to focus on generating the feeling of it that grows as you do. It is a sensation of luckiness, light, awe, greenery, just getting some natural light helps immensely and improves my sleep, especially if I do it. First thing, I try to look at clouds as it has, a tendency to trigger calmness within me, which I believe comes from a sense of awe. And what stoics might call the view from above, you get a different perspective. Forest bathing has been shown to help. But the studies suggest that just looking at pictures of green spaces work in some way too short videos, or pics, cute cat pics or animal videos, or short, funny videos. I just stockpile a bunch of them in a youtube playlist. Affirmations I was really skeptical about this at first.But some really helped I read a study on how question versions can be more impactful for some people and this definitely works for me just make sure the questions you choose result in positive statements back accomplishments I have a list of accomplishments I will read but I also compiled a visual powerpoint so I can just hit play when I am feeling down and low energy games there research out of mcgill university on games that have been shown to boost optimism and self esteem they re really simple involving searching grids of faces for the one that is smiling there an app called upbeat mind that I use that does something similar and I find it works for me to start that process of changing my demeanor there are other things some light or short exercise, music, motivational videos, causal inquiry and different meditations can have profound effects I tend to use these a lot for breaks between work sessions I stack them so I will do one thing until I can feel some sort of positive change within then I will move to the next across time. I have noticed it takes less time to generate that internal change. You also get a feel for what technique works best for you and what order to stack them. For example, the smiley face game is really low stakes and easy to start while having the wherewithal to remember affirmations might be a bit more difficult when starting anxious because if you are doingThem without a rewritten set. It relies on you having to generate them I have found by doing them before I absolutely have to do them is also very helpful. Luckily, waking up is a really good trigger to set some of these up as habits and many of them can be done on your phone. Hope that helps

Xanax is a anti anxiety med, not a anti depressant. It common for people to still be depressed while on a benzo. In some cases, it even makes you more moody and irritable.

Title: I hit a car at a parking lot today.

This has been my worst fear since the day I started practicing driving a car I have never really enjoyed driving but today I had to when I was leaving the parking lot, I ever so slightly hit a parked car bumper I felt like I was going to have a heart attack and just froze I felt so horrible I had to just sit in my car for like five minutes before I even had the courage to get out of my car to see the damage I could not see anything on either car but still left a note with my phone number as I know I would not have been able to live with myself if the other car was damaged and I had fled the scene afterwards. I was hysterical as I was terrified. The person whose car I hit was aggressive and would find me and beat me to death. The person whose car I hit sent me a message and thanked me for informing them and said they would inspect the car this weekend and let me know if they notice something. I do not know what to do, because I cannot calm down and am horribly anxious because I have to wait to see if something needs to be done. I also cannot forgive myself and do not know if I am able to drive again for a long time, because I cannot handle the possibility of something like this happening again.

I have always had really intense anxiety, specifically social anxiety, and because of that, have had to live a really isolated life in general home, schooled online college, no social life for the past years. However, I have been working in a big, busy supermarket in customer service. It was the biggest challenge of my life. But eventually I figured it out and could interact with strangers without being anxious whatsoever. Even though I have mastered being around people and socialising with strangers by now, it is become exhausting. I work hours over days a week. I am constantly exposed to people, and I have not been feeling well. For months. I am constantly anxious and stressed. I never sleep. I do not eat. I have no energy for anything outside of work. Its now come to the point I just want to hand in my notice, because I feel like I am too exhausted to spend another day in that place. I have no back up plan, but we could manage with my partners income, but it just feels like giving up. Am I just complaining about nothing? Everyone else manages to work every day. Why cannot i?

I had the same problem at my job. I was working overtime every week and days a week. It made me extremely burned out, thus making my anxiety worse. I talked to my boss for a schedule change, and now I only work hours a week and only days. It definitely helped. Maybe you need a shorter day, like, instead of or hours, you work only hours.

Quitting would be if this was helping you realize a goal or dream. This sounds like you are just figuring out what you want to do. Think about something you would love to do and try to concentrate on getting there. People get burned out and find that they want to change things up a little bit. Quitting should not always be viewed in a negative light.

If it is taking a toll on your physical health, is there a chance you could do it part time or maybe ask them to reduce your hours or change your shift pattern so that you can get enough rest or so it does not exhaust you also, I would not call it giving up if you were to stop. Maybe you need a break. However, I would definitely advise trying that.

My therapist told me to look at anxiety like it is a puffer fish. It pretends to be big and scary, so you will not look at it any further, but as soon as you investigate and poke, it will deflate and disappear. I am not quite at the point in therapy where the puffer fish deflates, but it is an intersting approach. It just so scary because you avoid the particular thought action and because of the what ifs? And I am definitely guilty of avoidance and procrastination.

I do somewhat the same when I was in rehab. I learned that fear initially is a good thing, and it is supposed to warn us to be careful. Yes, that fear can get out of hand, which we all struggle with in here. So just imagine your anxiety as a small, cute creature that is trying to help by telling you to be careful. Instead, mine is a small, fluffy monster, and whenever I am anxious in situations where I know it is irrational, I thank it for looking out for me and make sure to reassure it that were safe and it can relax helped me a ton honestly. I also integrate that in new conversations with new people. I introduce my monster to the people I learn to know. Instead of worrying, what if my anxiety fucks everything up working with it is always easier than working against it. Acceptance helps a bunch

Its because you are releasing all of your emotions and letting them out. I know what you are talking about. It feels kind of euphoric in a weird way, lol, but it is very unhealthy to hold everything in until you cannot take it anymore. You should express your emotions even if you are alone by yourself, and it may even help with the anxiety. Sometimes you just got to have a good cry or punch a pillow.

Im this close to grabbing something sharp. I cannot breath, and I dont know what else to do. I cannot vent on any sort of social media account, because I do not want to push more of my friends away if I can even call them that anymore. I feel like my main group of friends these days are the ones I have from work, and I have fucked up so much at work the past few months, and I can just feel that they all hate me. They hate working with me. No one talks to me unless it is a group work thing and not individual assignments. None of them talk to me specifically outside of work anymore. I always try to start a conversation individually, but it does not go anywhere. Should I just quit? Is quitting equivalent to just committing suicide without actually killing myself, like I would not have to think about any of them anymore. And their judgement and hatred of me. Am I overthinking everything again? Should I just keep quiet about how im feeling? I know I need to see a therapist, but that is not possible for me right now. So I do not know what else to do, aside from just posting here

If it is a job you enjoy and the pay is decent, I would not quit. I know it is easy to say, but if it was me, I would try to hold my head high do my job and not bother acknowledging anyone if they do not reciprocate. I dealt with the feeling of wanting everyone to like me but eventually realized it was not work it. And now I really do not care. Matter of fact, I like to be left alone. And if people do not like me even better, I do not have to pretend to like them.

I go over to him and he grabs both my forearms arms to look me in the eye and say, you look so good. However, his grip was too strong and it hurt me. I said, ouch, that hurts. And he immediately let go and said, sorry. I then took myself away to the bathroom as it triggered me. We spoke about it afterwards and he said he was too excited and it was an accident. He did not mean to hurt me. He also likened it to if I was to accidentally knee him in the balls or scratch him or something, he said, in all the millions of times il touch you sometimes it might accidentally hurt. But he said, he is sorry, has anyone had this before or what do you think

Honestly, it can be a bit of a catch. It might only get better when you stop worrying about it. You ve had it checked out. So you know, it is just your heart. Its thing a dose of anxiety.

Well russia dont have the economy for any major conflict putin is well aware of this. The sanctions that was put on russia in has had consequences for the russian economy. An major conflict initiated by putin would led to more international economic sanctions and boycott which would further hurt the russian economy, which is still feeling the effects of the sanctions. This is just putin putting pressure on ukraine and putin have been using this tactic since the early make alot of noise along the border and have everyone come to his table where he can make demands. That is my personal semi informed take on the matter. Others might disagree heavily. You should probably stop reading the news that helps alot news sell due to their sensational quality and how it thrives on peoples fear of not knowing the latest details.

So for the past few months, ive been struggling with my anxiety and working on it. Previously, I had a lot of rumination and fixation on the things that caused me anxiety. I think ive made progress on that in that I dont constantly think about them, but now I seem to constantly have a tight chest and a high heart rate, and I just kind of feel scared most of the time. But there is no real why this is kind of new for me. Meditation and yoga help with these physical sensations. But its been a few weeks now, and im just kind of wondering, now, what does this end? Can I get a break

I had those same physical feelings and they did go away took about two weeks. It helped me to go to the doctor to get everything checked out and get reassured. It was just stress and anxiety. The chest tightness and racing heart calmed after that it absolutely sucked while it was happening but it does go away in time.

Yeah, I have felt that with many therapists havent found help from therapy yet, but everyone keeps telling me it is trial and error, and it takes a while to find a therapist that you click with and is actually helpful.

I would start looking elsewhere. Everybody is different, though good luck.

It actually worked for me if you guys have any other recommendations, I would love to hear them. I have been doing box, breathing and meditation as well. Hope everyone has a great day and just know that you are not alone in this anxiety endeavor.

I do this as well. A therapist taught me to imagine all the worries as little versions of me sat around a boardroom style table with actual me at the head of the table and to imagine going around the table, thanking my brain for its contributions and being like, thanks very much for worrying and caring for me. I have decided on this route. It has really helped a lot.

Title: Sil is staying with us impact on my wife
Thread
My sil confusion is suffering from really severe anxiety and depression, and she is been staying with us for the last months. The doctors have not quite got her meds right? Yet they have changed her, my sertraline to my citaroplan. She wakes up daily saying she wants to end it all. She does not see how she can change the reason she is staying with us, because at home, her mum has bipolar and will not take any treatment. It is not a nice environment for sil to be in whilst she is so poorly, it gotten to the point. Now, where sil living with us, is really affecting our family. We cannot leave her alone through fear of what she do to herself. So one of us always needs to be at home with her. She written goodbye letters and keeps saying she wants to end it all. In addition to the meds, she has a therapist she speaks to once per week, but that does not seem to be helping either. But it is also really impacting my wife and her mental health. Seeing her sister go through this daily and living with it. I do not know what to do. Sil cannot go home, but she cannot stay here much longer as it is having a serious impact on my wife, and only a matter of time before it will impact my year old. What do I do
Comments
Sounds like sil needs an inpatient mental health facility. Its unfair to put the burden of someone who is suicidal on you and your family.

Title: Is this okay?
Thread
I really struggle with relationship anxiety and reassuring and understanding myself sometimes, so I would like some other input if possible, please my boyfriend. Confusion and I confusion were having some champagne and getting ready to go out for valentines night. I go over to him and he grabs both my forearms arms to look me in the eye and say, you look so good. However, his grip was too strong and it hurt me. I said, ouch, that hurts. And he immediately let go and said, sorry. I then took myself away to the bathroom as it triggered me. We spoke about it afterwards and he said he was too excited and it was an accident. He did not mean to hurt me. He also likened it to if I was to accidentally knee him in the balls or scratch him or something, he said, in all the millions of times il touch you sometimes it might accidentally hurt. But he said, he is sorry, has anyone had this before or what do you think
Comments
I think he was excited and got a little carried away. Sounds harmless as long as he takes what you are saying. Seriously, I do not see a problem here, but that is just me.

Title: Social anxiety and assimilating back into in real life interactions.
Thread
I have been working from home for the last years. I love it for a lot of reasons. I basically have my own private office. I do not have to think about anyone hearing my phone calls. I do not have to think about small talk or putting on a professional mask. My professional interactions have mostly been over phone or video with the world around me starting to open back up. I am expected to participate in real life professionally. We have a hybrid plan working in office part time and from home part time. I think this is great, but I have had very little practice interacting with people in real life for years. I moved to a new city in november so only had or so months to meet new friends. I didnt. So I have not even had much practice interacting recreationally. The only way I know to get better at socializing is with practice, but I have a meeting with a potential new client next tuesday. It will be me and others from my company. I am the engineer. I know what I am doing, but it is like, when I get anxious, my mind goes blank. I look and feel stupid, which does not do much to convince a potential client of our companys capabilities. My last client meeting about a year agoconfusion did not go well. I was super anxious, could not think of questions and could not focus on collecting the information that I would later need toDo my job. I want to have a successful meeting, but I do not really have time to practice. Does anyone have any tips? Youtube videos, motivational advice? I has. Anyone listened to cop lerays song anxiety.

I have pretty bad anxiety when it comes to meeting new people and meetings and not being able to escape. My face gets bright red and I can sweat real bad, but I have noticed that if I initiate conversation or get a laugh from the group before getting down to business, it makes things go a little smoother. It seems like a douchey move, but it puts you in control, which makes you feel less anxious. It can literally be as easy as you asking them, fly in, ok weather, good.

I am assuming this is a go pop, because hydroxyzine does jack for panic attacks. For whatever reason there is been an increase in doctors prescribing hydroxyzine, an antihistamineconfusion. Rather than prescribing actual anxiety medications. Hydroxyzine is not an anxiety medication. And like you mentioned, the only anti anxiety mechanism it really has is making people tired. It helps me a bit with my nighttime anxiety. But it is nothing like actual anxiety medications. More of a placebo effect than anything else in my experience, I am not a doctor, but it is worth trying out anxiety medications for everyday anxiety rather than as needed for panic attacksconfusion. Because it might help reduce the intensity of those spikes. These would be things like sis, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, ex xanax ativanconfusion are considered to be the best treatment for panic attacks, but because of the risk of abuse. Doctors do not prescribe them often, and they likely will not prescribe them if you mention it by name, because they think you are trying to get them to abuse themconfusion.

Title: Feeling lost right now.
Thread
I have been on lexapro for gad for years now, but some recent life changes set off a horrible wave of anxiety that my medication does nothing to curb. Im currently going on nearly months of dealing with thisi wake up very early every morning with anxiety, and then I dry, heave or vomit, and I cannot eat anything. The thought of eating makes me feel sick. I am so hungry that I am in physical pain, but I still somehow have no appetite. I have been to my go twice since this started, and I feel like she does not listen to me and just keeps insisting my current lexapro is fine, and I just need something supplementary as needed for panic anxiety. The problem is, I feel panic and anxiety constantly. From the moment I open my eyes, I cannot take enough hydroxyzine to help. I am so mentally and physically exhausted. I am so hungry that it feels like all my organs are clenched in a tight fist. I have lost around labs now, and I am honestly very scared. I feel like I am going crazy or dying. I do not know I just needed somewhere. I could say all of this

Title: Does anyone else hate when employers want you to put your number on a contact sheet?
Thread
I honestly hate having to either let them put my number on a employee contact sheet or feel like a jerk for making a thing out of it and telling them, no it, my number. I pay the bill. It is not a business phone. I do not want some random people I barely know calling, texting me when they want a shift covered. I have had people call me in the middle of the night to ask me to cover a shift, days after people say, well, then turn your volume down. No, it is my phone. And if for some reason, someone friends or family coworker needing a shift covered is not a emergencyconfusion needs to get ahold of me in a emergency. I leave the volume up. Why should I have to change my way of doing things? I have also had people joke that they were going to give someone my number. I had someone I worked with briefly end up borderline stalking me on and off for a couple years, and I am sure if she had access to my number, I would have had to have it changed. So no, I do not want my number given out. Is it weird? Anyone else like this

Something that helped me was to try and tackle why it was giving me anxiety, at least for me.

If you are willing to sift through the feelings and uncover the root about why future plans give you bad anxiety, maybe that can be the first step to finding a solution. And in the meantime, there is nothing wrong with living in the moment.

I agree with user whatspoon that even those people probably suffer sometimes but it is true that people with more support growing up suffer much less. It worth noting that everybody is different and support looks different for different kids at different times so theres not just one right way to raise a kid and on the other side as you have experienced when support is missing, children grow up with what I callconfusion trauma and suffer more often a lot of it can be healed through spiritual psychological practices.

Yep. This is the symptom that is been frustrating me for years now, it, like your mind and body does not quite coordinate. Mind gets that you are not in danger right now yet, body thinks you are supposed to be in flight mode almost all the time.

The most annoying thing. Honestly, I have anxiety literally and have to pee all the time. I was in the drive thru the other day and felt the urge to go. So I had to reverse out lucky nobody was behind me. I tried taking ago, go less medicine but nothing really works.

Used to buspar and lexapro completely solved this, of course, as I have less anxiety in fact, sometimes I forget to pee now for hours until I am about to pee my pants, I will take it over peeing every mins face with tears of joy.

Title: Anxiety of going to be forced to go to army.
Thread
Hello. I live in poland, and I am scared of army as whole. It brings my anxiety to sky level, and in my country, I have category a, which means that I can be conscripted anytime they want. I am scared. I have little boy son, which is only almost two years. I have told my family that I will commit suicide if they would take me. I am scared and I cannot talk to anyone about it.
Comments
I do not know how it works in poland, but I would go to your family doctor. He might be able to help you or send you to someone who could. Besides then, there would be documentation, so the army would know you have anxiety.

Been using royal cod recommended to me from my doctor my he suggested taking times a day or when I am starting to feel tense I also take buspirone twice a day but in between the doses I take some cod and it helps calm the symptoms of anxiety and helps me get some sleep if I feel insomnia creeping on.

Title: Never truly comfortable or relaxed.
Thread
Hi, guys. I have ptsd, anxiety disorder and panic disorder. I have been struggling with it since I was about years old. I realized I am always tense and I can never truly relax or be myself. I am tense at all times that even family members make remarks about it. For example, if I am at my moms house and we are talking on the couch, she says, sit back and relax, you cannot be comfortable like that. When I realized I am always sitting upright very tense with my arms crossed. Lately, my anxiety has got me debilitated to the point of crying a lot panic attacks just when going to the store or the thought of someone seeing me freak out in the store. Before I even go outside. I feel embarrassed and just worthless. When this happens, I am sure some of you can relate to these situations and feelings people tend to forget how debilitating and hard it is to struggle with mental health issues. I feel very alone in this, even though I have a therapist and a few friends I can talk to, I do not want to bother anyone and just feel like I am having a nervous breakdown. My partner can tell and does his best to try and help. And he does. But like I said, I am very good at putting on a mask like everything is fine. Or I will say, I just tired. When he asks me whats wrong? I have disassociated allWeek and it is very uncomfortable I felt so akward in therapy this week because I did not feel like talking and I felt completely numb like im just existing all I know is that it gets very hard to manage life like this

I am right there with you. I have felt intense anxiety since a young age and dealt with a lot of chronic pains, maybe connected to all of it. I had irritable bowel in my teen years then back pain in my headaches and blood pressure problems. I have got a lot of health stuff that really freaks me out. So I have always been anxious and tense about that lately. I have tried meditation, but that does not work for everyone. If you can get yourself out of your head and into your body, that is a good start focusing on your breathing, visualizing the air as it enters and leaves your lungs. This can help calm me down at times, but it can be so intense I know

It was intimidating, but I successfully sent multiple emails today for work now for the anxiety of waiting for a response. Confusion, grinning face with sweat.

Title: Anxiety gets the best of me.
Thread
Hi, everyone. I recently was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder in december I had some abnormal labs where my bilirubin was, and the doctor kept assuring me that I had gilberts syndrome, but I kept complaining of pain, a loss of appetite, etc. I have done so many labs and everything comes out fine, and I keep getting in my head telling myself, well, what if the doctor is wrong? It got up to the point where my doctor is suspecting that my anxiety is causing me pelvic and urinary issues. I told him that I felt pelvic pain and that I was having some issues urinating foamy urine. Amp sometimes feeling like I was not emptying my bladderconfusion. Well, it got so scary that I was sure I had some type of cancer. My mind always goes to the worst possible scenario. Now, urinalysis, amp, urine cultures in the doctor tells me that everything looks fine. Amp, that my anxiety is probably causing my pelvic muscles to tense up and produce the pelvic pain and foamy urine. I am on a med, but I am just so miserable because I feel like I cannot get better. My worst fear is death because I am not ready for it. My life was going so good. Then this hit me and I have been so miserable, so miserable that sometimes I cannot stop crying, thinking that the worst is coming. Does anyone have some advice or similar stories they could share so that I can feel aBit uplifted. I am miserable.

Youre definitely going to be okay. Health anxiety can be daunting on one hand, the doctors are telling you that everything is fine on the other hand, that may not stop the worry or the symptoms right away this is because simply knowing that you are healthy does not circumvent centuries of inhibitory counter conditioning that pain sensation discomfort, real bodily issue. This is not to say that anxiety is not real, but it does require it is own protocol. If it is of any comfort I had those symptoms and far crazier symptoms to be quite honestconfusion back when I was also enduring anxiety, youre fine, I promise

Seriously, anxiety, making everyday life a living, hell, intrusive thoughts, constant fear, panic attacks, disassociation, constantly worrying, overthinking every little thing until it drives you insane.

Anxiety has ruined so many experiences for me. I used to have anxiety from when I woke up until I went to be, then I got on meds, and now it is getting better, but it is still a problem when I have to go out and stuff it like being tortured every time it happens, I do not wish anxiety issues on anyone.

I confusion am currently seeing someone and am slowly developing more than sympathy for them. I kind of see us at the stage where it is more than reasonable to start talking about where we are heading and show my appreciation for the person, both physical and in words. However, given my past, I am quite hesitant to do so not because I am afraid of rejection, but because I am scared of being played again. I am a quite empathic person who is supportive and caring, which has been abused by some people in the past, not wanting to victimise myself. I must admit that I have let them use myself. I have had my fair share of talks with a therapist about it, and I am aware that the person I am seeing right now has nothing to do with my past encounters. Yet I am scared what to

Title: Other adults are more adult than me. Confusion.

I do not look much like an adult. I basically dress how I have been dressing since I was usually have overgrown hair, and I never style. I have not grown much taller and my voice is not very deep. I have a nice stubble beard, and I get to buy booze. But that is it. Its like I have been messing around for the last years, while everyone else grew up outside of the physical stuff. I do not feel like I am very adult in terms of being productive and having career goals and whatnot emotionally. Maybe I have matured, but I do not feel particularly experienced in anything I still indulge in most of my childhood hobbies, and I do not feel like I am good with women. I get pretty intimidated by other people who seem to have their lives together, including some friends, people who talk about jobs and stocks and making money really stresses me out, because I still do not care much about making a big buck or having a lasting career. I have no problem just talking to people, but whenever they drift towards what I call serious talk, I am completely lost. As a result, most of my friends are either the creative type who will not talk to me about anything like that, or I have known them for long enough that I would not feel weird hanging out with underdressed or feel the need to glamorize. My career trajectory to. I have this assumption thatMost people will find me to childish or immature for talking about the same rock bands and video games that I have been talking about since I was always feel like I have to slowly shape into my adult identity. So I have just been buying a bunch of clothes that end up being really similar to my current style anyway, especially with all the women who say boys are not men or wanting a provider. And whatever really stresses me out, its not that I want to look or seem more mature, but it is more like I see other people my age living up to that while I dont and tbe, I feel very pretentious and not myself when I tried to do things that is more adult, like dressing up for a night out or talk about geopolitical news that I ultimately do not care about. Bottom line is I do not feel any different than I did when I was while my peers are all driving cars, pursuing big careers, spending an hour to get ready for a casual night out and have found their ambitions.

The important thing is that you go to the party do not skip a days dose how much you do or do not drink is up to you and you should base it on careful observation of how you feel do not do shots they are designed to get away from you have a drink, sip it slowly and observe, then decide upon another. The good thing about alcohol is that you know it is full effect in a few minutes unless you are doing shots. Confusion dont spend a second worrying about what anyone will think about how little you drink they will either admire your self control or they can fuck off. I cannot say this firmly enough good on you for wanting to go park in such a way that you can uber home or to someone elses home confusion manage your expectations and have fun. One more piece of unsolicited advice condoms are the best condoms I have ever used by a very large margin. They do not stink, they do not break and they do not feel like a hazmat suit. That last part will be particularly helpful while on an sri like zoloft, have fun. Know, you will likely regret the things you skip, more than the things you do source am year old male with chronic depression and anxiety and many years experience with antidepressants and psychotropics, I regret the things I did not do more than the things I did smiling face with halo

Title: Pregnancy anxiety.
Thread
Not sure if this is the best place to post this but considering it is anxiety related I thought why not I have really been struggling with anxiety about getting pregnant I have been with my boyfriend for about a year now and we started having sex about months into our relationship I am on birth control and we use condoms it seems like every fucking week I am just crippled by the possibility that the birth control and the condom failed every symptom I feel in my body I assume it is pregnancy I take tests at least every other week its starting to make my things really annoying as I hate that I struggle with this we use condoms im on the pill even when I get a negative test I still cannot relax and truly believe it I feel some light cramps or my boobs hurt which I know are symptoms of birth controlconfusion and it does not matter if I have taken tests and they all come out negative. I cannot stop obsessing over the thought. I think about it all damn day. A lot of it comes from the fact that if we were to get pregnant we would not consider keeping it. I am terrified of having to go through that. I know I am going to get some, you are not ready to be having sex comments and that is fine I am I feel ready in every other way other than the fact that I am crippled withWorrying about this, I also have general anxiety, which cripples me, and I cannot get over either. Any advice would help me so greatly. Its sad feeling like this. I have sex with my boyfriend to be intimate and connect with him. I am tired of constantly fucking worrying.

Title: Random sharp chest pain lasts one second.
Thread
Hi, everyone hope all is well, just curious. If anyone has experienced this over the last couple weeks times a day, I will experience a second shock or so in my chest could be on right side, middle or even left side. Sometimes its very painful. Sometimes its a short nudge. Recently, my doctor said, I have anxiety, not taking any medicine as that did not help much. I do not feel too stressed out in life sleeping good eating good, no alcohol or coffee side notes. I have had mri on brain, ultra sound on heart and thyearoids. Blood work done, no issues. Just curious if anyone experiences these random second jolts that can be pretty alarming. Sometimes it radiates to the whole body. It feels like a short zap side note. I am fairly health, and in my early, thank you.

Anxiety is surely a cause of urinary urgency. But pelvic pain, like menstrual cramps, confusion can be a sign of interstitial cystitis too. I have it and have been in remission for years. You have to watch a strict diet while you are flaring. The interstitial cystitis network is a huge help.

Won. My daily battle of getting out of bed also did not have a panic attack or a crying episode this morning, which has been a very problematic start to my days lately, seeing my new psychiatrist tomorrow. So hopefully some relief is on the way. Haven dealt with this level of anxiety in a long timeconfusion.

Title: Battling saris.
Thread
I am years old and pounds. I have worked out in the gym and riding bikes since I was a teenager and am in great shape at age, I started having anxiety and panic attacks. About years ago, I started taking paxil my a day. It worked excellent, until about months ago, when the anxiety and depression starting rearing its ugly head. My doc thought maybe it was time to switch saris and try celexa. My a day, I slowly weaned myself off of paxil for about months, and then the last month started taking the celexa. My a day dose these last months have been a living hell. I am in a constant brain fog and feel like I cannot get going. I also have daily headaches before this. I rarely got a headache. I can barely get to the gym anymore because I have no energy, then I will have a day where I feel normal the next day, though, it is back to the brain fog and depression and headache, I cannot figure out if it is the celexa doing it, or if it is just long term. Paxil withdrawals that so many I have read about have had after being in it for many years, anyone with a similar experience with these saris, or any other combinations I would love to hear from you and what you did. If anything to get through the mess or am I just barking up the wrong tree and my doc and I should be lookingAt something totally different for the cause.

Hey, buddy, curious if there was anything happening in your life that lead up to the anxiety and depression returning what I have learnt is that it is totally possible to have anxious depressive episodes on meds as a justified response to tough things happening seems to me the do switched you pretty fast from something that worked for you so well for years well done on those years bow you ve gone through withdrawals and on to a new med thats a lot of stress to put on the body you maybe recalibrating and leveling out, which involves peaks and troughs bad days. Okay days good days I find it can take a long time for it to even out months even if you find its too much you have the option of returning to the med that did you so well that will always be a tool for you. Good luck.

Title: Tips for a young adult scared of driving.
Thread
Hi. I am sorry if the flair is wrong. Does anyone knows tips for getting the courage to drive? I am and studying to get in a university where I live, you start on the beginning of the year, I am studying to get in next yearconfusion. I dream to study arts, and the best uni at my state is roughly an hour and half away from my house. Four if I go by busconfusion and dorms are not a thing here, I really do not want to burden my parents with driving me, but I am also ridiculously scared and anxious about driving the car just feels too bulky for me to properly drive it. There are way too many rude people that might do things they shouldn there also too many things to pay attention to not to mention that I will have to drive in a highway because it is on the city besides mine. I do not know what to do. Frown, sad, angry or pouting. Has anyone gone through this or similar and has tips? I really want to be able to not only go to this uni but also be free to go where I want whenever I want frown, sad, angry or pouting
Comments
I totally get it when I was learning to drive, I was and I was driving my grandparents big vehicles, and it seemed like the scariest thing. But one thing to keep in mind bulkier vehicles means more body around you, which typically means it is probably safer to drive also, after driving and practicing after a while, it seems like a routine thing to do. I also drive an ambulance too. In high intensity situations, its become second nature youll do great.

Have you been eating anything lately that could cause it to turn yellow? Stress can cause yellow stool, because it speeds up the digestive process, and your body cannot absorb all the nutrients and it can cause it to be yellow. Also, carrots and sweet potatoes can cause it to be yellow. Also, if you are gluten intolerant, you could try limiting your gluten intake for a few days and see if that helps at all.

Title: Always scared of partner leaving.
Thread
Ok, so to start, my anxiety is very. I tend to think worst case scenario, anyways, neither I or my partner are confrontational people, and we dont like arguing. The odd time we do get mad at each other, im always so scared he will leave me if something is making me unhappy, I will just bury it, because I dont want to talk about it and make him angry for fear again, that he will leave me. If you have anxiety, how do you communicate negative feelings in your relationship? We usually get mad, and then both stop talking all together. And it has been, at times, a full day of not speaking to each other a little awkward cause we live together skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant
Comments
I relate to this for the first year of my long term relationship. I was a paranoid wreck half the time. Lol, I think feeling secure just comes with time and with the right person ink. Why I felt so different in year, but I finally just did. Also, though it sounds terrible to live together and not speak, I do not think thats super healthy. You can take quiet time to yourself for awhile and regroup later, but you cannot both just not talk at all for one day or even days on end. In my opinion, thats toxic

I spent years in counseling so that I could understand where all the feelings come from and communicate them accurately to my partner and have a better idea of why she is feeling the way she does at the end of the day. If my partner leaves, I will be crushed, but life will go on. And if then do leave, that is the universe telling me that there is a different plan. If I do not think that way, I spiral out of control.

Title: Advice on meds.
Thread
Considering trying a medication to help manage my anxiety, a psychiatrist I met with twice suggested pristiq. My gyn provider suggested a low dose of lexapro. Does anyone here have any experience with either of both? They would be willing to share thanks in advance.
Comments
I have been on both currently on pristiq when I was in hospital, they recommended I try pristiq. No anti depressant has made it all better for me. Sadly, confusion. But it is something to help a little. I suppose I am currently on my pristiq. I probably should up my dose, but I do not really want to, because it is already quite a high dose, skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant. I am trying to allow months and months for it to work, expect side effects. When you start pristiq, I had bad stomach pain and nausea. It made me not want to take the medication. I lost my appetite, which I loved personally, lolconfusion, but it came back full force. Once the side effects wore off, just hang in there. If you start it, the side effects really will pass for most people, even when it feels like they wont. I did take some time off work. I am still depressed and anxious, but I am not suicidal, and I still feel confident for some reason, pristiq is right for me, I think because it was prescribed by a hospital team of doctors that gave me confidence, and also because I have had my fair share of different meds. I just really feel like good enough is as good as it gets, and it is only going to help me a little not take it all away. Exercise is my greatest tool, but right now, I cannot care enough to get started. IHope as I get well, I will be able to exercise and then see strong improvement from my experience. I definitely think it is worth trying and committing to pristiq, but it is a very individual decision. Good luck.

I guess the feeling is not really nausea, but it is the only descriptor I have. I get a tenseness that comes in waves in my esophagus, my stomach. I think it is the tension from the anxiety, and I get that same feeling. Most times, I am anxious. Im only asking because the nausea and concern with not being able to eat or feeling crappy afterwards caused me a lot of extra anxiety. I really set myself up for failure, because the feeling makes me want to gag on reflex, just incase. It will make it feel better to empty my stomach, ya know, just in case

Wow, I did not know. Other people suffered from anxiety based nausea like I did. I have ibs, which I think initially triggered my anxiety but now my intense nausea, butterflies gagging pretty much anytime I am in a social setting or feel trapped, is not even a product of my ibs foods. It purely anxiety it so frustrating I am glad I can share this misery with others, even though I wish we did not have to suffer like this, it will not be forever.

I know that feeling all to well, I felt so broken, not normal that I could not even eat a delicious meal. I still do sometimes, but I do not dwell on those thoughts. I started counting my calories, which has helped me. I need to get a certain amount. So I shoot for that. Having a goal in mind helps me, and it is a positive one at that. I hate this type of anxiety. One time I was offered hamburgers home, cooked by my boss in their house during my shift, was a ranch hand at the time, and every time I took a bite, I wanted to throw up. I was dry heaving, and it took me a lot longer than them to eat the burger, but I did. I have had many other moments, but yea! This shit sucks, and you feel inferior to everyone else. You re not alone

Yes, I cannot eat. When my anxiety takes over, I get nauseous just putting food in my mouth, and then I get really bad acid reflux from not eating it a horrible cycle. I realize I am doing it to myself everytime and that makes me more anxious. Anxiety is the worst disappointed face.

Oh hell yes. During some really bad anxious periods in my life, I have lost a bunch of weight in short periods of time because the nausea prevents me from eating. Luckily, I have a very understanding primary care doctor who gave me a prescription for an anti nausea. Med it helps tremendously

I guess the feeling is not really nausea, but it is the only descriptor I have. I get a tenseness that comes in waves in my esophagus, my stomach. I think it is the tension from the anxiety, and I get that same feeling. Most times, I am anxious. Im only asking because the nausea and concern with not being able to eat or feeling crappy afterwards caused me a lot of extra anxiety. I really set myself up for failure, because the feeling makes me want to gag on reflex, just incase. It will make it feel better to empty my stomach, ya know, just in case

Sure to be honest I first discovered my mental issues like years ago because of nausea I was working at law office back than and it was during my last year as a student I was preparing for masters degree exam and also exam to become an attorney I started to have nausea out of nowhere and it lasted for months first I thought I was pregnant than that maybe I have stomach cancer I started therapy and it got better today when nausea starts so badly that I lose my appetite and cannot eat I know what it means I actually feel like I would want to vomit but it simply does not happen

Title: I cannot stop picking at my face.
Thread
I have a really bad habit of picking my skin and popping all the pimples, whitehead blackheads that I have on my face when I am stressed or anxious. And my skin is the worst it has ever been, but I cannot stop. Does anyone else do this? And if so, how can I stop?
Comments
I do not pick my face, but since I was a child, I would pick at my upper arms. It was not until my husband and I moved in together that someone acknowledged it. I rarely do it now, but when he sees me, he tries to distract me because he knows im doing it as an anxiety response. Maybe there is something else you can to keep your hands busy when you feel the urge.

Every time I see myself in a photo, I absolutely hate what I see. I look like the ugliest man on earth. I need help. If anyone is interested, I can provide a picture of me so you can give honest feedback.

I am sure that is not true. I feel like all humans can relate to it in an extent. Your mind is constantly mean to you and highlighting what it may want to change. But that is never necessarily the issue. I believe in higher power. I am a christian, so I believe in god. I believe he creates us all for a purpose, and he makes us in his image. Our minds just work against us.

Dont compare yourself to others like that. Stop looking for others approval. You will never ever come out on top if youre in a vulnerable spot. Dont give your heart out to random strangers they will smash it to bits if they feel like

For starters, you are only so you have not even fully grown into your looks. You are so young to be telling yourself that you are ugly. You can send a picture of yourself to every single person on reddit, and every single persons opinion will be different. Why? Because beauty is subjective. What one person thinks is ugly. Another person thinks is beautiful. Regardless. Nobodys opinion matters. This is your life. This is your body. Are you going to spend it hating how you look, or are you going to live it to the fullest? Take care of yourself? Exercise, eat, healthy, get a skincare routine that works for you make sure your hygiene is on point, all of this stuff will make you look and feel good inside and out. I hope you overcome this and get better

I have a tendency to spend money to calm anxiety and generally help me feel good. The spending is not terrible, but it is hurting financial goals, even though I know what is going on. And I technically have a why to stop. I will not actually curb my purchases how to I finally get to point in this situation.

Im no professional. But the obvious answer would maybe be to find other hobbies if you count shopping as a hobby that calm you and bring you happiness, maybe going on walks, listening to music, reading a new book, drawing, playing music or anything other that makes you have the same emotion. I guess youre aware of this issue because its hurting you financially. But maybe you can also start a diary of what things you buy. I dont think you have to cut off shopping altogether, buying something I wanted for a long time or treating myself for a new piece of clothing. Definitely also brings me joy. Maybe to be more aware of how much youre actually spending, you can try to practice writing down. What did I buy in the past week month? Why did I buy it? What emotions did it bring me? And is there something else that can give me those emotions that does not include opening a lot of money? Maybe try to change your thoughts to see shopping in a different manner, cause youre probably already associating. Buying stuff with happiness and calmness. I think a better way to approach unnecessary shopping would be is there something ive actually wanted for quite a while? Or what do I want right now? If I still want it in months? Il buy it. My anxiety can be calmed in other ways. This is only temporary pleasure that I cannot apply. Everytime I feel anxious cause il be broke. I dontKnow if you save up money for anything, maybe vacations or travelling. But a good way, I think, would also be to go through with a week without shopping and writing down all the things you would have bought by. Now, what they would have cost and using this money or half of it, depending how much you need it in your daily lifeconfusion to save up, for example, this week I wanted to buy was close to buying new headphones. Confusion, a candle, confusion, a new mug, confusion, a pillow confusion, a new necklace, confusion. This makes il save up of this for a fun trip in summer. The other il use for groceries or whateverconfusion ink. If this helps, I think the main deal is to stop associating. Buying things with happiness, calming anxiety. Obviously, youl keep doing it makes your anxiety better. Thats totally understandable. If you stop associating shopping with happiness and find other things that calm your anxiety, I think you can resolve this problem

I also shop to calm down, but I have found that putting things in my online cart sometimes feels almost as good as actually buying them, so I will put things in carts and wishlist and then go take a break. A few days later, I come back realize I do not actually want of it, then buy some fun things. It helps reduce my anxiety spending without forcing me to stop outright.

If you are actually diagnosed with anxiety, you are not obligated to take pill. Medications, try other alternatives meditation supplements, exercise, more social, etc.

I am not an expert on anything being is tough. Youre getting to an age where you are starting to be more aware of others, thoughts and actions and fitting in with others in society. While all us older people can say, ya, I have been there, we have no clue what it is like to be a teen today between social media displaying our every fault and failure and the social isolation from couid, it is more difficult than ever limo again, not an expertconfusion. The only thing you can do is just do remember that everyone is too busy analyzing themselves to care too much about what you are doing. I know that teens can be extremely judgy, but in years, you will not remember these kids other than a name in your yearbook. When you feel tight in your chest, take a few deep breaths, it will all be okay. As for confidence, all I can say is fake it til you make it. I know that sounds like crappy advice, but that is what I do. Even the confident kids are experiencing this anxiety. New friends will come. You just got to roll with your mistakes. Everything will be okay. Everyone is awkward at this age, by the way, knowing languages at your age is very impressive.

Im going trough this as well what I usually do is just isolate from everyone. So my best advice is do not do that also, you should consider therapy if the problem affects your life deeply and mine try to force yourself to interact with other people if you able to hope this helps.

I have panic disorder and pure ocd. Usually I have panic attacks out side of my house or are situational. As of the last months, I cannot escape the anxiety. I have mild agoraphobia. But even when I am home, the anxiety is severe and have daily panic attacks at home. I am in talk therapy and have tried some different meds and still trying new ones. Anyone else feel this.
Comments
I have stations in my house for the anxiety attacks. I have workout equipment, an area where I paint for therapy, video games, some drums and a pile of mental health related worksheets, depending on how bad the anxiety is usually decides what I will be attracted to. I try to stay off the phone screen and try to use coping skills to keep me grounded. Do you have anything you do at home that helps if you do try to find a few more? So if one does not work, you can try another.

I mean, my anxiety was bad. I have not worked since couid shut down my workplace. I am back in work again, and my anxiety has increased tenfold work takes away my entire life. I wake up extremely anxious, to the point of basically crying. There is so much stress in me and my eyes water so bad I cannot eat food at all. My stomach hurts so much, and if I eat, I feel like I am going to throw up. I already wake up trying not to throw up. I cannot relax. Outside of work. I am so anxious to go back, and I am anxious, I will squander the time I have off and do the wrong thing. I cannot even sleep. My sleep is so fucked up. I wake up so many times. I do not get good enough sleep to even go to work does not even have to be bad. It any work, any school, anything I have to sacrifice a big portion of my life for it gives me intense, overwhelming anxiety. It been this way my whole life. I thought I was sick all the time. Growing up going to school because of how my anxiety would make me nauseous. I woke up crying every day. As a kid, I would never eat breakfast and struggled to eat at all. I just do not want work to take my entire life away from me. What am I doing? I am sacrificing. My entire life, my happiness, my mentalHealth for what to make money so I can enjoy the few little hours I have for myself. I cannot even enjoy those because of anxiety to pay for a house and food. Literally the most fundamental pieces of the hierarchy of needs where has my life gone? I do not have one. I am not living a life. If I have to work to live, my life just is not worth it. Not like I do not want to work at all, but the opportunities for work I actually want to do are slim esp, since I would still have to go back to school for years and years to do what I want to do in the end, if everyone could just get into their dream job, then no lowly work would exist at all. I just do not know what my life actually means. I do not know if it truly has any meaning. Most of it is just surrendered to corporation. Corporate owns me. I took my time off work from couid for granted. Mental illness ruined it for me. But at that point, it was only mental illness factor in work, and it is so much more than that. I have no life. I am not living a life. None of this really seems worth it.

Its interesting. You have identified parallels, and the reason for your anxiety sounds like something that is best worked on with a therapist or mental health coach. My coach would say something like, what can you live with? What do you need to do to survive, or what can you eliminate? I think you need to find a compromise with yourself. You may feel like you are wasting your life, but what would make you not feel that way? And how realistic is

Title: Imposter syndrome at work and low self esteem.
Thread
Hi. I have really struggled a very long time with anxiety. It affects my work a lot as I am constantly worrying that I will do something wrong, I guess I have low self esteem and an underlying belief that I am not good enough should not be there, and something will go wrong, and it will be my fault, and the consequences would be disastrous. I find making calls with clients particularly difficult as I do not like the pressure of thinking on my feet when asked a tricky question, I just cannot stop worrying about it, particularly as I have started a new job. So think I feel the pressure to prove to everyone that they made a good choice hiring me. Does anyone else have difficulties with this? I would very much appreciate any tips or things that have helped you. Thanks.

Yeah, that is my most common symptomskeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant. The moment I get anxious about anything, my stomach starts to hurt and my appetite shuts off. I get really nauseated and sometimes have bathroom issues. I have thrown up from anxiety before I hate it. So freakin much how sick I get from anxiety is the number one thing about anxiety. I wish I could change, but I have not learned how to yet, and I ve had anxiety for my entire year old life. It ruins a lot of things like first days of school jobs or even fun things like vacations or doing something brand new to hang out. I also agree with other posters. Mornings are the worst for me, since usually whatever is making me anxious is happening in the morning, and I probably did not sleep well the night before anticipating it

Title: My life is pointless.
Thread
Every job I apply to in my field has, like other applicants. By the time I see it, I have master degree, and I am knowledgeable about all the typical crap word excel, powerpoint, google docs, wordpress, etc. But it is never enough. I had an interview with a guy from a company that offers a platform to writers a couple of days ago, and I had to listen to his whole spiel before he informed me that I would have to pay bucks for training before I would have access to any jobs. Even after that, the company would still deduct a hefty percentage from any jobs I completed. I talked to some dude from a coding bootcamp today, and that conversation was equally bleak. Even if I did somehow manage to find a decent job. After graduating, I would be up to my eyeballs in debt for years. I honestly do not know what else to do. I feel so beaten down by life right now, every day, I feel like I am being crushed a little bit more by the mounting sense that I am not meant to do anything meaningful or even well paid enough for me to be comfortable with my life, and it makes me want to die. I just turned, and I feel like my life is over

Bit of advice for applying to jobs apply to them first thing in the morning and not in the afternoons or evenings. He starts at the top of the pile and not the bottom of applicant. This has helped me immensely. It is also a trick I learned working for your monsters. Com of the world before, indeed, linkedln crapped all over them. Same principles applyconfusion. Your life not pointless. Keep on trucking homie.

Title: Constant fear of loved one dying.
Thread
Hello. I recently developed an extreme fear of loved ones dying, especially my parents and brother. I have always had this fear. It started about years ago when my mom was diagnosed with cancer, but I was usually capable to control it and function normally. Recently, my aunt passed away, and months later, my mom had a health scare. All is well now, thankfully, but ever since I started having crippling thoughts of someone I love dying, they are constant and are affecting my capacity to function normally. Any advice to ease these thoughts or control them. Thank you.
Comments
I have the same thing. Whenever my mom or family member leaves the house, I question the possibility of them getting into a car wreck and not coming home. It could be a mix of separation, anxiety or ocd if you constantly have unwanted thoughts about that and obsess over the possibility and bad outcomes unwillingly, the only way to cope with it is to reassure yourself and step back from a logical point of view. Death is apart of life, and a very hard pill to swallow.

Title: Heart rate and anxiety.
Thread
So I am a little worried and confused about my heart rate. Lets say anxiety started months ago, and my heart rate seemed fine. Walking around and doing things I did not notice it. That is for sure. Recently, when I get up and walk around the house, just for a minute or two, my heart rate goes crazy, and its easily noticeable for me this in turn causes me to freak out a little. I think it was bum. Last time I did this, I have been laying in bed most of the day for the last month and a half. Just for some clarity, I have gotten some tests done because of anxiety. I have had an mri, spinal tap, blood tests, urine, tests they did like a scan of my heart. With a machine, I forget what it is called. All of my tests have came back good that I can remember. My hemoglobin was a bit high, but that is, it can anxiety cause this to happen? Is this something that will eventually fade down to normal ranges? Again, any advice is greatly appreciated. I believe, if I can get this lowered along with breathing a little better, my anxiety will be more manageable for me.

Thats very normal for anxiety. I recommend you take a medication called propranolol, which slows the heart rate to a normal resting state and calms your anxiety if that is triggering it.

Title: Hello, all new here.
Thread
Hello, long time. Add anxiety sufferer. I was just curious, so I have been having terrible anxiety for what seems like years straight. I have tried meds, and now going back into talk therapy, I had a question, though does anyone suffer from long term pains like physical? I have pains that come and go are pretty much always in the same spots, but they have been lingering for at least a year. Any insight from fellow anxiety sufferers?
Comments
I do not know about the spots, but pain is very common for anxiety can cause a multitude of symptoms and even rashes or needing to use the bathroom frequently. It can cause migraines and nausea as well. I would seek a doctor, though, if the pain is in the same spots.

Title: Time.
Thread
I have always been anxious, but my back is against the wall. Now, growing up, I wanted to be the light of the world. I used to tell myself, give yourself to the world. And I have done my best working full time in one of my favorite fields, while also an apprentice in a corresponding field, while also going to the gym regularly. I am also the guy in my family. Everyone calls to get shit done, but if they could only see how close to the anxiety edge I am physically and mentally, I appear to have my shit together. But I dont not at all. Weed does not help. It only fuels the paranoia that time is running out and makes me feel guilty, because everyone knows how strong I appear to be. But if I show weakness to those who depend on me, everything could crumble, I take care of a lot of people in different ways physically, emotionally, financiallyconfusion. I seem to be able to help everyone except myself. Anyone else feel felt like this. How do you indigo yourself from this mental hole?
Comments
Yes, I do not know if you are a male or a female, but there is a stigma around showing weakness. I think it shows how strong of a person you are for letting people into that realm of your personal feelings. You do not have to put on a front for people I know mentally, you may think of the negative reactions or outcome of sharing this issue to light, but the opposite may happen, and they may respect you more for being honest about this, it seems like you have a natural care, giver, personality. And personally, I am the same way you should definitely prioritize yourself first when it comes to mental health, though it can be very exhausting and overwhelming to constantly be everyone is superman. I do not know if you have ever gone to therapy or have had medication before, but it can really help. And the positive results can be life long. You cannot fill up a plate for other people with food and be able to feed yourself. Being strong can also mean letting your guard down every now and then, too. You should also have someone to depend on. You should not be alone in this. I would at least talk to someone about this before it gets to be too much and you cannot take it. Anymore. I hope the best for you

Title: Are there any sleep drugs that do not put you out for greater than hours with no sleeping pill hangover?

I am a pod student and I overloaded myself this semester. I am having frequent panic attacks and work hours per week. I take my lexapro and benzo as needed, my doxepin as needed for sleep as needed. Plus low dose of adderall in the morning. The issue is, the doxepin knocks me unconscious for hours. My schedule does not allow me to sleep more than hours at a time. I have tried trazodone and same deal. No ot sleep aids work for meconfusion. The benzos are great because I can take my stop my panic attack, then wake up hours later, refreshed, and be ready to go and start studying again. Plus, do all my work in the lab, no post sleeping pill hangover. I am afraid to ask to temporarily up the benzo just until my schedule normalizesconfusion, because I sound like a drug addict, but ink, what other options are out there? If I do not get all my lab work done, my pi will make sure there is hell to pay. And if I do not study enough, I will not get straight a in my classes. Plus, I need to do other normal people, stuff like laundry, etc. Is there a drug that will only knock me out for a few hours, so I can wake up and keep studying without the sleep hangover. I know this is not an ideal situation and is very unhealthy, but is my reality? At the moment I get up at midnight every day, studyUntil then go to lab and work, go to class, till if I have a long experiment. I get there as early as midnight, then come home around, do all my normal people chores, then sleep for four hours and do it all over again. I am breaking here.

What I did was use intermittent mla so my therapist basically signed paperwork saying whenever I needed to leave work or miss days I could and could not get in trouble for but I could still come to work on the better days she signed it for me for like months and it truly did help even knowing I had the option made me feel better and it was nice to be protected when I did need to call out the therapist who signed it had not been seeing me that long I actually found her through my works employee assistance program.

Depending on what kind of job you have. If you have not been written up or screwed up badly at work recently, I doubt you are being fired. How is the company doing financially? Could it be a layoff in which case you would have unemployment? Maybe it is something good like she wants to promote you or has a special project. She wants your help on? Heck, maybe you are getting a raise.

I feel the same thing at first, when I felt nausea, I thought that maybe I ate something expired and that the problem was with my physical health. It has been going on for weeks, and I thought the only way to feel better was to actually vomit. Later, when I actually got to the doctor, she said there was nothing wrong with me physically. That was when I found out that it was anxiety making me feel that way. Since that, I have been feeling cause most of the time im anxious. Try drinking water eating healthy, doing stuff that calms you. Meditation is also helpful. Hope this helps and you get better

Title: Does anyone elses anxiety feel like nausea?

I guess the feeling is not really nausea, but it is the only descriptor I have. I get a tenseness that comes in waves in my esophagus, my stomach. I think it is the tension from the anxiety, and I get that same feeling. Most times, I am anxious. Im only asking because the nausea and concern with not being able to eat or feeling crappy afterwards caused me a lot of extra anxiety.

I feel the same way, and it is really hard to keep food down. After a really intense break up, my abandonment anxiety went through the roof and I could go two days without eating, because the nausea would be too much. But then my anxiety would get worse due to no food. Try to eat, then get sick and start over again. Eat. Slow, small, plain things. Then work yourself up.

Nausea always happens with mine when it is really bad. Getting fresh air sometimes helps. I get it driving to work a lot. I just roll the window down a little even if it is freezing outside. Sometimes that cold air really helps the most.

Holy hell yes. If I am going through an especially bad episode, I get terrible nausea plus my gag reflex gets insanely sensitive usually to the point where if I even open my mouth too far, I will gag.

Yes, actually. The other day, the anxiety was so bad, I was nauseous and light headed. I got up and collapsed. The feeling in my chest was truly debilitating. Lucky, I was working from home that day and did not have to make the hour drive into the office. It scary because you really cannot do anything at the point. But let time take control. I tried everything from breathing techniques, showering, just hugging a pillow and watching, to mindfulness, you name it. The anxiety was just too overpowering.

For me, it is more of a butterflies in my stomach feeling and a complete loss of appetite even if I have not eaten.

Yes, like of the time, my anxiety symptoms are gi related. So either nausea, diarrhea, nausea sucks, because I probably will not even throw up. I just start gagging or feel like gagging, which is super uncomfortable. This is also accompanied by what I would call a block in my throat, like when people say foot caught in your throat or whatever, that saying, isconfusion, it awful. So I have to be extra gentle. Gi wise, like drink, liquids, hold off food because I will not have an appetite, etc.

Yes, I cannot eat. When my anxiety takes over, I get nauseous just putting food in my mouth, and then I get really bad acid reflux from not eating it a horrible cycle. I realize I am doing it to myself everytime and that makes me more anxious. Anxiety is the worst disappointed face.

I like this heavy workload, though, dont get me wrong. I just want to sleep. And I think this problem has to do with some anxiety thing, considering the pounding chest that used to have when experiencing social anxiety. If you have any solutions, please share. I cant keep doing this

Anxiety is tricky. Once you are anxious, you can easily get trapped in a cycle of being anxious about the physical and mental issues caused by the original anxiety. To progress, you need to identify what the source of your anxiety is, so you can start to pull the knot undone in the mean time. Try listening to talk down and relaxation vids at night.

Hi. So ive had anxiety for about as long as I can remember diagnosed when it was very young as of late. I have also had major sleeping problems. You are super tired, but the minute you lay down, at least for meconfusion, your mind is racing and will not shut off. Melatonin helps me as it forces me to be so tired, I cannot think anymore. So if you have not tried it, I would suggest that, though it does make you slightly tired in the morning, im still struggling with it, so I do not really have any other solutions, but I wish you the best in getting some better sleep.

Comments
I completely get what you mean. I suffer from the same problem if you have severe panic attacks and anxiety that also shows it effects mostly periodically, like weeks can be pure hell. Then the other or weeks feel fineconfusion. Then a slowly working sri is almost completely pointless. I am speaking from personal experience. You need to tell your doctor that you need a drug that has immediate effects like xanax or othersconfusion. So he understands the severity. Despite that, it also can have severe side effects on your life, because taking it will make you unable to drive a car or even walk without stumbling, depending on the doseconfusion it will sedate you during the day, and you will just lie there like a vegetable or even fall asleep for multiple hours that the side effects that I notice personally on me others can have different experiencesconfusion. So obviously it would interfere with your job or other obligations that you have in your daily life. Most of the time, you only got put on sedatives in a controlled environment like a hospital, and on much stronger dosis that what you get for home use from your doctor you could still od on purpose of. But you get my pointconfusion. I am currently unemployed and on a job reintegration program for the mentally ill. And right now I am in some kind of online class and don have to drive to work. I am just telling you this as a backstory that sedatives can beReally helpful. But that depends not just on your medical history, but also on your personal life, because I simply would be unable to work properly during the influence of this sedative. Oh, and they can also make you physically addictive. So some doctors can be hesitant to describe them for home use and longer periods of time. Usually, the package only lasts for a couple of weeksconfusion. So the best way might be to go to a psychriatic clinic, because this is what I plan to do for myself, and this is where you can and will get the medication you need, and more importantly, professional help.

Title: Hello, everyone. This is my story.
Thread
Hey, I am so glad that I found this subreddit first of all, I want to say that I am not a native english speaker so please excuse any mistakes I am suffering from severe anxiety that has taken over my life completely it all started in even though I was always an anxious person this was the year where it got really bad all of a sudden I was constantly dizzy, which further fed my panic attacks my body did not feel like it belongs to me anymore. My arms seemed too long, and the dizziness was not exactly this round and round dizziness rather like you are on a boat. When I went to my doctor, he found out that I suffer from hashimoto. Basically, my thyearoid is not producing enough hormones because my body is producing antibodies against my thyearoid and is literally destroying it. I got artificial hormones and the symptoms got better after a few months, but my anxiety was not really that bad at this point, I was still able to go outside. In late. I have met my ex girlfriend, and we got together. We stayed together since july, but it was a very toxic relationship, which kind of traumatized me in many ways, was an almost completely anxiety dizziness, free time for me until came along, and I started to feel bad again since me and my ex girlfriend broke up. It has gotten to a point where I can barely even stand anymore. My knees feel weakAnd shake I got tingling feelings in my legs and hands sometimes I even developed a fear of swallowing food because I am afraid to choke on it which is super annoying because it makes every meal feel like a punishment since I am very thin I cannot go without food for a long time without getting the low blood sugar shakes the weirdest thing is that sometimes when I fall asleep and I wake up all my muscles start twitching or at least it feels like it anyone has experienced that before confusion this actually scares me so much but it comes and goes and is probably also related to my thyearoid for me I have come to the conclusion that I cannot live my life like this anymore for way to long I have tried to work on it on my own but knowing that I cannot even go grocery shopping anymore without getting a panic attack makes me feel like I can also not go anywhere else I am going to study medicine next year and I really want this it is my biggest dream to become a doctor but at this point I ask myself if I will ever be mentally strong enough to deal with all the stress my neck is tense all the time and my doctor said the dizziness could also come from my neck, but I do not know I am constantly afraid to die or to loose my loved ones. I am mourning my year relationship andAt the same time, deal with a lot of exams and pressure. Some days I feel good, not good, but not as bad. I just want a normal life again. Thank you for reading this. I think it really helps to open up. I kind of look at this as my first step into recovery. I would love to hear your stories and advice. If you feel like sharing hope, you all recover soon and take care of yourselves. Edit I also suffer from ocd, my thought process goes like this. If I do this and this and this, then I will not get sick, choke on my food, person will not die, etc.

I cannot express how sorry I am that you are currently enduring this. I went through a very similar experience after breaking up with my fianc. I could not eat sleep or barely stand. If I was out of bed for a few minutes, I would be racked with constant adrenal dumps, chained panic attacks that had me crying for help and dialing an ambulance each time for a trip. Anxiety after a relationship, especially a toxic oneconfusion, can be hell on earth for plenty of evolutionary conditional and chemical reasons. Fortunately, we can choose to be proactive in our recovery, just to give you an idea of just how fast it can all turn, arountongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. I was standing in my kitchen plotting how to commit suicide, and months later, I cured my anxiety. For of the past years, I have woken up in an elated state of bliss, an absolutely surreal experience. I have since taught others how to overcome their anxiety and find that bliss in their own lives as well. You already have firsthand experience living without anxiety. At one point, your anxiety was dormant, but now that it is surfaced, you have the opportunity to address it. You can do this. Anxiety does not have to be a life sentence. It just requires taking action, feel free to reach out for any advice. My are always open

I know that feeling all to well, I felt so broken, not normal that I could not even eat a delicious meal. I still do sometimes, but I do not dwell on those thoughts. I started counting my calories, which has helped me. I need to get a certain amount. So I shoot for that. Having a goal in mind helps me, and it is a positive one at that. I hate this type of anxiety. One time I was offered hamburgers home, cooked by my boss in their house during my shift, was a ranch hand at the time, and every time I took a bite, I wanted to throw up. I was dry heaving, and it took me a lot longer than them to eat the burger, but I did. I have had many other moments, but yea! This shit sucks, and you feel inferior to everyone else.

So she was shocked at the prospect of me not being here in a few months.

Hey, I am from ukraine, and you have heard the news, right? I have always been a nervous, anxious person, though I never been to a therapist and never been diagnosed with any disorder or something. But I am that guy that thinks, oh, there is a chance that I will die when taking a bus to the other city. I think I should visit a therapist with that thoughts. So I am currently living and ukraine. Nearly half of my day, I am thinking, if the war will start, and if it will, what should I do and stuff today? I heard wind hitting windows of my office, and I was like, oh shit, what was that sound? Is something happening there? All these awful thoughts keep running in my head, and I am getting tired of it. I try to not read the news but keep getting into news websites and read articles like us, informs that russia will invade ukraine in couple of days. Thats scary, and I cannot keep myself off these websites and clear. Keep my mind to calm myself. Please. If anybody can advise, how can I calm myself or be less anxious, I would be very grateful, because sometimes I feel that I cannot stand these thoughts anymore, and I am going to lose my mind any advice. Welcome. Thanks.

Although it may seem unavoidable right now think of all the times in history the worst has not happened we would not be here if it had talk is easy the truth is hard to find, and journalists and politicians all have biased and interests to promote. My advice would be to try and disconnect every once in a while our brains suffer when they are given too much information of a type. They did not evolve to process if you exist with only the information that arrives organically and less rapidly, I think you will know all that you need to know to stay safe and well informed and you will avoid all of the noise which clouds your judgement and burdens your heart just remember we re right here. Whatever happens

Hi. I am from a neighboring country which is constantly paranoid about russia. In every field of politics, the fearmongering and sensationalism in the media is constant it. One of the reasons I just stopped reading the news altogether, the other being couid, triggeringconfusion. And once I did, the world somehow started looking waay, different, more varied and hopeful. We cannot determine whether war will or will not happen, unless maybe you want to give your whole life to politics. But even then, it seems to be quite a tough cookieconfusion. And knowing about it, or constantly hearing about it will do nothing for us personally. News give a false sense of control, and always a hunger for more. What we can do are maybe decide what we want to know and from where it ok. To not know everything, it is actually impossibleconfusion. What to talk about, agreements, not to talk about couid with friends. During the early panic, were really helpfulconfusion. What to do today. And then on a bigger scale, perhaps where to live, who to live with, what to work, etc. I am now sometimes shocked when I ask my grandma how she is doing, and she just starts naming all the horrible things from the news which make up her reality there so much world beyond that the situation in ukraine might objectively suck, but it is not your fault.

Stoicism can be a helpful way of thinking during difficult situations where you feel like you have no control. Also, as others have mentioned, reading any kind of news is a bad idea. Every single credible news outlet is obviously going to make out like they know an invasion is imminent because that makes them more money. The fact is that nobody except putin and russian military commanders actually know if or when an invasion will happen. You do not need to read the news to stay informed. If anything as serious as this actually happens, you can bet that it will not take long for you to hear about it through word of mouth and try to remember every day without another war is a reason to feel grateful

Wow, I understand how anxiety provoking this situation is. I cannot say much as I am not in your shoes but just try to breathe through the tough parts and rationalize the best you can.

Title: Whats your coming off? Zoloft setraline experience.
Thread
I have been on setraline for a couple months now to treat my anxiety. Before I started medication, I was having palpitations, numbing sensations in my hands and chest, shortness of breath and nausea. Overall, I noticed huge improvements and reductions in my panic attacks and anxiety issues since getting on setraline. One side effect I did experience was a significant tightness in chest and elevated heart rate that gave me lots of discomfort. Towards the end of december, I quit my job, which was a big reason for my elevated anxietyconfusion. And I was removed from my health insurance since I was not sure how long I would be uninsured. My do issued me a large prescription to cover a decent duration of time. I now have a new job where I am much happier and paid significantly more, but it does not offer a health insurance plan. I am towards the end of my meds and decided to stop. Its been a few days, and I have had some weird reactions. Today, I am super light headed. The other day, I was getting bad heart palpitations and waves, blackout flashes throughout the afternoon. For anyone that has come off setraline zoloft, can you share your experiences? How long did they last? Did you stay off? Or did you find yourself needing to go back
Comments
I was told by my doctor that you should not just stop taking sertraline from one day to the other, but gradually lower the dose until you are off it. That might be why you are experiencing discomfort. I had mild side effects getting on sertraline, and I was just upping the dose with my per week. I am now at my, and I could not imagine just to stop taking it. I am pretty sure I would have some wild withdrawal symptoms. I am not a doctor, but that is my suggestion talk to your doctor about if you are unsure

Title: How to limit intrusive thoughts.

So recently, I fucked up, got my first tattoo, did not realize all the implications of getting one. I feel stupid and regret it, and I am ashamed of myself for making such poor choices. This tattoo is funny, but in really bad taste, and there is no way I am carrying this around for the rest of my life. It really like I thought it was temporary, but it is really not just my biggest brain. Fart ever at least I am having a reality check and a good life lesson thanks to it, but it is also a burden. I took the decision that I will get it removed with laser when I get the money, best case scenario I have it in monthsconfusion. I feel pretty anxious about confusion, telling my mom about both the tatto and the regrets, removal, confusion, telling my friends about the regrets removal. My problem is that I took this decision of getting it removed like a couple weeks ago, and I am still having this intrusive, anxious thoughts running in my head. It annoying me a lot, because the situation will not evolve for weeks. I have already covered the subject in my head, and this thoughts do not lead me nowhere. They are just making me feel dreadful. And that is the only thing they do, but I cannot manage to make them stop. I am constantly thinking about it for weeks, and I have had troubles. Enjoying anything since then is do not be asStupid as me think your tattoos through and ask yourself if you still want them in years.

If it makes any difference. I hated my first tattoo for a month after I got. It literally could not stop thinking about it, and it drove me crazy. But after about a month I got used to it and forgot about it. Now I like it could be worth waiting. Laser removal will always be there.

But this is the first I have heard of it, and my anxiety spiked when he said that he even said in the next few weeks it could happen so that did not help.

The only way that this will be the end of everything is if it becomes a nuclear war. Putin may be insane, but he is not stupid enough to start that fight.

I would report your teacher for scaremongering pupils if I was in your possession. Doubt it would do anything but still. For someone who is there to help teach and guide the next generation, not quote, whatever shady facebook post sharon shared last night, how the sky is falling and blah, basically, your teacher is stupid.

Title: Where to start on negative racing thoughts.
Thread
Usually it happens when I got some free time and not distracted nor working. I get racing thoughts of any issue. It is like, what if I am not spending enough time with parents as they are getting too old? Or what am I going to do about my finances? It happens whenever I wake up or try to go asleep, I need a distraction to put myself to sleep. Usually I listen to podcasts or music, and if I wake up before my alarm, there is no going back to sleep cause my thoughts start racing. Naps also impossible unless I am super tired or watching to or on phone, it will never happen. My question here, what kind of therapist should I approach? Cut, for example, or can I read on this more and figure it out by myself? It probably anxiety, related, as I am always imagining the worst scenario, and I need to talk myself into being calm once more I feel also, it limits me from trying out new things or putting myself out there. As I imagine the worst scenario for initiating most social interactions
Comments
Introspection and meditation take on the thoughts head on and do a self analysis of why you feel, think that way initially, you will be overwhelmed by the idea, but once you have a grip of the causes and triggers, you will start feeling a sense of confidence and control over the effect the thoughts have on your self. Eventually you will start eradicating them with time and patience. There a lot of things in the subconscience that effect, people without them ever knowing. Try your self and if it still does not work or gets to a point where you cannot get bye, you seek medical advice. Sure, a good psych evaluation does not hurt, but it is better to start with one self than to go on medication and prognosis

I have gad, and I dont know why exactly, but hot or even warmconfusion rooms make me really anxious. I went to the hairdresser today, and while I have no problem with social anxiety, the people were really nice and everything that room was, in my opinion, quite hot. And even though I was sitting down, my heart beat up to my throat, and I felt like my breathing was very shallow. I had to do the usual yawn to get a full breathconfusion. But im asking myself why its just warm temperature. Then I may sweat a little, so what I genuinely dont get where it comes from. I get the same in supermarkets or university classes, im literally afraid of unaired, stuffy rooms that I plan my whole day around them. And if I have to, il just somehow deal with the physical symptoms of it. Could this possibly be related to my fear of passing out? I once passed out in a supermarket, and it was the most embarassing, traumatic experience for me. But I know that it was just cause I ate too little that day. Its not like I pass out every other day. I thought I was over it. My friend once told me one girl in her class passed out cause they had to stand because there were no seats left in the university classroom. Could hearing things like that subconsciously affect my anxiety? Im even afraid of standing for a long time. Add to that a hot roomAnd il definitely call in sick winking face.

Probably because being hot increases heart rate in order to make sweating occur so your bodys increased heart rate is probably associated with anxiety, like symptoms in your mind. And just in general, being hot is uncomfortable regardless of anxiety. So makes sense I would just remind yourself you are safe trust your body it knows what it is doing. You can try the dare app its helped me a lot. Do not be afraid of anxiety symptoms. They come and go, you will be okay.

You do not need to get things off your chest. It sounds cruel, but you need to take steps to downplay it not just your symptoms, but to be somewhat okay with the anxiety. Its all about what you tell yourself and not about struggling to calm down or barking up the wrong tree, trying to find a hidden psychological problem. Leave your emotions out of this. Look up. Somatic symptom disorder, and pavlov's dog, commiserating with others is actually counterproductive. I feel for you. I suffered through heart related panic for years off and on. I totally kicked it.

Title: How do I stop negatively obsessing over people?
Thread
Title kind of says it all. I have the unhealthy habit of obsessing over people in a negative way. Why do they act like that? Did they do that to intentionally hurt me? Is my friend group trying to get rid of me so they can spend time alone without me. I am getting these moments of paranoia where I think my friends are out to intentionally hurt me mentallyconfusion, and ill. What to do about that is that still only anxiety. Thank you for listening.

I think you should ask yourself if this kind of thought process develops in other situations too. For example, you mentioned your friendsdo. You also have this type of thoughts in work situations bosses and coworkers family.

That can certainly be your anxiety. My anxiety has certainly presented this way at times. Your brain could be trying to protect you from experiencing emotional pain by keeping you defensive. This could also be a symptom of something more too, but it would require a professional evaluation, I think. But yes, only anxiety can certainly manifest this way. It more common than you think.

Title: Need to distract my anxiety. But how?
Thread
What should I do to distract my mind from overthinking?
Comments
Find something that interests you is the best distraction for me. I have to, both mentally and physically, be tired for it to be calmer and manageable. So I work out daily dance and sing to music, and I read books, study things that interest me. It does not have to be intense, just something that occupies your mind. You could go for a walk or just get some air if this is not one of your triggersconfusion call. A friend or family member watch movies or documentaries on anything that interests you or even something new meditation. This is difficult for me. I play some music and focus on my breathing, not traditional meditation, but it is adapted in a way that helps me best do things to relax you, like a nice, warm bath with some pampering anything that directs your focus to something else. Its trial and error. Itl take time to find what works for you. When my anxiety is awful. Sometimes I just have to let myself feel the emotion and acknowledge it. I write down all the triggers and thoughts as a way to let them escape, in a way to let it go make a list of things you are grateful for, things that have gone well for you that day or over a couple months, hope you find something that works for you soon.

Personally reminding myself that a lot of the fears I have are literally bullshit. I do still have the fears of when I leave my house, that random things are going to happen when I am not there. But that is manageable. I can act like I know what people are thinking as much as I want, but I am not a mind reader. No one actually thinks about me as much as I think they do. I am not that important. If I think someone is talking about me, I will actually joking. Insert myself into the conversation and say, oh, staawhp talking about me it is too much just to reiterate that even if they are who cares honestly, it has no effect on me. If it does, then fuck it. I control my narrative, which leads me to a more out there thought process. We get stuck in negative thoughts way easier than positive ones. The vibrations are lower and easier to maintain. Good things are hard to maintain because they take more energy. You can kill a house plant with no effort, but keeping it alive takes time and energy. So why are we putting no effort into our speech? We say things like, things are so difficult, it is never easy. Well, therapy says to reframe your perspective to a positive. Now you can say things may seem difficult, but there is always a solution or I can becomes? I may not succeed, but I tired whatever works for you whatWe say becomes our reality. Words are spells. Why are we casting spells of fear and doubt on ourselves? When instead we can change our words and lift ourselves out of the shit if that is too weird, trying to just let things go that no longer serve, you can be helpful. That includes negative self talk the way we care about what others think, not taking care of ourselves, replace it with being aware of the present. Nothing in the past matters because you cannot change it. Nothing in the future matters because it is not here yet be here now.

Title: Anxiety spiking, reassurance, neededconfusion.
Thread
Edit thank you guys for responding. I am doing better now lol. It was just the fact that I had not heard anything about this prior to a few days ago, and then all of a sudden the threat of a war is put into my head, but again, thanks. So my history teacher just told us that russia might go to war with ukraine, and if they do, it would basically be the end of everything. Maybe I have just been out of the loop since I do not watch the news much anymore too depressingconfusion. But this is the first I have heard of it, and my anxiety spiked when he said that he even said in the next few weeks it could happen so that did not help. Of course, google did not ease my mind any by saying, its very high risk russia will invade ukraine. So I really need some reassurance. Its all I can think about at this point.
Comments
Sometimes our minds can conjure up unhelpful or threatening thoughts. There are times when it can extrapolate a distant threat as a personal threat, that just how our mind works, and we have to accept it. So of course, it is understandable for you to feel concerned, given how much it is affected you, it is perfectly okay. If you said to yourself, this thought is not really worth paying much attention to. It does not really affect me that much right now and is not very helpful to dwell on at this moment. I am not saying you should not care about what is going on right now, but I want you to consider the situation as objectively as possible.

Hey, I am from ukraine, and you have heard the news, right? I have always been a nervous, anxious person, though I never been to a therapist and never been diagnosed with any disorder or something. But I am that guy that thinks, oh, there is a chance that I will die when taking a bus to the other city. I think I should visit a therapist with that thoughts. So I am currently living and ukraine. Nearly half of my day, I am thinking, if the war will start, and if it will, what should I do and stuff today? I heard wind hitting windows of my office, and I was like, oh shit, what was that sound? Is something happening there? All these awful thoughts keep running in my head, and I am getting tired of it.

You definitely have every right to feel this way. Its scary. Just know that you are not alone. Try to talk to others about their fears on it can affect everyone there. My mom always says to worry if worrying will help the situation. I know anxiety is not something that can be turned off. But somehow her telling me that always helps me realize that I have no control over the situation. There is nothing I can personally do, and worrying, sure as hell, will not change things just helps calm me a little bit. Hopefully it helps you too. Also, I want to tell you that here in the us, we all hope nothing happens and you are all safe. I hate that anyone has to fear the crazy country next door. It sucks

This is a special situation so I do not know if regular anxiety advice will help. Having an action plan and knowing what to do in case of an emergency is supposed to help if you think of the most safe places you know and have a plan idea about how to get there some canned food could be good to have in an emergency situation nobody really know what is going to happen but there still are a lot of possible scenarios where it is going to be alright. I really hope peace will be the best outcome for everyone

To be fair to you have a good reason to feel the way you do. You re at the center of the action, because whatever happens directly impacts you, though I do not think anything major like war will happen. News sites use those headlines to attract readers. They will hype up anything and everything for clicks.

Hey, everyone. I wanted this to be a thread of people that have maybe overcome their heart palpitations and techniques they use for me. It is the scariest party of my anxiety.

I hate them, then scare me so much so much. I have taken magnesium and potassium with little help. I have been dealing with gad and panic disorder for some time. Heart palpitations always trigger panic for me. My question is, did anyone truly overcome their heart palpitations? What techniques or strategies do you have?

Honestly, my heart palpitations only went away when I was prescribed a very low dose of a benzodiazepine as needed, which brought its own anxiety in itself, terrified of taking it too much and getting addicted, even though I might get pills every monthsconfusion. But I know that the one time every couple weeks, I get a heart palpitation. Now I can take my med and get brought down to baseline. Other than that alternating tapping of my shoulders with my arms crossed on top of my chest and sticking my tongue as hard as I can on the soft pallet of the roof of my mouth. So long as you have already verified with a doctor that there is not an underlying heart condition, I would also say there is some peace in embracing the feeling as counterproductive as it may seem, I was highly resistant to the idea of embracing the heart palpitations out of fear that I would succumb to a heart condition and die. But it was not until I was in a space that I could accept the feeling for what it was that I started to heal at all. Best of luck to you.

A few years ago, I had frequent heart palpitations that lasted about a month. It worried me enough that I went to the doctor about it, but it was determined to be stress related. I still get them from time to time, but I have found that breath work helps a lot. I have noticed that every time I have bad heart palpitations, I am either holding my breath or breathing very shallowly. They re both symptoms of the larger issue. But breathing is something I can leverage against the other symptoms. A much easier in road for me. So I started doing a body scan whenever I had a palpitation and consciously releasing my breath, focusing on the movement of my ribs. I had a mild one today. And this helped me other things that have helpetongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry, working towards a better sleep schedule. Still in progress. Lolconfusion cod, lots of therapy moving out of my mom house, removing a major stressor from my lifeconfusion. Lots of therapy and reduction of caffeine, increasing my water intake. Oh, and progressive muscle relaxation. And a proper diagnosis of my codependency and some ongoing trauma work for childhood emotional abuse in my experience, heart palpitations sucked because I did not know why I had them and felt out of control in my body working through my isms and irises, and getting the all clear from a medical doctor took the teeth out of heart palpitations for me. I still get themOccasionally but because I understand what they mean I can categorize them appropriately it does not mean anything is terribly wrong with me past being a lasting symptom of childhood trauma but it is a sign that I am overloading myself or not caring for myself properly when I am triggered avoiding triggers where possible nowadays it reminds me to take care of myself which is a good association and leads to fewer palpitations so lots of therapy lol I hope this was helpful we are all still on the journey but it does get better

I talked it over with my doctor. He made an especially long appointment for me. The main thing to remember has it killed you yet? If not, what is so special about this latest palpitation that makes it more dangerous than every one that came before it come up with an answer? Ask the question again next time and ask if your answer was right, eventually you should run out of answers or die, but the odds of that are rather slim, so the smart money is on running out of answers.

I hope you are doing okay and know that you are not alone.

Hey, everyone. I wanted this to be a thread of people that have maybe overcome their heart palpitations and techniques they use for me. It is the scariest party of my anxiety. I often have heart palpitations, pic and pacsconfusion, and they come in waves. Sometimes I get them once a day, sometimes a day. Sometimes they are strong and give me a head rush. I hate them, then scare me so much so much. I have taken magnesium and potassium with little help. I have been dealing with gad and panic disorder for some time. Heart palpitations always trigger panic for me. My question is, did anyone truly overcome their heart palpitations? What techniques or strategies do you have? I broke down because I had three in a row, and I am feeling hopeless. I do not know if it is ever going to get better, and I have a family to support. Much love to all my fellow anxiety ridden friends. Here

My heart palpitations are almost non existent since I significantly cut back on my caffeine intake.

My heart palpitations went from having a couple of weird beats a year to an every day occurrence over the course of years or so. When they got bad, they were incredibly uncomfortable and would take my breath away. They definitely got much worse with stress, but would also occur for seemingly no reason. It was not until I had all the medical heart diagnostics done with no identifiable issueconfusion that I conceded with my doctor that they were caused by anxiety. I guess the technique that worked was simply medication. My doctor put me on a low dose of lexapro, which seems to have significantly lowered the number and frequency of palpitations. I also tried buspirone, but I hated it, and it did nothing. The palpitations still come back when my anxiety really spikes, but I have kind of resigned to the fact that I have to get the anxiety in check with therapy in order to control them. Bottom line, I feel your pain, and I am so sorry, I know how debilitating and panic inducing they can be. Perhaps you could try getting heart tests done to rule out any medical conditions. It might make you feel a bit better

Sadly, nothing has helped for me either. I have tried magnesium, exercise, healthier diet ink. Why I thought that would help tbe confusion. But it is not done much. The only thing for me that actually works is just having enough sleep and cutting down stress on an average day, I will not get them. But on a day where I have little to no sleep and stress, I can get them times at this point. For me, it is a case of just living with it and trying to dig into my brain that it is normal and that many other people have it too, and it is minor, just feels weird that how I am trying to see it anyway

Wow, this is a whole thread of people just like me. My heart palpitations used to trigger my panic attacks until I got them diagnosed as pic and learned how benign they are when one happens, I just sit up and talk to my anxiety. Hey, we just had a pic. We know what that it is and that is. It is. Fine. How silly we used to be to get all worked up over it.

For me, heart palpitations are closely tied to periods when my anxiety is increasing, which will eventually lead to panic attacks. If I do not work to counteract it, they usually accompany feelings of being short of breath, even though I am actually breathing fineconfusion nausea and random pains in my body. Things that work for me when I feel these things start happening at a higher frequency, lessening my caffeine and sugar intake for awhile, increasing my exercise, which is hard at first, because it seems counterintuitive. But after only a few days of higher intensity workouts, I find that my body is using up all that excess adrenaline, and my symptoms have calmed downconfusion, ignoring any symptoms, and telling myself it is only the anxiety talking. Instead of letting myself go down, the oh, I must be dying spiral, making sure I am taking my vitamins especially, and bsconfusion and drinking more water, because even mild dehydration can cause heart palpitations.

A small tip my therapist offered, which helped, is the rule. Whenever you feel your heart racing beyond your control, close your eyes, take a deep breath in for seconds, hold it in for seconds and finally release it slowly for seconds, and do this while you are counting the seconds in your mind. Doing this times increases your oxygen intake and also relieves pressure on your heart caused by irrational anxiety. I know it might not work in severe cases, but whenever I was stuck in social situations which gave me palpitations, the exercise has helped me keep my feet on the ground, take care. Op

Telling yourself it is just your body freaking out and not an actual problem helps me I notice I freak out a lot more when I have more stress in my life I check my heart rate a lot but tried toning that down now if I have issues, I tell myself it is not real and just my body going crazy we all know it is not an actual problem deep down and reminding myself of that makes it easier I have had my heart checked before and they literally told me it is perfect.

I get really bad palpitations from stress. For me, it can be every other beat for hours or sometimes days. I went to the er during one of these episodes and they found nothing wrong. Also followed up with a cardiologist and still nothing. It does not make it any less uncomfortable, though I have medication now that helps control them, but its not something I need to take every day.

Yes, they fricken suck. But I do hear they are pretty harmless and very rare, a sign of anything serious. So that is a good thing. But I do feel the same way as far as when I have them, I instantly get anxious and panic. It really does help to know we are all experiencing these things, and we all have been told by our docs that we are good. I even went to the er and spent several hours with blood work and all for them to tell me I am ok and nothing looks wrong. Woman facepalming

As someone who has suffered with health anxiety for the past years after a sudden and harmlessconfusion heart arrhythmia, I feel like I can weigh in. My anxiety has basically been almost entirely centered around my heart, and its functioning since that day in the past year or so, I would say that not only has the number of palpitations, I get significantly decreased, but the anxiety I feel following them is practically none. It was not easy to get here, but it is totally possible. In addition to weekly talk therapy sessions with someone highly trained in cut, I found the book particularly helpful. That book has great written exercises. So what kind of exercises? Basically, it provides you templates to fill out where you write down events that bring you great anxiety for me palpitationsconfusion, and how you feel in the moment. You then identify what thought brought on the anxiety, as well as the fear that the thought represents. Personally, my core fears were dying the way that my father did. He had a stroke. Then a year later went into heart failure, but he would had fib all his lifeconfusion. You want to collect evidence that the palpitations are safe so that every time you get one, you can remind yourself that the wealth of evidence points to you being ok. It helps to also go and get heart testing done so that it definitively rules out physical explanations underlying issues. I also kept a journal where I would literally write outMy stream of consciousness whenever I would get a palpitation, it was also a place where I would write my affirmations, essentially just reminders that I was safe that the palpitations were not going to hurt me and that the evidence pointed to them being benign. All of this was in combination with regular therapy visits, where I could work through the best places to interrupt the panic thought spiral. Whenever a palpitation would happen, while you cannot always control the heart blips, you can totally exert some control over your emotional and mental responses to them. Therapy also helped me work through my grief from the death of my father, which was inextricably intertwined with my health anxiety at that point. Now, whenever I get the blips, I find it much easier to ignore them, knowing that there is no evidence they are dangerous. And I truly believe that even if I did not when I first startedconfusion this was a bit long, but I hope it helps anyone suffering. I know we health anxious types can literally agonize over every bodily sensation, but it is important to establish new thought patterns that help automate the recognition that those sensations are often completely safe.

I suffered with heart palpitations for multiple months. At first, it would happen once a day make me jolt out of my work chairconfusion. But then after a week or two of that, I began having two minute, long episodes daily. It took going to the er wearing a heart monitor for days and getting an echo me to come to terms and know that this was anxiety based for me. It went away almost as suddenly as it showed up. The one thing I did that may help you is exercise. I was always really fit and exercised a lot, but when palpitations started, I was scared to exercise at all. Rather than going all out, I did mile runs just around the block at a very slow pace. A, over time worked that up for me. Recovering from these easier runs lasted pretty much a full hours. But along with any anxiety symptoms I have, I always seem to feel better and happier after exercising. This may not work instantly when this was going on for me. I used up all my work vacation built up in a span of months. Whoever read up until here stay strong, I hardly post on reddit, but when I had this life felt terrible. I want you to know that better days are ahead. I know it is hard to believe when this is reoccurring. Even now, I still have days of chest tightness, heart burn and depression, just have to keep working at it daily. AndTry to live the way you want to despite what is going on hope this helps and was not too much of a ramble happy face smiley

I have heart palpitations daily. According to the heart monitor I wore, I had about a day. I have learned to ignore them. Its been over ten years since it started, and not a day goes by that. I do not feel them, but it does not bother me anymore. So I am just like, cool! My heart is still beating, laughing out loud.

Treat the underlying gad ad thing to keep in mind is a panic attack can start before you feel panic and sometimes do not include feelings of panic. The expression can absolutely be physical. Obviously its different for everyone. But my usual order is racing thoughts without actual panic, just anxietyconfusion, hyperventilating without noticing and then palpitations. If I do not catch it that will spiral in to a full blown panic attack. I keep a watch on the speed of my thoughts and if they are getting crazy fire up usually concentrating on my breathing body is enough to stop it before it escalates when my gad ad are well treated. This is much less of a problem with current regime. I have not had a panic attack in a few months.

Years back, I was pretty stressed out from work and a relationship going downhill and one day I began having palpitations practically every few beats that lasted over two days. It did go away but it was a nightmare, as I had not experienced that before since then I did have the full workup and nothing ever came of it on and off since then I have gotten palpitations occasionally when I am really stressed out. The past few weeks, I have been having them practically daily here and there because of major life changes. I pretty much just deal with it because the cardiologists I have seen said on their own, they will not do much besides freak you out if you fixate on it. I did have a stretch of years without any, I think for meconfusion, it is almost completely tied to stress.

I have pics, palpitations originating in the heart ventricles. I have over of these in a day. I have been dealing with this for over a year, and the method that has been working for me is radical acceptance. I have gone to the cardiologist talked with an electrophysiologist about options, and told that in all likelihood, this will not cause any harm this is coming from someone with of these a day. The path forward here is to accept that palpitations are part of your body just like a sneeze or a muscle twitch. And then address easing the fear that something may be wrong. My cardiologist looked at me and said, sometimes reassurance is enough for these to disappear in some people that has not exactly been the case with me. But I am working every day to recognize that the thoughts I get about impending doom are just that thoughts pretty powerless. Once you choose to let it go

I really wish I could offer something to help you, but I have not found anything to help. I do not have heart palpitations daily. But when I do, I automatically get launched into a panic attack and think I am going to die. I also often have one of my arms go numb when I have a panic attack, which is always fun. But when I do have heart pain or palpitations, I usually put down whatever I am doing and try to focus on my breathing, playing something soothing, like loft or rain sounds to focus on can also help as well as they can upside down, face

Have had many over the years. But what helped a lot for me was confirming with my doctor that my heart was healthy and working correctly. It took a loong time, but I keep trying not to give in to the feeling. Everytime I catch myself getting nervous because of it, I remind myself to not feed into it and to just let it go. It is harder than it seems, but it does get easier with time. I also minimize my intake of caffeine and alcohol, as those seems to make it happen more today, it is much better than what it once was. I am not cured by any means and still deal with a lot of anxiety. But it does seem to get better. Stay positive. Try your best be kind to yourself and take time to calm yourself when needed

I often have heart palpitations, pic and pacsconfusion, and they come in waves. Sometimes I get them once a day, sometimes a day. Sometimes they are strong and give me a head rush. I hate them, then scare me so much so much. I have taken magnesium and potassium with little help. I have been dealing with gad and panic disorder for some time. Heart palpitations always trigger panic for me. My question is, did anyone truly overcome their heart palpitations? What techniques or strategies do you have? I broke down because I had three in a row, and I am feeling hopeless. I do not know if it is ever going to get better, and I have a family to support.

I would not say I have truly overcome mine, but between january and about jan feb, they were quite frequent and caused me a lot of distress since early, they have diminished a fair bit in frequency. And the most obvious thing I can attribute it to and tbe this correlation does not equal. Causationconfusion is making staying hydrated a daily focus of mine. I am someone who has previously struggled with drinking enough water throughout the day. And I found that since drinking more water, the palpitations have decreased in frequency and intensity. Other things that have occurred over the last couple of years, and these may not be relevant to you at allconfusion is that I have lost about keg after getting my chronic overeating under control and reducing my junk food intake. Wishing you all the best on this difficult and painful journey

Title: I hate the weekend its giving me so much anxiety and I cant deal anymore.
Thread
Sorry. Im having really bad anxiety, so I need to vent real bad since I moved to my new appartment. I just hate the damn weekends because my neighbors are so damn loud during the weekend, its giving me so much anxiety. I dont know why it gives me anxiety. I wish I could have a normal mindset like, oh, let them have fun. Im in my own place, and ill just mind my own business, but I just cant. My whole body is shaking. I dont know why I feel anxiety and also anger. I want to knock on their door and ask them to be quiet. Its am and I want to sleep, but my anxiety is stopping me from knocking their door. I want so sleep, but I cant, because I am too focused on their noises. Im so tired. I wish I living in a house without neighbors in the middle of nowhere. Sorry for venting. But thanks for reading, I hate my brains.

Hi there. If you are not comfortable with talking to them directly, you could try contacting your landlord and see if they can give them some sort of warning. If you have any quiet hours set where you live, then there may be some action your landlord can take if it is never ending sure people like to have fun on the weekends, but in an apartment, they need to be respectful enough to keep it down hope your situation improves.

Title: My confusion swim coach commented on my self harm scars and I do not know what to
Thread
I apologize if this is off topic for this sub. I am just anxious out of my mind at the moment. Due to the lock down, I did not have swim practice for the better half of january. And despite my better judgement, I started cutting the skin on my thigh. I had failed to consider that I be returning to practice in february and soon realized that there would be no way of completely concealing the marks I left. I convinced myself that they were not all that noticeable, since I really thought that they looked like just a couple of scratches. I thought it would be fine. But then about a week ago, a girl in my swim team suddenly shouted, oh my god what happened to your leg really loudly? I quickly gave a lousy response like, oh, I have a cat who scratches at home. But that did not seem to stop her from inquiring about it more somewhat loudly, too confusion that when I suddenly hear my coach approach from behind me asking something like, who hurt their leg, then I panicked and jumped into the water and started swimming. Nothing happened that practice, and for a bit, I thought I was in the clear. I ended up skipping two practices afterward, and then yesterday I returned, thinking the whole ordeal would be forgotten. Only this time. I still had to worry about covering the scars on my thighs and some small ones on my armsconfusion, just in case when iArrived my coach greeted me kindly, mentioning how I broke my consistent no absences streak of the new year since I am kind of known for skipping frequently confusion I apologized but she brushed it off saying something like, I always happy when you do come for a moment I was happy about that and I thought that things were truly okay. But when I sat down waiting for the group before mine to finishconfusion she walked by me and asked, is your leg okay? Even when I covered my thigh with swimming equipment, I had not realized that you could still kind of see it, though, since I guess it was not completely covered. I said that it was fine. And she sort of laughed and said, it looks like you were mauled by a bear. Are you sure I was thoroughly embarrassed at this point and used the same stupid cat excuse as I did with the other girl. My coach looked at me funny and simply said, alright, and walked away. Do you think she knows that I was lying? And if so, do you think she bring it up again? Or worseconfusion email my mother, I have swim practice tomorrow morning. And I really do not know what to do. I am scared that my coach thinks that I am pathetic or an attention seeker. I am sorry for such a long post

Title: I feel like I am way too dramatic at times and I hate
Thread
I was diagnosed with anxiety at, and I feel like I have got the hang of my disorder at this point. But the worst part is my neuroticism. I have no control over how I immediately react to anything. When something happens. My brain just catastrophrzes the situation no matter how minor it is. Everything is a big deal to me, and that has constantly made me look dramatic to others. The second, the panic washes away, I realize it really was not a big deal at all. I have impulsively made a lot of bad decisions in the past, just so I can get rid of that feeling of anxiety and try to minimize a situation that did not escalate until I overreacted. I have tried everything labeling emotions, trying to rationalize my feelings, but nothing works in the moment. I feel like the world is going to end. And it feels like even at this age, I have no idea how to regulate my emotions or respond to everyday situations in a normal and less anxious manner. It genuinely feels like common sense flies out the window. The second I feel my anxiety set in, I want to be less dramatic, but it feels like my first response to anything is always panic, skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant.
Comments
If my mind jumps with a thought and the emotion that follows I will freeze and look at the reaction as something that is manufactured from past pain. My vision of it is independent of the actual thought so that I can strip it of the manufactured energy and not be consumed.

Title: Would it be ok if I went through airport security separately than my family because of my anxiety?
Thread
I posted this on amithebuttface, and people did not really understand. So I thought I would post about my situation in a community that may be a little more understanding my anxiety backstory. I have struggled with anxiety since I was a young child, and I also deal with sensory issues, and it is extremely easy for me to get overwhelmed. I also have breakdowns, which are big feelings that come with zero warning. Like that, a breakdown usually consisted either an anxiety attack or me starting to uncontrollably cry. I have flown before, but I do not remember it because I was so young, so at the end of april, I am going to hawaii with my francs family. Im just going to say my family, because I am considered to be part of the family I have been around for yearsconfusion. I have extreme anxiety when it comes to getting to hawaii. Half of that is going through security, and the other half is actually flying. I know that there is a very high chance of me having a breakdown at security. Seeing my loved ones be frisked and have their belongings searched. And having that done to myself is a terrifying thought. I decided and told my fianc that I would like to go to security, separate from them. My idea to do this was that I would lag about to minutes behind them. I told him it would be no different if I just went to the bathroom and they did notWait for me as in that amount of time, I would not be like kevin in home alone. He told me that me doing that will complicate things, and I could get lost. I said that it would be simple we could text the entire time, and if I needed help, I could ask an airport employee the reason I want to do this is so that I do not have to watch something that could potentially trigger a breakdown. And if I had a breakdown because of my frisking and search, it would be around strangers I would never see again, rather than people I know. In my original post, a lot of people thought that my fianc gets angry at me for my mental health issues. He does not and has never. He struggles with it himself. People saw this because I mentioned that he gets overwhelmed too, and he been overwhelmed can cause him to get angry by angry. I meant just grumpy and snappy, not angry at me. Hes just angry at the world and in general, and it is never directed towards anyone. So would it be ok if I lagged behind my family at the airport because of my anxiety

Title: I cannot stop thinking about russia, ukraine.

I cannot stop worrying about russia ukraine I am in the uk and literally all I have been thinking about today is that our am amp nato is going to put sanctions on russia and then we are going to get nuked in return I feel like my head is going, mah! Thinking about it and then I feel bad because I cannot even imagine the level of stress for those living in ukraine and russia.

It a political stunt to try and scare nato, for sure. Also, it might do you some good to not watch the news, at least for a little while. This kind of stuff is a gold mine for news stations to get viewership. And the bombardment of headlines on the situation do not always necessarily reflect reality. Think about it this way. If russia strikes first, they will get wiped off of the face of the earth in retaliation. There are no winners when nukes are actually used, so they are essentially relegated to a bargaining tool. Decrepit boomers use to scare people because they are going to die of old age in a few years anyway, laughing out loud,

I am in the uk too, and really cannot figure out whether I should be terrified or not. News coverage seems to veer back and forth between absolute hysteria and apparent disinterest. Like right now, the top story on be news is about curling, but then I have also seen stories which make it sound like we are bound for. I am trying to remind myself that the news is sensationalist by nature. This is not even consistently the top story there, a lot of high profile posturing going on, which probably sounds worse than it is war. Especially large scale warconfusion is good for literally nobody. Even the victors suffer. If russia launches nukes, then they will almost definitely get nuked. Because even though that entails a horrifying loss of mostly innocent life, no nation can afford to allow another to use nuclear weapons and get away with it. Is difficult to see why they would do that

I think if putin would do any sort of retaliation for sanctioning, it would have been done already. Nato has hit russia with economic sanctions for various reasons over the years and nothing has come from it atleast, to my knowledge, if they did anything, I highly doubt they would use nuclear weapons over it.

Yall are really stressed over nothing. Nobody is getting nuked. That is some bizarre scenario you make up in your minds. People living in ukraine are less stressed than you are. The media loves to conjure up pure asinine shit. Just relax.

In the uk too the chance of us getting nuked is very low. It is mutually assured destruction and doubt it would be russian response to sanctions.

It sounds like depersonalization or derealization. To me, do some googling and see if that fits. There is some resources I have really loved that I found online. Try to not stress about it too much. Brain is just doing a weird thing to keep you safe.

Inside the ear. Its probably just dry and then you scratched it too much. Definitely done this before. Don scratch it for the next few day, and it will heal and stay away from earbuds for the next few days as well.

I used to get them all the times in my teens and early they were always terrifying the momentarily feeling of doom as you gasp for air was an every few minute occurrence they eventually lessened and now I rarely get them I mostly get them when I am sick they are now more of a measure of how I am dealing with my anxiety if I can getting more frequently it means I got to reflect and exercise some self care if I get them now I try my best to avoid giving them too much attention and move on as quickly as possible now if I get multiple like you mentioned I will be attuned and the anxiety may rise but I just try to allow the feeling to pass as nothing more than that a feeling the heart is a strong and durable organ. It would take alot more than a few pals and stress to do anything damaging. I am now and day by day, I am still trying to overcome anxiety, but thankfully, the pals do not steer me near as much as they did stay strong. My friend, you can overcome it too

I have heart palpitations. When I am feeling anxious, I find straw breathing helps me. In fact, I am currently having palpitations and straw breathing. As I type this, just take a deep breath and breathe out through your mouth, puckering it as though you were blowing air out through a straw. This helps me getting the more troubling symptom of my anxiety out of the way.

Title: It is never ending.
Thread
Im constantly really anxious to the point of near breakdown. It is all the time, and it is only gotten worse recently. Certain things make it worse, too certain personality types, discussion of alcohol, hearing, footsteps, when I cannot see someone walking, etc. I also tend to worry myself a lot over hypothetical scenarios, sometimes unrealistic ones. There is never a positive thought. It is always something will go wrong, and you are the reason it will. My partner does all they can to help me. But I worry I project onto them too much, or im a lot to handle, be of how anxious I am. I want them to have fun and not be worried about me. But I feel that with my anxiety, it makes them anxious, skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant. I just want to feel ok. I just want it to stop. I want just one day where I do not feel like ive stabbed my self in the back. I almost feel like it is something more tho be. I do not have panic attacks, and if I do, they are months apart from each other and not super severe, though they have led to depressive mania before

Alcohol specifically gets me really anxious, and it is not really the factor of sobriety. I smoke every day. Sobriety is not an issue for me. My partner was in a call with someone, and I was there. They were talking about how the first time they drank, they got black out drunk and had to be carried to their bed, be they could not walk. The thought of seeing them like that really scared me, even though it is obvious they are fine. The thought of seeing them like that really scared me. It could possibly be that I have not exposed myself to it. I was the same with weed until I smoked the first time

Title: I hate the weekend its giving me so much anxiety and I cant deal anymore.
Thread
Sorry. Im having really bad anxiety, so I need to vent real bad since I moved to my new appartment. I just hate the damn weekends because my neighbors are so damn loud during the weekend, its giving me so much anxiety. I dont know why it gives me anxiety. I wish I could have a normal mindset like, oh, let them have fun. Im in my own place, and ill just mind my own business, but I just cant. My whole body is shaking. I dont know why I feel anxiety and also anger. I want to knock on their door and ask them to be quiet. Its am and I want to sleep, but my anxiety is stopping me from knocking their door. I want so sleep, but I cant, because I am too focused on their noises. Im so tired. I wish I living in a house without neighbors in the middle of nowhere. Sorry for venting. But thanks for reading, I hate my brains.

Title: When my depression gets better, my anxiety gets way worse.
Thread
My anxiety and depression have always been moderately bad, but recently, as my depression gets better, my anxiety worsens. I have been stressed about my telegram account. I tried to delete it is, and I have no clue if it worked. I am also super anxiety ridden about school. I have no idea what to do.
Comments
I know this sounds awful, but it is totally normal. Choose which one bothers you most try to work out that personally, for me, it is my anxiety. Finding my triggers. Sometimes I cannot, but describing the situation, the severity, etc. All helps me to calm down. And I hope eventually I can find a pattern, do things you think will help it all. A learning process and stress and anxiety ridden about school is so common but so difficult. Maybe try a positives list. I hope this helps a bit.

Most common for me is nausea, sweat, freezing cold hands and feet and stomach problems. I used to throw up a lot, but this symptom went away. After high school, I will occasionally feel faint, get chest pain, heart burn, get a headache, get a fast heartbeat, my least common symptoms are fainting, only if I am really freaked out. Usually about other physical painconfusion and panic attacks lucky to only have had in my life that I could call panic attack, rather than my regular highly anxious state confusion, I hope you are doing alright today.

Mostly stomach issues. My panic attacks usually start as a hot flash, like feeling break out into a sweat, and then the diarrhea comes on suddenly. If I have to go do anything important, I take xanax and imodium beforehand. Sometimes, if I am just generally feeling nervous, it will make my back ache, I guess, from the tension.

Going through an anxious episode at the moment I will mention the lesser, talked about ones brain zaps body jolts when trying to relax. Bizzare images when I close my eyes, sometimes little to no sex drive, overwhelming urge to google my symptoms, existential thoughts with dread, digestive issues, intense hunger, then loss of appetite, regardless of when and how much I ate. Intense loneliness, even when around people a desire to sleep nap, but not being able to, a pressure between my eyes and top of nose, urge to cry, but not being able to hypervigilence from the moment of waking weird ass dreams, liquid ass and curly poop, an obsession with trying to figure out whats wrong. An obsession with trying to find something that will instantly make me feel better, dry mouth, not being comfortable in my own body, a weight on my chest, it always gets better, and the symptoms melt away. Eventually, in a week or so, I will tell me self. Wif! Was that all about

Stop trying to validate yourself through the eyes of other. You are good enough. They way you are, do what you want, say what you want. Some people are going to like you, some will not.

Title: How do you make yourself take action when you are paralyzed by anxiety?
Thread
Part of my job involves reaching out to my roster of clients at least once or twice a month I have a handful of clients who I have fallen behind on keeping in touch with and have not had contact in a few months. Every day, I tell myself I need to just sit down and send them all a quick message checking in, and every day I get too overwhelmed by how much time has passed, and I do not do it. Logically, I know it does not make sense and that it is only getting worse the more I put it off. But I truly feel paralyzed every time I try to take care of it. Gotten to the point where I am literally waking up in the dead of night, terrified I am going to be fired. And yet I cannot seem to make myself try to fix the situation. This is just the current example of how my anxiety paralyzes me. But I have been dealing with this in other areas of my life for years and years. Does anybody have any suggestions

Title: Im so fucking lost twconfusion
Thread
Okay, so I have been previously diagnosed with adhd depression. Heres the story in shortconfusion. I used to have a lot of stuff goin on in my life. I used to think it brought me stress as a completely normal reaction. My life is going great now, except, im not fucking confusing. Figured out that I was anxious. I feel anxious the entire time, and it is killing me, making me nauseous, have a high heart rate, etc. Making it hard to function, went to the doctor. She told me that I indeed might have anxiety and wrote me a letter to be allowed to have meds if my psychiatrist wants to prescribe those. The bad thing right now is I used to be prescribed adhd meds, elvanseconfusion, and they used to somehow numb my body, which helped the anxiety in a way now, im not getting those anymore either help, just raw, dogging life and waiting, even when I feel better. For a few hours. At most, my brain instantly overthinks about that aswell, are you maybe just overreacting? See, you are fine now, and it just fuels me to be even more self destructive, so I can feel bad, weird, right? Yeah, maybe it is because it gives me a good feeling, not caring about anything I have tried weed and alcohol and have been prescribed multiple adhd meds. Never hard drugs. Now I am having a hard time, staying off of drugs, even though I have never had them before. And it isReally difficult for me to understand why I feel addicted to something I have never had. Please help. Im so confused with myself and feel as if my feelings are not valid or too mild to complain about and that im just pretending.

My health over the years was at my highest weight of. After the er, I made drastic changes got on zoloft started eating better, etc. For most of that year, I felt great. Currently, I have lost nearly pounds, sitting at pounds. However recently, things have taken a turn for the worst worse than it has ever been. All of a sudden my anxiety is at an alltime high. My arms, shoulders, chest and legs are always tense. Any little bit of movement or effort results in my muscles shaking. I feel weak fatigued headaches, trouble sleeping. Anything physically exerting sends me into a panic attack I tried working out recently and minutes in I had a massive one. Even if I am not feeling anxious, I still have all these symptoms, and I am having them every single day. I was at the doctor for my checkup not even months ago, and my blood work, etc. Was fine. But now, with all these physical symptoms, I am convinced in those months, I have gotten some kind of cancer or horrible disease. As I am typing this, my arms are shaking, just from holding the phone. It, like all the progress from this last year is gone. Zoloft feels like I am taking water pills. I have been in a constant stateOf worry to the point I cannot function day to day, I will admit, for the past or months, I have not been exercising nearly as much, which, of course, has me worried even more.

Sounds like your sympatic nervous system is in overdrive, hence the muscle tension. Sometimes the mind and body are not connected too. You can feel entirely fine, but your body is super anxious tense, hence the symptoms I have been there. You need a doctor, someone to talk to and get therapy. Just popping pills is not a long term solution. For many, you ve done an amazing job already with the weight loss. Exercise can help with anxiety, too, helps body to be up and about when needed and then relax after getting your heart rate up the healthy way. But you need professional help to get you out of those disease scares you keep having

You should go talk to your doctor. Sometimes your medication dosage needs to be adjusted after a period of time. You may also want to go to your go because some of your symptoms sound like what I have read.

My anxiety usually worsens the depression, although the anxiety is almost constant, the depression used to be until I got medicated. Also a couple of times, I got so depressed and just did not care anymore about anything. And the anxiety vanished. But for advice, I would say, either get medicated, do a shit ton of exercise or mediate. There are other options besides that, but that is what works best for me.

Hello. This is my first time posting on reddit. So I am sorry if I make any mistakes. I do not really know why I am posting, but here we go. I have been experiencing anxiety since september in september, I experienced a panic attack for the first time. I had no idea what was happening to me. I really thought I was dying, I was shaking, hyperventilating. My heart was racing so fast I had chest pains and I could not catch my breath. It was scary, and it went on for what felt like ages. I thought it was a once off experience. I started having panic attacks on and off for the next while. After having a bad one in public at my part time job, I decided I needed to quit. I thought the answer to my problem was to stop juggling both work and college. Yay! Less stress, no more anxiety. I thought wrong. I soon referred myself to get counselling sessions through my college. I did enjoy my sessions. It was nice having the chance to say whatever was on my mind to a complete stranger. If you are still reading, I think you might have guessed I do like to ramble. So talking was the easy part, confusion. However, I still felt like I was getting nowhere. I went to see my doctor a few times. I got put on some medication for anxiety. This did not last too long. I started getting sleep paralysis after taking them confusionAnd I got referred to go do cut cognitive behavioural therapyconfusion. I am still attending the cut sessions currently, and I feel that they are going well, I like the idea of having solutions. I have not had a panic attack since before christmas. There are still days. I feeling like I am choking and like I could die before I fall asleep, I sometimes feel dizzy, like I could collapse any second. Other times my chest tightens, or it feels like there is some kind of cloud hovering in there. These past weeks, I have been experiencing physical pain. I have pains in my chest, in my side and in my back. Everytime I take a breath, no matter what I do, they will not go away. It been really hard for me. I have always been a bubbly, happy, go, lucky person. I even made my doctor, my counsellor and my therapist laugh and smile along the way. However, suddenly, getting anxiety has been quite upsetting and very frustrating. I am grateful to have my family, friends and boyfriend who support me through all this, I am actually very lucky to have the life I have. I have a fantastic support network. I am getting through my final year of college, and I cannot wait to work in the career I have chosen. I am enjoying life, and yet I still experiencing anxiety, and I really do not know why anymore. I wish it would just disappear for good anyways. Thank you for readingThrough all this if you did not that is okay too, because I really did ramble on a bit confusion. I just really needed to talk about this whole process as I am still trying to figure it out to anyone who is experiencing anxiety no matter how mild or severe my heart goes out to you it really is tough, but I do hope we can continue to get by happy face or smiley.

I have had this experience with coffee. I recommend having someone you trust there with you. It helps a lot. Thats only if you are comfortable with it. Grab something that soothes you a texture, someone thing that gets your mind focused. I have trouble getting my brain to stop sending constant messages and thoughts on repeat. If that happens, I try to look at the object and break it down into components, thinking about how it is made and thinking, how do I fix the object back to normal? Its kind of like a puzzle.

Close your eyes and transport yourself to a time or a moment where you felt good since you had this good moment once, then you are capable to have it again. Eventually, anxiety will pass and you will look back and clearly see thats what it was.

Title: I was prescribed fluoxetine but I do not think I am going to take
Thread
I finally talked to a doctor about having anxiety, but I am not depressed. I really do not feel comfortable taking an sri, but I did not want to say anything and make them think I was questioning their judgment. They said they were not going to prescribe benzodiazepines because I said I did not have panic attacks, but I think an sri is kind of extreme, considering the very high likelihood of experiencing negative side effects, I do not want to be anxious, but I also want to enjoy my life when the weather is nice. I like to hang out outside with my friends and smoke weed, legal stateconfusion and or take mushrooms, and I would not be able to do that on this medication. It stays in your system for a long time, too. Edit. Another concern I have about sis is how often they cause sexual dysfunction for patients. I guess I am just trying to figure out if it is really worth it for me to take this. I do not want to create multiple other problems for myself that will interfere with my relationships.

Just took my first my propranolol this morning. I was very anxious to try it, and after minutes, I felt the effects. My heart rate went down, and my body feels less tense. Honestly, I would give it a shot. It does not block the mental aspect of anxiety, but definitely settles down the physical symptoms, which makes you feel less anxious.

I was bullied in highschool for two years. I mean, in a having lunch at the bathroom stall, bullied. It started from a rumor, which leads to everybody hating me.

Title: Please spare some helpful words if you can. This anxiety is sucking the life out of me.
Thread
Hey, I do not know if this is the right place to post this, but I am open to getting redirected to a more suitable subreddit. I am a year old, and I still live with my parents for financial but mostly cultural reasons, and I can safely say their parenting has left me scarred for life. My father has avoidant personality disorder, and my mother has anxiety, clinical depression and bipolar disorder. And along with me being the oldest daughter, it has truly messed me up to get to the point. I do not have generalised anxiety, but in certain situations, ones inevitably related to my parents acting up in one way or another. I get really bad anxiety to the point where I cannot function. So for example, I was just out visiting a friend house after university today, and my mother said something to me on text that flared my anxiety, and before I know it, I am fidgety and anxious, and I cannot enjoy my time out. I kept overthinking for when I would get home and was scared for her reaction. This has really affected my life, because my mother does not like me going out, and everytime I go out anywhere, she gets really mad at me and says something that triggers me and its hell all over again and try as I may, I cannot ignore it. This also means that everytime I go out, even without her knowledge and her messages, I get mild to moderate anxiety byDefault is there anything else I can do perhaps a breathing exercise or even just general advice that you think would help I am desperate for anything really
Comments
That must be so scary having to live with parents that can trigger anxiety do you have any hobbies that can distract you also if it is a panic episode wherein you feel out of control I recommend meditation it has somehow helped me I just repeat a random word in my head and as intrusive thoughts pass by I just go back to the word allow the breathing to just come in naturally for the long term I personally remind myself that this thing I am going through is only temporary and the anxiousness will not last forever hope this helps

Title: Breathing from a oxygen bottle worsens anxiety.

Hey guys. So I found out that I have oxygen deficiency and I decided to get myself a litre bottle with oxygen I have been struggling with breathing for a long time and it feels as if I am breathing for the first time but at the same time my anxiety gets immediatly worse and I feel like I am only a step away from a full blown panic attack. Did anyone else experience this
Comments
No. Are you working with a doctor? Have you been diagnosed with an oxygen deficiency? It not a good idea to get your own oxygen tank and breathe it without a doctor guidance. You can actually do some damage depending on what the oxygen mix is.

They have a medical interaction, not a moral one. Xanax does not care whether you have had a drink. What matters is your remaining blood, alcohol content. The interaction can be dangerous, so you should stick to safety rules about how long to separate drinking from medication, and what your maximum amount to drink in a session is, I think the healthiest approach is to do your homework, understand the basic biochemistry, set up rules for yourself and ask your pharmacist or prescribed to check your work for most people. It takes between one and two hours to detoxify a single drink. So if you have two beers, you will be completely sober within hours and safe to take meds. But if you have six or eight standard drinks, sleep restlessly for a few hours, and then take anxiety meds that could be dangerous. Good argument to not drink heavily. Basically, the approach I take with anxiety is to do the best I can and then let it be there some danger here to be worried about, but you can manage it. And again, the medical professionals are supposed to make sure that you are able to take your meds safely. So asking them to check your work and correct misunderstandings is okay.

For me, it is not a shaking sensation, more like a quick, sharp shift to the left and right. And then it is done. I have problems with anxiety, but do not connect the two.

Minimize social media in your life. Deleting facebook was one of the best things I did for my mental health. Also, maybe consider abstaining from alcohol. It makes anxiety much worse. I have been sober for almost a decade. That is the best thing I have ever done for my mental health.

Yes, social media is a big cause of anxiety, especially for people who cannot differentiate peoples online. Life is real life to fix the drunk story posting. Just put your phone in your purse and do not take it out. If you find yourself wanting to take videos and pictures, use your camera. You can look at the pictures you took the next morning. Just do not go on, ig or snap. I found that helps me be. I used to be so embarrassed after a night out, everything else you are just going to have to change your mind. Set, dont judge yourself off of what people online. Think of you post what you want because it makes you happy.

Lorazepam and xanax alprazolamconfusion are part of the same family of medications the benzodiazepines, there are a ton of others within the same family that you have probably even heard of before valium klonopin etcconfusion. These are incredibly effective at treating panic attacks, but they are all come with a serious risk of addiction and are not meant for consistent use. They truly are meant for emergency situations. These are the types of meds that would be administered in the er if you presented with what was deemed a panic attack, I do not know your situation. But if anxiety is a consistent life altering problem in your life, it may be worth considering an sri. Doctors tend to be very careful with handing out prescriptions for benzos because it could cause addict and harm their patient and or get them in some serious trouble. Technically speaking, you should not drive after taking benzos as their job is to completely surprise your central nervous system and your brain. So after taking the medication, your reaction times will be slower. They work on similar receptors in the brain as alcohol. So it is sort of like taking the relaxation from alcohol, but removing the full blown intoxication, nausea, etc. Theres some evidence that hydroxide is relatively effective at treating anxiety on an as needed basis without the risk of addiction. If you have ever taken benadryl or another type of allergy medicine, this is typically the ingredient that makes people feel sleepy. So in theory, being sleepy.Is better than being anxious.

Xanax think twice. Yes, it works but very addictive and the withdrawal is living hell. Lorazepam had decent experience with this for gad wasn real bad to wean off of klonopin, just started taking when really anxious, and it helps but is very sedating. I very sensitive to medsconfusion was given a prescription of my pills and have consumed half of one twice in the past days. As I do not want to get addicted. With all of these, you need to first learn how they effect you. If they make you drowsy at all, you should not drive

Just took my first my propranolol this morning. I was very anxious to try it, and after minutes, I felt the effects. My heart rate went down, and my body feels less tense. Honestly, I would give it a shot. It does not block the mental aspect of anxiety, but definitely settles down the physical symptoms, which makes you feel less anxious.

I have ativan as needed, but it is really only for intense panic attacks, not my daily gad symptoms. When I take it, I know that I cant drive or work for a few hours be. It makes me feel tired. It does help, though. For generalized anxiety disorder, I suggest cod, depending on where you live, you can get it without a prescription. I didnt like any of the daily antidepressants I tried. They all had side effects and made no noticeable changes. Cod has not given me any side effects and helps both the physical and mental symptoms. Gummies are not strong enough for me, so I use tincture

Xanax is great for emergency need but from personal experience it has to be a emergency or it does not help if your on the fence of you need something in that very moment or not I have found it does not help in those situations also it makes me feel drunk and very tired for hours the others I am not sure I have never been prescribed them

My no sent me hydroxizine, mgconfusion and propranolol, mgconfusion, but none of them worked for my anxiety attacks. They are too mild for me. Propranolol is a beta blocker. It does not treat the psychological effects, but rather the physiological effects. It is supposed to lower your heart rate, but you will still feel the anxiety. For me, it kicks in about to hours. Hydroxizine is an antihistamine that is supposed to help with anxiety. I take it just because is the only medication available to me, but I do not feel it working also, I do not like how antihistamines make me feel either

If you need fast relief, xanax or ativan would be your best bet. I was prescribed klonopin once, and it took too long to kick in for me. And then I was a zombie for the rest of the day. But everyone is different.

I have got a lorazepam prescription but I am really careful with benzos because I do not want to end up getting addicted if you are afraid of addiction I can recommend seroquel. I also have some it was prescribed to me because it has really strong calming properties and is essentially a sedative so it helps a lot during panic attacks or emotional outbursts like I used to have back then lorazepam is basically seroquel but it does not make you feel all sleepy and drunk and high, so it makes you feel good and maybe a little stupid. Its pretty nice

I take propranolol. It is mild enough that it does not affect my day to day activities, but definitely helps with the physical symptoms. I only take them as and when required, and if I need to take one, it has usually kicked in within mins.

Title: I was prescribed fluoxetine but I do not think I am going to take
Thread
I finally talked to a doctor about having anxiety, but I am not depressed. I really do not feel comfortable taking an sri, but I did not want to say anything and make them think I was questioning their judgment. They said they were not going to prescribe benzodiazepines because I said I did not have panic attacks, but I think an sri is kind of extreme, considering the very high likelihood of experiencing negative side effects, I do not want to be anxious, but I also want to enjoy my life when the weather is nice. I like to hang out outside with my friends and smoke weed, legal stateconfusion and or take mushrooms, and I would not be able to do that on this medication. It stays in your system for a long time, too. Edit. Another concern I have about sis is how often they cause sexual dysfunction for patients. I guess I am just trying to figure out if it is really worth it for me to take this. I do not want to create multiple other problems for myself that will interfere with my relationships.

I have been on an sari for years, and it has been amazing. It took me a little bit to find the most effective dose, but now it is really helpful with my baseline anxiety. There are some that are really pretty mild. When I started lexapro, I was not even sure it was working at first, but then my family told me they could see a change. And after about a month, I felt more capable of doing things. I wanted to not to say they are for everyone, but for me, they where well worth the mild side effects.

I was watching to a show. I really like I was not doing anything else and I really do not think anything triggered it. I just started to feel really anxious, and I had to turn the to off, and I could not stay still. I was pacing for an hour, and I could not really breathe, right? Everything I looked at made me more anxious for no reason, and everything felt so loud. I ended up calming down when I went outside and laid in the snow for a while, I looked it up, and it really did not seem like an anxiety attack. All the websites said, you will not really be able to breathe. You are sweating and you may be feeling like you are dying stuff like that. I did not really feel that way. It felt a lot less intense than what they are describing. I thought I would post here, what do you think

Title: So we know seeking relief from anxiety is bad because it reinforces the anxiety. But biologically speakingconfusion, why do I feel relief when I do something to avoid the anxiety?
Thread

Comments
I am not sure if I am understanding you correctly, but if I am the answer is really simple. You feel relief because you avoided the thing that caused you anxiety. Imagine tens of thousands of years ago when your ancestors were living in a jungle and they saw a tiger that would cause them anxiety, so they would hide from the tiger, and the tiger would go away, and then they would feel relief because the tiger is gone and they are safe. Our brains have not changed from that time, so our anxiety still works the same way.

One thing that has helped me is being on a stimulant, im prescribed one for adhdconfusion. I take a few meds that can lower libido and make it harder to orgasm. And when I do not take my stimulants, I do notice those side effects become much more prominent, whereas on the stimulant, I do have a libido and can orgasm. The only thing is, I am not sure if prescribing stimulants for this problem is a thing. So to speak, stimulants are known to give some people sexual side effects every once in a while. A highly upvoted me will appear on reddit about how adderall makes you super hornyconfusion. But I do not know how common it is for doctors to prescribe stimulants for that reason. And stimulants can exacerbate anxiety. In some people, they do not for me and I also have gad, but I have known some people with the dual adhd gad diagnoses that cannot take stimulants. The nice thing about stimulants, though, is that they work almost immediately. So ideally, you would not have to take one every day only as needed when you wanted to edited to add a couple thingsconfusion.

Ever since I was a kid, whenever I get stressed or feel tense, I start blinking uncontrollably and my eyes dart back and forth. I have been doing it so long. I forget I do it, and I get weird looks and questions from people in a way I kind of like how it feels. It is a way of feeling better during those stressful situations. And it helps me cope. I have had other things that come and go as well, but the blinking has always stuck with me just apart of who I am. I suppose I have never got it checked out or anything, because I feel like I would be wasting people time

I am under a lot of stress lately and I have developed this habit in the last months. It is driving me crazy any advice.
Comments
Yes, its the worst. I also pick my lip an anxiety habit that I have had my entire life. One thing that helps a little for me is keeping my nails short to minimize the damage. I also doodle simple shapes over and over. If I am anxious and have a pen and paper with me, you could even try a fidget toy to keep your hands busy when you are stressed. Good luck.

Title: I went to the er thinking that I was having a heart attack, but it was actually a really bad panic attack.
Thread
This happened a couple of weeks ago I was at work, and a sudden point I started to feel like my heart was beating out of my chest and was going really fast. I never felt so bad in my life. My arm started to hurt, and my neck felt like someone stabbed it. I rushed to the er, and when I was waiting to be called, my symptoms got worse. I told them to one of the techs, and he told me to go knock on the door of the nurses and tell them I told to the nurses, and they got concerned. They put me an oxygen mask, then they got some blood and injected me a medication that I did not know what it was. They put me in a room where I had heath monitors. And then after a couple of hours, my health rate went down almost back to normal. The doctor came in and told me that I had no signs of health attack, and the blood work was all normal. So she said that it could have ben a health attack. And also I needed to drink more water. This is the time that happened, and I am starting to get tired of it. Thank you for reading.

Don feel bad. I have done the same felt like my life was in danger. So I called an ambulance just a panic attack, waste of thousands of dollars. But just remember, every time this happens, you will be fine.

Hey, man, I get it. Im getting real tired of this anxiety bullshit. I always swear there is something wrong in my body. But what helped me over come? This was thinking, logically, I get blood work and physicals done often. I always say to myself, think, logically, you are healthy. This is ur anxiety. I say this over in my head while practicing breathing exercises, ink if it works for other people. But this works for me. I havent been getting as many attacks lately. Good luck, friend.

Title: Throat stuck pill feeling for months on end.

I have been having this feeling as if there is a pill stuck in my throat for probably around year. Now I went to a doctor for it, and he said that I am all healthy. I do have anxiety. And the little research I did lead me to globes, which is this throat feeling, and its related to anxiety. I tried some things, but none helped anyone else in the same situation as me.

I had that symptom for about weeks and it is horrible. I barely ate and lost a lot of weight drinking cold water and sucking on cough lozenges helped, but I mainly had to convince myself it was just anxiety, and eventually it went away.

Title: Getting increasingly harder to ignore recent suicidal thoughts urges.
Thread
After the start of an ongoing depressive episode, my depression and anxiety has reserved me to the point of having virtually no support system for conquering my social anxiety and having a semi prosperous life. At some point, my life pulled a complete. In recent years, as I have become entirely docile and devoid of personality. My now ex girlfriend, sister and roommate, who I consider to be my best friend, are examples of those who have confronted about how dull and lacking of personality I am and talk badly about me because of it, while already knowing how severe my depression is. As I am essentially friendless. As a senior in college, the roommate, previously mentioned, only lives with me out of pity and knowing I do not have the finances and resources to live elsewhere. I have concluded that I have been struggling from what I believe to be depersonalization and have yet to relieve my symptoms. Despite my bi weekly therapist visits and copious amounts of medication, I am highly considering ending my life before turning this year

Title: I was prescribed fluoxetine but I do not think I am going to take
Thread
I finally talked to a doctor about having anxiety, but I am not depressed. I really do not feel comfortable taking an sri, but I did not want to say anything and make them think I was questioning their judgment. They said they were not going to prescribe benzodiazepines because I said I did not have panic attacks, but I think an sri is kind of extreme, considering the very high likelihood of experiencing negative side effects, I do not want to be anxious, but I also want to enjoy my life when the weather is nice. I like to hang out outside with my friends and smoke weed, legal stateconfusion and or take mushrooms, and I would not be able to do that on this medication. It stays in your system for a long time, too. Edit. Another concern I have about sis is how often they cause sexual dysfunction for patients. I guess I am just trying to figure out if it is really worth it for me to take this. I do not want to create multiple other problems for myself that will interfere with my relationships.

I mean do what you are comfortable with but sis are aging for anxiety treatment not just depression I take an sri and have been on it for years and it literally saved my life I took medication in conjunction with therapy and so my depression is well managed and could probably be managed without meds at this point but I continue taking the meds for anxiety now I have gad and ocdconfusion when medicated my anxiety symptoms are reduced at least like from debilitating to very manageable I have an re for benzos too but frankly they are only for emergencies like if I am having a severe panic attack or something one re of pills can last me well over a yearconfusion I understand why your doctor will not prescribe them because they have a high potential for physical dependency and abuse and they can cause rebound anxiety symptoms ink it is all just to say maybe sis are not the right choice for you but keep an open mind when weighing the pros and cons of treatment with antidepressants

Some sari meds work for some people. Some do not. It is hard to know. Ultimately, it is your choice to take them or not personally. None have worked for me. Some made me tired, some made me feel nauseous, but did not help with my anxiety. But I know people who have taken ones. I tried and say, it changed there. Life about the sexual side effects. The only one I took that made me just not in the mood was lexapro. Other then that nothing I would have a discussion with your doc and just let them know your concerns.

Title: Felt super anxious for an hour for no reason. Was this an anxiety attack?
Thread
I was watching to a show. I really like I was not doing anything else and I really do not think anything triggered it. I just started to feel really anxious, and I had to turn the to off, and I could not stay still. I was pacing for an hour, and I could not really breathe, right? Everything I looked at made me more anxious for no reason, and everything felt so loud. I ended up calming down when I went outside and laid in the snow for a while, I looked it up, and it really did not seem like an anxiety attack. All the websites said, you will not really be able to breathe. You are sweating and you may be feeling like you are dying stuff like that. I did not really feel that way. It felt a lot less intense than what they are describing. I thought I would post here, what do you think

Title: Constant social media, anxiety and fear of getting cancelled.
Thread
For context I have diagnosed gad I tend to fixate on something and become incredibly anxious. And right now, it is what is in the title I was a young teenager around, and I definitely said and did some stupid things on socials or through message nothing super horrible or anything like that. But sometimes I worry that someone will go back into messages with me and try to use something I said when I was like or out of context and cancel me. For instance, I worry my message threads with someone are saved to their icloud and are permanently tied to me. Its hard for me to go back through my messages and check what I said to alleviate my stress, because I cleared my inboxes frequently and never really backed up my messages. I have significantly pulled back from social media in my adult years because I became aware of its permanence. I do not post a lot. Ive unfollowed or removed a ton of people. I generally do not share my businessconfusion, and it scares me I want to have a career as an educator or maybe start a music tiktok. Ive had profs and friends say I should release my musicconfusion. But this crippling fear holds me back. I know it is rooted in a bad experience I had with an ex who made social media accounts to try and slander me with false or exaggerated statements two years after our break up. But I live in constant fear for theOther shoe to drop for someone to want to start drama or ruin my life, even if ive done nothing to them. What is the likelihood or this happening? What is the likelihood of someone having messages with me from that many years ago? Does anyone have any advice on how to overcome this crippling fear? It is been bothering me for weeks.

I had this too. And what worked for me is deleting the socials I had when I was younger and more foolish. Then deleting my snap instagram I find kind of is not built in a way that allows really edgy content, except for the storiesconfusion. So I find that less stressful. Obviously, I am basically telling you to break off from an addictive activity, but just not being reminded of social media all of the time helps me a lot.

I am the same exact way, realistically, it is very unlikely but not impossible. Chances are that it will not happen unless you get a lot of attention. If you do decide to post on tiktok, I would recommend using a fake name and not showing your face if possible, not just because of this anxiety, necessarily, but because I think it is good to have privacy online.

Title: I have tried everything but I am not getting better.
Thread
I am pretty desperate. At this point, its been about months since I started feeling bad, about months since I had to leave work and give up on all my commitments. I have been having horrible, physical symptoms that the doctors think is anxiety. Things like stomach ache, tingling, numbness, nausea, fatigue, chest pain, congestion. The list goes on. Its constant, and I am terrified that its something sinister. But the doctors brush it off as anxiety, because I have had a blood test that came back normal, and because my pain is not severe, I have had anxiety most of my life, but it is never affected my body this much, which is why I feel so confused and scared about what is wrong with me. I have weekly therapy, I on antidepressants. At a high doseconfusion, I take vitamins and probiotics. I go to the doctors fairly often, I dont have any commitments that could be stressing me out. I keep trying to journal or do little things to feel normal, but I just do not feel any better. Nothing is helping. I feel like im just waiting for things to get better, but they aren. Does anyone have any experience or advice with something like this? I feel so lost.

Comments
Yes, social media is a big cause of anxiety, especially for people who cannot differentiate the difference of peoples online life is real life. To fix the drunk story posting, just put your phone in your purse and do not take it out. If you find yourself wanting to take videos and pictures, use your camera. You can look at the pictures you took the next morning. Just do not go on ig or snap. I found that helps me be. I used to be so embarrassed after a night out, everything else you are just going to have to change your mind. Set, dont judge yourself off of what people online think of you post what you want because it makes you happy.

He asked me whether she must take insulin or not, and I think I said not. Then he asked me whether to give her lunch or not, to be honest, I am not sure. So I told that let her eat some food but not too much cus we do not want her sugar to spike. She is diabeticconfusion. Then my dad went, and I immediately googled what to do. Google, said, give carbs and avoid fats. So now instead of checking on what they were giving her, I just thought, meh, whatever id and continued my life. I later went down and told my dad to check her sugar again to make sure it is not gone too up high. She was ok by the end of the day. A month later, I remembered this and thought, why did not. I tell my dad not to giveHer fatty food? Was it because I wanted her to die as horrible as it sounds? It is true. I want our lives to become normalconfusion, and if it was because I wanted her to die, does that make it attempted murder? I feel terrible. I do not want to kill her. I do not want to hurt her or anyone, but I cannot get over the guilt.

As a law student, if I had to pick this apart on a test, I would start with the not wanting to kill her to argue it is not attempted murder, lacked depraved mind. Also, not telling your dad did not seem like an intentional omission and an act has to be intentional to give rise to criminal responsibility. There are some exceptions this is not oneconfusion, like I really could not make the argument this was attempted murder.

I definitely do not think it is attempted murder, but maybe getting close to disregard for her safety. Even then you told them to monitor her blood sugar, which is probably the most important. Just sounds like you really do not care about her, and that is not for anyone else. To judge from my perspective, you do not want to help her, but it does not sound like you are trying to kill her.

I have been invited to another party tonight. And while I know I would have fun if I went, I know that my social battery is pretty low at the moment and would really rather just stay at home. I am at a loss, because I really like this group of people and I always have fun with them, and I know they would be happy if I was there, but I do not want to drain myself or compromise. A night of alone time. Am I being a loser for staying at home? Should I leap at every social opportunity I get with my friends? Homo has always been an issue that I struggle with. Thanks. So for your help.

Less I do. I actually I have been like this since last year. I even went to the er and did a it and an mri, but they found nothing serious. It never went away. And I just started on anxiety meds, so I hope they start getting better. Also, just wanted to add that when I did the it, I was awake, and they told there was a lot of pressure in the head and the neck area. I had no clue how they saw it and thought nothing about it. But when I did the mri, which I was sedated in, they did not see that pressure. The doctor told me it was because I was awake and anxious when they did the it anxiety is just the worstfrown sad, angry or pouting

Anxiety really can have a crippling affect on the body. It can last for a good few months or longer if you do not get it under control. Poor sleep, stress, lack of exercise, bad diet and avoidance can cause prolonged symptoms. Youd be surprised just how powerful the mind is. Anxiety can absolutely affect you physically.

And any of these symptoms can worsen depending on triggers like poor sleep and stress. I mean, it is been many months since I have experienced the panic attack type feeling. But maybe the anxiety evolved into this. Does anyone have a similar experience?

This is exactly what I have had it for years. Dosent seem to get any better. The wavelike dizziness, like on a boatconfusion is the worst.

I have had about months of random symptoms. I have had tests, but the doctors keep putting it down to anxiety. I have suffered with anxiety for most of my life, including suffering physically because of it, but recently, its been at its worst tingling, numbness, chest pain, stomach pain, congestion, none of it debilitatingly painful, but it is constant and stops me doing most things. If this is anxiety, I would be very impressed at its ability to affect my body. Its almost unbelievable to think that anxiety and stress can do this, but I am starting to think it can, and that it is way more powerful than people think. I really hope you feel better soon.

Do benzos cause any permanent side effects I am not going to be abusing them. I just need them for anxiety and panic attacks. I am really mostly scared of the erectile dysfunction and loss of libido side effects, and I mean like side effects that stay even after you stop taking them. I plan on taking them for months, maybe times a week, hopefully less only going to use them when my panic attacks hit.

Almost constant chest pain, jumping eyelid, cold, and hands. Legs higher blood pressure when anxious. But sometimes, as I feel strong chest pain, the blood pressure is. So my nervous system really want me to think about my heart laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses. Also, the pain sometimes go to left arm. Its like I can control where the pain goes. If I really try to calm down, I even can get the pain go away, so its gettin better.

Title: Been struggling a lot with anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and do not know what to do about them.
Thread
They started out a while ago. Basically, I just keep having intrusive thoughts about imaginary situations that anger and stress me out. They involve things like me living with abusive parents and the situations that come with that or me being accidentally rude to people and hurting their feelings. And a lot more, most of these thoughts come from things that I do not like child abuse and social anxiety. These thoughts have been severely effecting me and my parents when I have a thought, I always get really mad due to the contents of the thoughts and how I would hate to be in that situation. So when I experience a thought, I have a physical reaction, like making a sudden movement or saying something to myself like, shut up or okay. That is enough. I am going to go drink water now and then not doing that, all of these end up concerning my parents a lot because I look like I am going crazy when I just randomly spit out something like, okay, leave me alone when I am alone in my room. But that is just the easy part. I always have thoughts about arguing with people about stuff, and I always end up arguing with them in real life too. As in, I would be experiencing a thought in my brain, and I would physically speak to myself in real life, with the thoughts and argue with them. And this also has scared my family a lot, because I would justBe sitting there sometimes even with them in the car, and I would just start talking to myself angrily. Days ago, I was sitting in my room and drawing. I was having some extremely uncomfortable, intrusive thoughts, and I just could not take it anymore. So I stood up and sure ed, from the top of my lungs, witch terrified my parents and made my mother cry, and I do not know what to do. Now, I already went to therapy last year for a possible ocd diagnosis and took erp. But at the end, therapist said I did not have it. I want to go there again, but my parents will not let me, because they do not want me to think I have another disorder. I tried looking up stuff online. The most common way to stop anxiety. Intrusive thoughts is through ignoring the thought and not engaging with it and essentially desensitizing yourself to it. But I simply cannot stop engaging and arguing with these thoughts without zoning out and forgetting about it. I heard that maybe trying to ignore them for a certain time, like, minutes, for example, would help, but I am yet to try that, like I do not know what to do now. I have to study, but I cannot do that properly, and sometimes I cannot even pay attention in class, and my parents are losing their minds, and it is effecting their physical health, too. Maybe I should look up more reddit threads of poeple instead ofYoutube videos about intrusive thoughts.
Comments
My therapist told me when I have intrusive thoughts to remind myself that it is just a thought the more you try to ignore it, the harder it will be to stop it. Try to counteract the thought with something positive.

That probably a good thing. Tbe you do not want to form that addiction. Had an aunt that kept smoking after surviving cancer multiple times saw her throughout my childhood, balding from chemo and still smelling like cigs, looking more raddled on each visit. It can be addictive enough for people to justify smoking when they are totally aware it is killing them there. More than enough alternatives to relax. Having an ice, a delicious hot chocolate or even a nice, cool beer in moderationconfusion is more enjoyable and probably healthier. In most cases. Plus smoking will destroy your taste buds and ruin enjoyment of these things.

I hear how that is wrong. I hear that I need to prioritize myself, but surely there must be some other way. Lastly, I need to go outside once a day. I am scared to walk around my own neighborhood, but I have bigger things to handle than this stalker guy. Now, if he attacks me again, I need to be ready to call the cops. I need to be ready to talk to the people who support me instead of minimize the issue. Mins a day outside minimum for the next days. Lastly, I need to plan my am I doing anything special?

Honestly, I think you took a big step into a right direction with quitting your job. So congrats on this one, I would say, take a few days off, take a little break, maybe even a weekconfusion, and then start to search for a new job, a job where you feel comfortable not only doing it, but in the social surrounding as well, but in general, I am proud of you that you took this step.

Title: Still going through traumatic event.

So for context, I had just turned and told my other friend that is a little older. Hey, go to plus omegle. So we do. And as you would expect, its penis, more naked men penis and another penis, then there was a girl with cleavage, no face showing. And my friend asked her to pop a titty as a joke, which meant to flash im like, yeah, ask! Since finally, there was no penis. She showed a boob. Nothing else. My friend had screenshotted it. I told him to delete it, cause thats fucked. He asked how old she was? She said, like, or something? It was almost a year ago. This sent my mind into a total spiral. I was paranoid that I had done something horribly wrong when I was just curious on what I had thought was an plus site. They dont know what I look like, as I never showed my face or what I sound like nothing was exchanged, so no phone numbers, addresses, etc. It lasted about a minute and a half, and that was the end of it. For starters, would a singular boob be seen as sexually explicit? And secondly, realistically, how could I calm myself down every time I want to try anything new? This voice in my head tells me it could all be torn down because of this stupid minute of my life. I started isolating, deleted social. Media. Dont really go out? All because of this there are actual bad people on websites.Like those. And for some reason a voice in my head constantly compares myself to them when that was never the goal I keep track of how many months go by think about since my friend showed his face. If it gets on him, it could come back to me if im a bad person what I could be capable of, and more types of intrusive thoughts, I also tend to alter the memory and turn it into a lot of different things I dont know what is real from not real anymore. Any advice is helpful. Thank you.

This is definitely something you need a professional to deal with, cause no one on this planet is going to come after you because you took a screenshot of a boob from some unknown girl who may or not be underage.

Hi. To summarize, I have always been considered the gifted kid of my family, the one everybody believed in the pretty face, the kid who was supposed to make mum and dad proud I am, and I do not feel worth it at all. Yes, I have had my fair share of successes, travelled quite a lot, moved out of my hometown, got a degree, got a corporate job, just got my drivers license. But all of this just seems like nothing to me when I see other people my age on social media and not influencers, but regular people. I knowconfusion, sharing their exciting and creative lives, pursuing their dreams and meeting new people and having projects and getting exposure. What do I do all day? I wake up in the morning open my laptop, cause, wah, since yayconfusion and sit there for his. Then I close it in the evening, and nothing besides chores, spending time with my, of occasionally going out with friends or attending online classes for my masters, which was also poorly chosen, because although I do love the topic of cultural studies, I realized it will not help me in my career, but it will only help me gain some more general knowledgeconfusion. When I was younger, I thought I would become a powerful woman, someone who can change the world or just a little part of the world at my job. I am appreciated and got promoted, and everyone tells me I am a shining star, but I haveA bit of the imposter syndrome. And then again, what is so interesting about working in a corporation? I always dreamed that when someone asked me who I am, I would say my name and some fancy job title, its not the case. Now, I do have my hobbies and passions, but with all the hustle culture going on all around me, it feels like wasted time. If I cannot monetize my hobbies, then why bother? I feel like I have no purpose anymore? I daydream a lot and do nothing actually, and I feel like I am failing everyone around me. I feel unattractive because I do not feel like an interesting person anymore. Why would anyone be attracted to someone who does not work for their dreams? And I have been in a relationship for the past half year, and things are great, however, I feel like crap sometimes, because there are so many other girls who might be more interesting than me and he will eventually get bored of me. Writing it all down makes me realize how stupid that sounds. But I feel this is a safe space where I can share this fear. I do not know where I am heading, and I do not know what to do. I fear poverty, but I also fear risks. I fear abandonment, and I fear being just a regular girl. I fear judgement and damn everything sounds to me like the poor, rich girl whining about her boring life, while there are peopleWho really struggle to make ends meet. Will life be like this until I die?

Stop doom scrolling put a screen time lock on the apps you tend to doom, scroll on, put a show or movie on and commit to watching. Start a household chore or other task and leave your phone in a different room. Separate yourself from the scrolling.

Title: What therapy did help you
Thread
Hi, I have done talk therapy for many years now I am trying emir. I have always thought that finding the root cause of my anxiety would heal it. I find it helped, really, to understand me better. But I am finding it difficult to help with the anxiety itself. Have you found any therapy that helped? I also feel that along with anxiety comes depression, and it becomes a more complex situation. Thank you.

Title: Thought I was okay for most of my life now I am often times not
Thread
I have generally been the most outgoing and friendly person, and I think I still am kind of while I think there was always signs and symptoms of what I am about to mention, it only got so bad it affected my life in what I describe below the past few years. Let us say to I was in a very stressful, high pressure work environment, management of three working premises. This includes the he of staff, all stock control and everything you can possibly think of inbetween. Yep, I was taken advantage of work wiseconfusion. I was diagnosed with bad anxiety and was first put on stressam to manage it, which it did help alot, but my do said it is not long term. I was offered a job at a big state establishment a few months after being on stressam, and this new job had little to no responsibility on my shoulders. Although the previous job gave me severe anxiety, I seemed to get a bit better again at this new job. Plus, I now had medic care and pension included which I did not have previously. Now, after the initial new stage of work, I began to struggle alot in the job, as there is alot of rudeness and favouritism. I could go on and on about the problems in this new work place, which blindsided me as I thought this was the place for me to grow my career. Rascima is big bullying. Bitchiness is rife ineptitude and inequality, etc. It mattersMore who you know than what you know and then you get away with anything. By my do recommendation, I moved onto a more permanent medication, cilift the transition onto that was horrid, I was hallucinating, and my head was foggy all the time. But after my ish weeks, I equalised, and I was good to go not a care in the world. And I stayed like that for a long while. Now I might add mental health is not taken as seriously here, and in some cases, can still be very taboo to anyone under so alot of the time, when I opened up to people friends, family, they said, I should work to get off it. After about years of it. I did do that. I did not struggle at all. Coming off it, I weaned my self off slowly, to be fair. I did not even have the funds to keep myself on the meds. So I did what I did as best as I could. Now, it is been about a year and few months, maybe since I was off completely. I have had, or days where I just straight up, broke down crying before work, because a bitchy attitude that makes me feel crappy, but mostly I have been pretty okay this entire year, my closest colleague left for a different department, and I am so happy for her, but she helped me tremendously unbeknownst to her. As I did not tell her much about my issuesconfusion, but she had aNo nonsense attitude and with her around I felt stronger now we have a new colleague he is lbgt not that matters in his sexual choices I am pro choice of all kindsconfusion but I say it cause he has a very bitchy I am right manner and will take on everyone and anyone if he even slightly disagrees and can be very mean I recently find my self dreading going to work with him. He needed me to send something to him on a personal scale and blocked me right after and that hurt me. I am not his friend I do not plan to be out after work hours with him, but that stung, and that is where I noticed my pattern I always want to be liked, not loved or adored or anything, but I hate drama or confrontation and general bad vibes. It gives me major anxiety, and it is easy to avoid those things when people like you and I am struggling to get over. That should I go for counselling therapy? I tried the work program and it did not work for me? Do you have recommendations on tips for myself? I do not really want to get back onto the pills not cause I am against them. But the transition sucks is, and I will not be given any leeway at work. If I cannot handle a day I be endlessly talked about and ridiculed by individuals which will make my anxiety worse. I am trying so hard toGet out of my department as we are notorious as the shittiest dept in the organisation. I guess I am just looking for similar stories to not feel alone or advice on how you got through it resources, etc I am not based in the us or any it world country.

Title: Sleep onset.
Thread
I am hoping to find anyone who can relate. Once I get to sleep, I can usually stay asleep, but it is getting there. That is the problem. I can be so tired. But the moment my brain shuts off, I instantly wake back up over and over, and my heart will beat fast. When that happens, it calms down, I try again, and the moment I doze, I snap back awake. Eventually I fall asleep. Sometimes I sleep all night, and sometimes I toss and turn, but can still fall asleep. Then I just cannot figure out why I do this. I do have high anxiety, and my doc says it is just stress, but the meds do not really help that much

I am father of a small family. My son years old, I am living in northern germany, have a good life with a decent income, and all in all am pretty satisfied with all I have got. But the thoughts of losing all of this because of the ongoing events around ukraine, scare me shitless. What can I do about these thoughts? I cannot do much about the development of the crisis, but my thoughts circle around my country my neighborhood, my family being overrun by russian troops or bombed to hell when they decide to go nuclear. My parents must have lived through the same thoughts during the cold war and the tuba crisis. But my impression is that the situation is way more dangerous than the ongoing cold war back then. I do not know how to deal with this. I am already thinking of packing my stuff and fleeing west. But in a nuclear war, this will not help. I know it is probably just saber rattling on both sides.

The cold war was much worse like unbelievably bad. There were so many close calls that it is a miracle. Nothing happened like we were so close to complete annihilation, that whether or not we all get destroyed was down to the decision of one man who was not even a politician, stanislav petrov. It sucks now, but it really is not anywhere near as bad as the cold war don listen to politicians and certainly do not listen to the media.

I think you need to understand that your fears are incredibly irrational. You need to come back to reality. Germany is perfectly safe. There is no realistic threat of russian troops invading germany or a nuclear war. Your fears would be realistic if you lived in ukraine, but you dont. In fact, I know many people who live in eastern ukraine, and even they are not terribly concerned about a russian invasion. They are still going to work and living life as normal. We still do not know if russia will invade, but even if they do, it is unrealistic that it would escalate into a nuclear war realistically as a person in germany, the worst you will experience is some economic hardship in the event of a russian invasion of ukraine and the subsequent sanctions upon russia. You can expect prices to rise for various goods, some supply shortages, maybe sporadic cyber attacks and a rise in energy costs. I would suggest you focus on those issues instead of getting caught up in wild fantasies about nuclear war or russian troops in your backyard,

Title: Can stop ruminating on big mistake at work.

I screwed up big time at work. Basically, I started a project with external stakeholders without the resources to see it through. This happened due to miscommunications, some of which were definitely my fault. The decisions happened right around the time couid lockdown was lifting. My head. Space was not in the best place during lockdown. When negotiations started, I have past issues with depression that were resurfacing due to isolation, and was also in a rough patch with my partner. Due to his mental health, I was not thinking things through. I am also currently only working one day per week. Most of the rest of my time is spent doing a pod, which is not an excuse for dropping the ball. But my fieldwork ramped up once things opened back up. So I think busy ness with pod work contributed to the chain of miscommunication. Its all coming to a head. Now I am normally a high achiever and well regarded employee. I have made some big mistakes in the past, though I do not want it to be seen as a pattern. Past mistakes were usually due to lack of training or being overworked. This time, I feel like I knew better and did not listen to my intuition or delegate tasks. I have probably damaged my relationships with these stakeholders who are also people I personally really like I am hoping it does not also do too much reputational damage to our organisation before lockdown in may last year. I was prettySeriously overworked while trying to transition from full time work to a pod. My work involved collaborating with lots of stakeholders, sometimes on complex projects. I think once lockdown hit, I realised how tired I was from spinning so many plates. For so long I found it really difficult to re, engage with work. I think this also contributed to the mistake. I am mortified. I have spoken to both my manager and the stakeholders and have apologised. I am meeting with my manager next week to figure out strategies for solutions. In two weeks, we are meeting with the stakeholders to discuss the situation. The good news is that most actions taken so far are low cost to reverse, but there will likely be reputational damage for lack of follow through on the project and time and resources wasted so far I am struggling to not obsess about this. My sleep has been poor. The past week, I keep thinking about what would happen if I got fired or if my reputation was damaged so that it was difficult to find a new job. When I finish my pod, I work in a small sector. I did an online therapy session. It helped, but I am having a bad day today.

Theres a host of issues which would of been beyond your control, I believe, due to the broad range of negatives caused by the couid and the pandemic. And if you already have funding problems and lack of workforce on top of everything else, then how are you supposed to roll out and complete a project successfully? It appears to be impossible in the current climate, especially with volatile markets, and the downward pressures on costs in hard times, funding and charitable donations are squeezed. Society is too dependent on ngos. Now, with wealth inequality cited by data sources indicating a year high food banks are the new norm. Doctors across borders is a new one that springs to mind. This blanketed, not for profit label, is poor terminology to try and draw in donations. But thats just one example amongst a culture of unethical marketing practices,

I know very little about management, but as a layman, I think the best thing you can do for yourself is to just own your mistake, but do not dwell on it. Learn from it and do the best you can, annoyingly vague advice, I know. But what can you be expected to do beyond that? I think people will appreciate that you are able to recognise what went wrong and how to fix it.

If my hardware cannot keep up, then there is nothing I can do. But constantly being asked if im done or how much more time do I need makes me want to run into a busy highway I feel so pathetic. I know they all truly hate me and are so annoyed that this keeps happening. My work is not even any good, but I keep having to do this kind of crap. Im trying so goddamn hard to be good. I am giving it everything I got and it never feels good enough. They ve never made me feel good enough. I just feel like, shit!

I am so sorry you are feeling this way. I can imagine the stress you must endure when working towards other people needs and timelines. I am a project manager, and i, too, must work under strict deadlines and time constraints. One of the best things I have learned to help alleviate some of the stress on time is to provide a clear outlook to my customers. For instance, if I am to develop a process and then deploy it in a production line, I am usually aware of how long it may take me to complete. When I tell my clients my expected date of completion, I always add a major buffer if it will most likely take me a day, I will tell them it will take two, it always best to underpromise and over deliver rather than get caught up in overages. I hope this helps, and I wish you calm and peace.

I had this for a long time too well and still do occasionally confusion it. For worse, be of the anticipation cycle. Gee, I hope this time when I go to bed, it does not happen now I am thinking about it, anticipating. It happens, dammit, confusion. I came up with a plan. If it happens, I am going to get up out of bed, fill my hot water bottle, make a cup of tea, and sit on the couch trying to get warm. Panic makes me super cold confusion. I am going to put on a show I have watched before that. I like, and just let the waves of nausea and panic pass while I sip tea and get warm. Having a plan helped a lot when I started to feel the what if I lay down and then panic, I could answer that. What if, with my plan? Well, if it happens, il just get out of bed and go to the couch. Somehow, knowing I had a plan and it was not going to be chaos. If it happened made them stop occurring with so much frequency.

According to what my doctors have told me, yes, it is normal for those with anxiety, however, since in your case, you say you feel it particularly when walking. Maybe it could be something else, not something bad, just strained muscles or pinched nerve due to muscle tension.

The other dude moved with his of, and that is when things get weird for me. I feel like I have always had a level of anxiety and paranoia, but I never really had it around friends just pal. I do not know. But over the last few months, staying on their couch, I feel like every time, so one looked at me and was judging me. But last friday, while I was watching to, I could have swore they were basically mocking me in the most passive, aggressive way. Talking about I was a schizophrenic and was on the verge of a mental breakdown. I texted my closest friend in the house and asked him honestly, if they were talking bout me be, I would have nipped it right there. He said, no, but for some reason, I did not believe him. So I just asked them out loud and of, they denied it, but I just could not believe them be. What they were saying was to oddly specific to not be me. So that basicallySet me off the next morning I am pissed and all I want to do is fight then dip so I basically confront them all about it in the morning not in a mature adult way tho so when I heard all they acting like they did not know what I was talking bout I just lost it. I hit my close friend in the face. We tussled for a lil. Then I left. My question is do you all think I was tripping or what I never had that feeling and with my anxiety, I never made up words on my head and I was so sure they was talking bout me

They probably were not talking about you. But so what if they were? Is that really the worst thing in the world and something to get upset about?

See a psychiatrist, and I mean that in the most endearing way possible, you could be paranoid, but it could also be your gut telling you the truth, and your friends are too immature to face you head on I have had a situation where I thought everyone was talking behind my back, and it turned out they were so I wouldnt be completely shocked if you were in the right at the same time. It is unlikely you are.

I took lexapro in the morning and trazodone at night for years and never had any issues. If you are concerned about it, though you can always ask your doctor or the pharmacist who prescribes your meds, sometimes it is easier to get in touch with the pharmacist if your doctor is really busy.

I am father of a small family. My son years old, I am living in northern germany, have a good life with a decent income, and all in all am pretty satisfied with all I have got. But the thoughts of losing all of this because of the ongoing events around ukraine, scare me shitless. What can I do about these thoughts? I cannot do much about the development of the crisis, but my thoughts circle around my country my neighborhood, my family being overrun by russian troops or bombed to hell when they decide to go nuclear. My parents must have lived through the same thoughts during the cold war and the tuba crisis. But my impression is that the situation is way more dangerous than the ongoing cold war back then. I do not know how to deal with this. I am already thinking of packing my stuff and fleeing west. But in a nuclear war, this will not help. I know it is probably just saber rattling on both sides.

I would like to validate your feelings of anxiety. These thoughts must be absolutely gut wrenching to circulate in your mind all day as the geopolitical theater plays out and you have no way to control it. I, for one, am certainly concerned about the situation. However, I am across a large ocean and not sharing any borders with russia or their allies, so I cannot fathom your concerns. I believe the best course of action is to keep positive thoughts and let the negative go understand that you are far removed from the decision making on the russian ukraine. Conflict and to dwell on possible outcomes may cause you severe anxiety and depression. Your toddler is very impressionable, especially with emotions. So it is important to project calm and love during times of hardships and stress. I understand this is all very difficult. Try and rely on those familial connections and discuss this with friends. So you can let go of some of the worries. I am sending positive vibes out to the universe for you, take care

Hey, there I respond as someone who lives in israel and went through a thing or two. So I was a child when israel went through hundreds of terrorist attacks inside the country, early suicide attacks in buses, restaurants, etc. Confusion. And it was freaking scary. However, I remember my parents always trying not to panic in front of me and act normal as they could. It really helped me to grow up without any ptsd or something which some of my friends do have itconfusion. So it is really important for you to try not to panic in front of your kids. It okay to be scared do not get me wrong, but as a child, when you see your parents scared you feel desperate, and it makes you even more scared. I also went through a war, as I grow older in, and lebanese warconfusion, which was more scary for me because I did realize what is going on, and even had a missile exploded near our house. My family and I had this feeling that this is how our life is going to be for the near future. And we aimed for the worst. Fortunately, the war ended after about a month while we tried to live as normal as we could. I also got through over stuff in the army, but I am trying to make a point here. It ok for you to be worried or scared about what is going to happen. However, you must not let those feelings ofSomething that is not even happend yet to control. You live in a peaceful country which war is far away from it, and even though you have this feeling of war about to break in any minute, you must not let those thoughts control you that the real win. And that is how we live in israel every day at any moment, something can happen and trigger a war, but we need to live, right? We cannot just be scared from the things that we think could happen. I hope my point was delivered the way I wanted. And last thing, if you see, you cannot control your thoughts and anxiety. It is totally fine to seek for some medical help, therapist, psychologist, etc. Confusion

Title: Health, anxiety, except when I am actually ill.
Thread
For the first time in my life I am going through a prolonged episode of panic disorder. The anxiety will come in waves and on a bad day pretty much everything will trigger a panic attack. My main fear is that I have a stroke, but I have also been scared about my heart in the past. So basically I am terrified of dying or losing my good health. Before this episode, I had some mild anxiety in the form of hypochondria every once in a while, because my mental health is bad. My physical health is also weakened, where I normally would get sick once every years in the last months. I had stomach flu twice and bronchitis once. Now, here is the funny thing. Every time I get the flu, my anxiety completely disappears, until I am better. Then, when I am getting better, it is like my anxiety wants to catch up on the lost days by turning it up a notch. Is there anyone else who experiences this? My current explanation for this phenomenon is that my health anxiety is really on an existential level. I turned last year, and I am nowhere near where I expected to be in life when I was. I also have no idea where I want to go now or how I would get to a life more fulfilling there, this massive amount of pressure, but I am not really doing a lot about it. So I think that I really do not want to dieRight now, because if I do, my life would not have meant a lot, I would not have made myself immortal. Then when I am actually ill, all the stressors of life of trying to be someone fade to the background, and I only have one simple focus getting better. Everything else in life can wait because I am physically not capable of doing anything productive anyway. As soon as my symptoms start to wane, I get sucker punched by anxiety on steroids like todayconfusion. Sometimes I wish I could be a dog, not aware of its own mortality, just chilling all day without guilt. The whole idea of life being meaningless and that you have to create your own meaning puts so much pressure on us anxious people, and it is just creating so much suffering. Any tips on coping with existential angst, amp existential guilt, or is there a way I could somehow get into religion as a rational thinking person? He
Comments
I feel ya buddy. Health anxiety is also one of my main problems, and I relate to you in almost everything you said. However, when I am sick, I get even more anxious, thinking that I never recover about the existential crisis. I also got them. They suck as, and we feel detached from ourselves. The best advice I can give it not very good. I cannot deal with them. Yetconfusion is try to keep your mind occupied, do something you enjoy focus your mind on the present and not on the possibilities of dying and losing your health. If symptoms appear, try not to think of the worst case scenario. I know these advices suck. I am not very good at giving them, and I also cannot deal with my own stuff. Lao, but I hope that at least knowing you are not alone, it helps

We are the lucky men who will be going through the hard times portion of the cycle be vigilant, trust your gut and make sure your family knows what to do. If you have to get the fuck out of dodge, having some good backpacks with food, clothes and medical supplies ready to go is a good habit to be in anyways. Whether it is a natural disaster, a social upheaval or god forbid, war, far too many people are not even slightly prepared for as much as a long power outage.

Your help lies in your believe. Ask yourself in what you believe. Dou you believe in god or do you believe in yourself? Do you believe in neverending space and that you can be born again or do you believe that everything is only coincidence or do you believe that everything is god? Your answers against fear lies in your believe if you believe in love there is nothing what you can be afraid. Lets say there will come red world war earth will be destroyed by bombs and half of the civilization will be death or complete. Earth will be destroyed where you want to escape. Everything has its purpose. Look only to our history of our civilizations, only what we know. There were many civilizations on this planet before us. They are dying and new civilizations are coming. For example, I am looking on our space as on the neverending universe, maybe milions. And millions years ago, we were living on the mars, maybe also you, happy face or smiley. And imagine what we do. Nok know, do you know what? I think? What can help you a lot? Same? What I did I turned off the to, and I am not watching the news. I am not reading the articles on the internet. What happened? Where and what is maybe going to happen somewhere? I am not reading how many peoples are dying every day? Ok, maybe now I am not informed whats happenning? But I decided that I do not need it.I am from slovak republic, and I have two boys confusion. And what I need to know is that they feel as much love as it is possible. Maybe I will die today, maybe tomorrow, maybe years laters. That is not important. Take your sons and play with them as much as it is possible. Enjoy your moments. I wish you love.

I am feeling the same as you. I really hope that this ends in a good way. But since I cannot control that, I have been really focusing on the things I can do to show the ones I care about, that. I love them and prepare myself for a poorer outcome. I figure if nukes are not used, I want to have food and supplies in my home if rationing and high prices occur. I also work in the medical field, so I have signed up to volunteer in an emergency. It makes me feel useful when everything seems hopeless.

I am hoping to find anyone who can relate. Once I get to sleep, I can usually stay asleep, but it is getting there. That is the problem. I can be so tired. But the moment my brain shuts off, I instantly wake back up over and over, and my heart will beat fast. When that happens, it calms down, I try again, and the moment I doze, I snap back awake. Eventually I fall asleep. Sometimes I sleep all night, and sometimes I toss and turn, but can still fall asleep. Then I just cannot figure out why I do this. I do have high anxiety, and my doc says it is just stress, but the meds do not really help that much

I am father of a small family. My son years old, I am living in northern germany, have a good life with a decent income, and all in all am pretty satisfied with all I have got. But the thoughts of losing all of this because of the ongoing events around ukraine, scare me shitless. What can I do about these thoughts? I cannot do much about the development of the crisis, but my thoughts circle around my country my neighborhood, my family being overrun by russian troops or bombed to hell when they decide to go nuclear. My parents must have lived through the same thoughts during the cold war and the tuba crisis. But my impression is that the situation is way more dangerous than the ongoing cold war back then. I do not know how to deal with this. I am already thinking of packing my stuff and fleeing west. But in a nuclear war, this will not help. I know it is probably just saber rattling on both sides. But never in my life has it been so scary? Holy shit! It is so scary. They seem so eager to blow us all up

Hey, op I struggle with those thoughts too. I have written a couple long posts. Abt why a nuclear war is highly unlikely. If you look through my post history, you can read them in full but long story short, this will probably be a rough news cycle for a few weeks to go yet. But neither putin biden nor nato are contemplating using nukes. And ukraine does not have themconfusion, like others have said, the fear right now is of a crisis in ukraine itself. But anyway, for some concrete advice that helps me when I stick to it, if you find yourself obsessively scrolling social media, checking the news cycle for updates but cannot quit cold turkey for the time being, try limiting your news consumption to at most minutes in the morning and evening, then leave the rest of the day to safe social media and routine. Try distracting yourself with things you enjoy, ideally, things that require some active participation on your part, rather than just watching, scrolling any kind of hobby or busywork that requires your concentration. If you cannot use your phone while doing it is a good pick. If you can do it outside near a window, even better, best of luck to you and me both, while we deal with this,

I live in the i, and it is really hard not to let my anxiety spiral about this, especially with the media hysteria. So I completely get where you are coming from. Rationalization helps a little, but sometimes the anxiety takes over, and this is certainly one of those situations. For me, I am not sure you are going to find any argument on here convincing enough to allay your fears, no matter how, based in fact and logic they are. I say this because I know how little those arguments help me when I am catastrophising. Instead, the things to focus on are limiting your exposure to the situation. Stop looking at the news and try to limit screen time. This is really hard, but it really makes a difference. You can also set up controls, so you do not see content that triggers your anxiety on social media distract yourself with other things. Whatever self care works for you, a lot of people find meditation or mindfulness helpful, grounding yourself in the here and now can really help defend against the worries about the future. I really hope you can find a way to take your mind of your worries. Op, the situation is scary, and it is so easy to get caught up in and to get stuck in a spiral of catastrophising. But the best thing you can do is to focus on your own. Well being and resilience. Hopefully, that will help things seem less apocalyptic, but I know it isReally hard.

Im living in northern germany too. However, I think you are overreacting and being alarmist. The media here in germany is not hyping up anything. So im not sure why you are suddenly scared and or lacking faith in diplomacy. Were you scared as hell when the refugees came in too? Were you scared as hell when russia annexed a part of ukraine a few years ago, I think you are jumping to conclusions, and that is not what your child and family need from you right now do what every other german european is doing right now and protect your family from couid and go about your daily business.

I would like to share my perspective with you. I live in northern arizona, about am north of mexico. A lot of people vacation there, and they seem to like it, but I have to go by what they say, because I have never been to mexico. I have met some awesome people from mexico and just want to say that I am not attacking mexico. Some scary things happen. In mexico. The drug cartels have become a virtually unstoppable force. Theyare heavily armed and kill anyone who they believe even remotely threatens their drug business. Every now and then, mass graves of disfigured bodies are found and worse, the police and even the military are powerless to stop them, because either the cartels bribed them to let their illicit business continue, or they just kill them too. All of this happens am from where I live. However, some scary things happen here in the us, too. School shootings, mass shootings elsewhere, the healthcare system, etc. Your fears are very understandable. However, I just wanted to point out that the distance between hamburg, I do not know where exactly you live in northern germany. So I just chose that cityconfusion and liv, the largest city in western ukraineconfusion is over. Am plus. There is poland, another nato country, over most of that distance, even if russia decided to attack ukraine, which I do not think will even happen because it would be economic suicide. With heavy military casualties, they would likely just annex a pro russianBlast where most people are already russian citizens. Its not like they would occupy all of ukraine and turn their eyes westward. Putin is stuck in his kob mindset and wants to send nato a message. What the media is not saying is that there are a lot of people in russia who think this is a bad idea. I do not let what happening across the us mexico border bother me. You should not be worried about what is happening past poland eastern border either. Germany is one of vatos strongest and most valued members. Youl be safe no matter what

It is anxiety. Your picked up current issue in eu and expanded it beyond what can really happen. So typically, for anxiety, look into how to calm catastrophic thoughts. Cognitive behavior therapy also, reading what is happening can really help. So read about intrusive thoughts, and I do not suggest you move, because this will only reinforce your anxiety, and if it does not help get a therapist, it is worth

Hello from croatia. I am actually from florida originally, but I moved here in to be with my croatian husband. We just started a family of our own here. Our son just turned months old. I can completely understand your anxiety and where it is coming from. I have had similar worries myself. The best thing to do is try and remain calm and talk through these worries with yourself or someone you trust. If you just internalise everything, it tends to keep building and getting worse. Putin is not going to attack a nato country. I am not sure of the exact numbers, but nato forces are numbered in the millions. Theres no comparison there when it comes to russia is vatos collective resources. Germany is a nato member. Croatia is a nato member. There are other nato member countries placed between us and ukraine. Nuclear war will not happen. Theres so much mutually assured destruction floating around that nobody would dare risk bringing that hammer down on themselves. The risks for actual warfare expanding beyond ukraine are so microscopic, there is no point in even worrying about it. But I know this is easier said than doneconfusion. When you find yourself feeling anxious, try to talk yourself out of it by thinking of the points above. Talk it out with someone you are comfortable with and they can reassure you as well. Step back from the doom scrolling on reddit or the news. Enjoy your family and live your best life

You should understand that this is no where near the level of danger that existed during the cold war during that time, nukes were aimed at everything with hair triggers and with people who genuine thought it would be a good idea to use theirs first. Whilst the situation in ukrainian could escalate to where russia invades, there will not be much impact on you, except perhaps economically. In fact, you are in a position to influence things more than you realise. Its up to countries like germany to decide how far sanctions against russia should go if they invade, and so you can lobby your elected officials to act accordingly. Overall, though you should not worry at all, there will not be any military action beyond ukraine, let alone all the way to germany.

One of the best things to do is get away from the computer for a while, maybe go outside for a walk to clear your head. Also be careful of the information you are reading. There is a lot of fear mongering, especially in the conspiracy cult realms.

That sucks so much. I am sorry. You are going through this. Its hellish. My anxiety, characterized mostly by physical symptomsconfusion. Started because of a health scare. I was having some side pain for a month, and until I had my appointment and tests, monthsconfusion. I searched online for every symptom and disease I thought I was having like kidney disease or liver failure or something really bad. Turns out it is just muscular a. But I already made the damage during those three months of worry. Skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant. Dont google your symptoms. It makes things so much worse. You cannot change the results by worrying, but bow, it is okay that you feel that way. Accepting those anxiety episodes is the way to overcome them. This helped me quite a lot. When I try to fight my anxiety, it gets worse when I get a slight wave of an episode, and I am scared it will get worse. It gets worse when I just accept the fact that I am going through this and my body hurts, it will calm down, accept your thoughts, your emotions. It can be hard sometimes, but it is doable, and it can truly help. Meditation helps too. As a lot of people say, everytime I am stressing too much, I try to listen to even if you are not taoist, im notconfusion. It is such wise words, and so calming it helped me overcome a bit. My fear of death of the future, but anyGreat meditation that you like will do the job red heart.

This is normal in a relationship where one person is suffering from anxiety it takes a toll on the other person sometimes a huge toll so if your not married and it looks like there is no end in sight for her then it is going to be easier to rationalize leaving especially if you guys are young it is what it is if it is to much for her then you need to let her go for her own mental well being and then just focus on yourself and therapy keep negative things out of your life news shows social media anything that is negative do not put it in your mind it will help

Long story short, my ex stood me up on valentine day. I was only in an official relationship with them for a month, dating for four months. So the relationship was not super serious, but they were my first relationship. They were supposed to come to my apartment for a dinner date. I texted several times and called times. They picked up on the second call and said, I cannot. Right now I text you. I said, I look out for the text and hung up. One of my last messages to them was me asking them to text or call me tomorrow, because I want to understand what happened in case them not responding was an emergencyconfusion. They never responded. Hours after I sent the last text, I broke up with them via text. I talked about how I am done and the fact they stood me up on valentine day really hurt. I said they do not owe me an explanation, but the lack of an explanation speaks for itself. I then talked about how I enjoyed being with them, but I cannot do this anymore. I wished all the best for them for their future and career. I am starting to have anxiety over the way I broke up with them from reading online. It seems like breaking up with people over text is one of the worst ways to do it. Should I have just not said anything? Should I have given them more than a day to wait for them toRespond I feel like I went about this in the wrong way at the same time what they did was super shitty and I feel like I am gaslighting myself into believing I was the one who was in the wrong I think a part of me is also wishing that this relationship never ended because I enjoyed their presence and attention and that if I never broke up with them and just waited for them to respond, this relationship would still be ongoing it.

First relationship is always really hard to get over. I think you feel like you really fucked something up, but in reality, you probably made the right choice. How often does anyone get the first chance at anything they do, right? Relationships are so complicated, I would almost be a bit alarmed if I got it right the first time I definitely still wanted to. Then for some reason. In hindsight, one thing I wish I would have done differently with the end of my first relationship was to not beat myself up over what I did wrong or what I perceived to be things I did wrong. Chances are, this is just an immaturity thing. Your partner did not know how to break up with you to pursue something new. And in trying to avoid hurting you, they did even worse and stacked a lie on top of their bad decision, making the time you are no longer wasting on a person who did not value your company in the same way you valued theirs is actually a good thing. You can spend that time and energy on anything you want. Now, don beat yourself up over it at all. Just try to come to terms with things not going right this time and learn from it. You all change so much in the next years because of who you meet and how they treat you. And vice versa, you will probably look back and be happy. It did not go a lot further beforeIt ended.

For me, you did the right thing. It sounds like your ex did not respect you enough to simply explain what was going on, especially on valentines day. I was in a relationship with a narcissist. I did not realise it at the timeconfusion who had very similar traits. And it has done me far more harm than good. If this person does not have the common decency to reply to a text, you are right to cut them loose. It does not matter how you do it, but it was the right thing to do. The fact that you are anxious about it shows that you care, which is far more than your ex did.

Title: I am starting to feel anxiety over the way I broke up with my.
Thread
Long story short, my ex stood me up on valentine day. I was only in an official relationship with them for a month, dating for four months. So the relationship was not super serious, but they were my first relationship. They were supposed to come to my apartment for a dinner date. I texted several times and called times. They picked up on the second call and said, I cannot. Right now I text you. I said, I look out for the text and hung up. One of my last messages to them was me asking them to text or call me tomorrow, because I want to understand what happened in case them not responding was an emergencyconfusion. They never responded. Hours after I sent the last text, I broke up with them via text. I talked about how I am done and the fact they stood me up on valentine day really hurt. I said they do not owe me an explanation, but the lack of an explanation speaks for itself. I then talked about how I enjoyed being with them, but I cannot do this anymore. I wished all the best for them for their future and career. I am starting to have anxiety over the way I broke up with them from reading online. It seems like breaking up with people over text is one of the worst ways to do it. Should I have just not said anything? Should I have given them more than a day to wait for them toRespond I feel like I went about this in the wrong way at the same time what they did was super shitty and I feel like I am gaslighting myself into believing I was the one who was in the wrong I think a part of me is also wishing that this relationship never ended because I enjoyed their presence and attention and that if I never broke up with them and just waited for them to respond, this relationship would still be ongoing it. After I broke up with them, I found evidence I was being cheated on but none of the evidence is timestamped. So I am not certain if I was actually cheated on that a whole other can of worms it I just wanted to rant about my feelings

I get feeling anxious over it, but it sounds like you stood up for yourself and the simple respect you should receive in a relationship, regardless how new. Sure, it is not ideal to breakup via text. But I had a year old man break up with me via email. So I mean, hey, do what you got to do. Breakups suck any way they happen. You deserve better than what it sounds like. This person treats you like there. No excuse for any of that. Be gentle with yourself. It will be okay.

Title: Panic attack relief.
Thread
Earlier today, I felt a panic attack coming on. My heart rate was all over the place, and I felt pretty faint, but I remembered reading that placing an ice pack on the middle of your chest and the sides of your neck could stop a panic attack. So I tried it, and it immediately worked. My heart rate went from the range back down to my normal range. Apparently it has something to do with a nerve that runs along those areas. I felt so much better afterwards and was able to carry on with my day. Ive had gad and panic disorder for years of my life, and this is literally the only trick that has ever stopped. A panic attack just wanted to share for anyone who might need it

Your vagus nerve and learning how to stimulate it can be one of the most productive things for your anxiety. Other ways to stimulate it are humming, singing, splashing cold water on your face or even gargling.

Title: Anxiety phase, lack of experience, confusion.
Thread
For a couple years, I ve been trying to uncover this feeling inside me. I am considering talking about going to a counselor, but I want advice. Before I make a commitment, I would consider myself to have an extroverted personality with an introverted character. If that makes sense, I love to socialize and go out, but to an extent because I get overwhelmed really easily, especially with a big group of people. If I get overwhelmed, I freeze on the spot and feel like I want to bawl my eyes out. Sometimes I start to shake, and it is never for a specific reason it just kind of happens whenever I am in a situation such as this. I usually excuse myself to go to the bathroom, take some time for myself and then come out like nothing happened. That is when I socialize. Cuz I do not do a lot of it, even when I want to. I have been in near isolation since the grade up until that point going to school was very overwhelming for me. I made barely any friends, and even at times, people would bully me or touch me. I was also afraid of men for an extended period of time, because I was groomed and threatened online in the grade by a catfish acc, posing as a college girl who wound up being an old man. What a surprise it not really a time of my life that I think about anymore, but maybe it has some relevance.To this I took it upon myself to ask my dad if I could do online school not only because of the sensitivity I had to going to a brick and mortar but also because I wanted to pursue my athletic dream of being an artistic gymnast I really enjoyed my time doing online school years in totalconfusion but I was extremely deprived of socialization I only hung out with the only friend I had made from school and although I went to gymnastics frequently I never spoke or made any friends come the grade I wanted to return to brick and mortar since I did not want to miss out on the is experience whether good or bad I just wanted to get myself out there cuz I was just so lonely unfortunately this did not end up being the case, as my dad did not allow me saying that I would not have the capabilities to defend myself in front of others and saying that I am so different that I did not need social interactions like the rest to add on. Instead on continuing with online school, I was made to drop out months before ending my the grade year due to my father political views and not wanting the liberal schools to influence me any longer or some is as of today date I am pursuing a ged diploma equivalency to finish my school, which I do not think is the worst thing in the world. But I think all the timeHow much of a different person would I have been if I had the ability to socialize more? I am hoping that college will be my ticket, but we see I just feel so different around people, because at my age, they have already got a grasp on the basics of life. They have connections, a job, a story to tell, and I am stuck in a bubble. I know I am absolutely not the only one going through it, but it really feels like it. When half of your family is mexican and come from a place where literally everyone is sociable and has friends, then you really feel like an outlier. I cannot even light a match or order food on the phone without being on the brink of a breakdown, stuff that should be easy for me to know, but was either never taught how or cannot handle the feeling of being put on the spot. And I feel so pathetic. How am I going to survive on my own? If I cannot get a grasp on myself? Am I just afraid and need to get used to the world, or am I suffering from anxiety? What should i

I think it would be a good idea to see a counselor, even if you do not have anxiety or anything. I have learnt recently that seeing a professional can be a really helpful process, that everyone could benefit from one way or another. Plus, depending on where you live, you might be able to see someone for free.

Title: Just accepted a job offer, amp regretting
Thread
I am a mechanical engineering graduate that took a year break after graduating to develop my programming skills. I decided to go back to the workforce recently and got an engineering job offer shortly after my programming skills actually helped. This is my first job. After graduating, nice bosses, great work environment, flexible, great pay, they raised the pay and changed the title. For me, I love the job, and it is not the actual job I am regretting. Everything is perfect about it. The only issue is that it is not in the industry I always wanted, and I am passionate about. I wanted to work in industry a and technically specialize in that industry. As an engineer, I feel bad and guilty, because I know if I end up getting another job offer in the actual industry I want and is my dream company. I will leave this one even if it is week after work. I am kind of feeling guilty and regretting it, because it is a very small company, and the owners of the company were very nice, amp accommodating to me. I tried to stall the job offer as much as possible in case anything happened, but nothing did. So I just accepted it. I am not in the best financial situation right now and do not have any other job offers. I do not know if I will ever get one

The other comment here already was a really good one I have been were you are in a somewhat similar situation, and I made the wrong choice of switching things up. It sounds like the job you got is a really good entry level job. Having a good working environment is a huge plus, and in some fields very hard to find. So hold on for now you will learn skills there that you can use in the other field of your choice. I can promise you that every job I have ever had has given me something. It is way easier to say that now, once I have had more jobs back then, I was also stressing about it not being perfect or whatever. But if it has tons of good stuff, like you said, you have hold on for a while. You never know if something awesome comes across you there

Title: Is this attempted murder to mental illness
Thread
I. So I have severe ocd and anxiety. Now I have a grandmother who I really do not like she caused me and my family a great deal of trauma, and I have decided to talk to my therapist about her, however she is living with us now, as she is very old now, months back, she had low blood sugar level, because of which she fell down. My dad came to me and asked me what to do as I am a med student. My first thought was, oh, finally I told him to give her sugar, and he said that they gave her tang, sugary, drinkconfusion. He asked me whether she must take insulin or not, and I think I said not. Then he asked me whether to give her lunch or not, to be honest, I am not sure. So I told that let her eat some food but not too much cus we do not want her sugar to spike. She is diabeticconfusion. Then my dad went, and I immediately googled what to do. Google, said, give carbs and avoid fats. So now instead of checking on what they were giving her, I just thought, meh, whatever id and continued my life. I later went down and told my dad to check her sugar again to make sure it is not gone too up high. She was ok by the end of the day. A month later, I remembered this and thought, why did not. I tell my dad not to giveHer fatty food? Was it because I wanted her to die as horrible as it sounds? It is true. I want our lives to become normalconfusion, and if it was because I wanted her to die, does that make it attempted murder? I feel terrible. I do not want to kill her. I do not want to hurt her or anyone, but I cannot get over the guilt.

A draft will likely never happen again. Most war engagements are with drones and other technology. Hardly anyone is on the first lines anymore. Also, if it did, there are a lot of ways to avoid being drafted. I would not worry about it. There are a lot more realistic things to worry about.

Title: I bored of myself.
Thread
Everyday, I find a new problem to obsess, and I have no friends to share or take help. I just have a boyfriend, but sometimes he also cannot stand. He is getting tired of me while trying to help.

I wish there is one person in the world, just one. Not more wish one person can stand and love me. I am thinking about break up. My of he does not deserve me. Do you have any advice

Maybe try therapy. Its a good way of letting it all out and maybe that way you wont feel like you are bothering people or being too negative around them.

Title: Feeling scared, frown, sad, angry or pouting.

I woke up mins ago to feeling my heart racing. Its crazy because I felt my heart before I actually woke up. Frown, sad, angry or pouting. And when I did wake up, I felt like I took a big gasp for air. I am absolutely terrified of sleep, apnea, frown, sad, angry or pouting. I want to blame it on anxiety, but ink. What to do also, right after I did wake up, my stomach cramped and I had to go to the bathroom. Could it all have been from that or something? Frown, sad, angry or pouting? Has anyone else felt this

That is why I always make sure I finish my business before I leave the house for work it, the office that gives me those feelings, emotions, but sometimes that is not enough. As soon as I sit down and see those stupid documents paper on my desk, my tummy starts to act funny. Luckily, I arrive earlier than most of them. I still have the chance to poop at the office without them knowing as for coffee. I stopped drinking coffee few years ago, but I do remember that gave me troubles, too, and I already skipped the milk and sugar

Title: Mouth burning, tingling from anxiety.
Thread
Can anxiety make your mouth feel like it is sore and burnt as if you just drank some hot coffee I started having panic attacks last year and one of the first symptoms I got was severe tingling in my mouth now I have more of a soreness like I drank something hot then brushed too hard which gets worse the more stressed I am it on my palate along my gums and the tip of my tongue I can kind of taste the soreness like a metallic taste if that makes sense and I oversalivate I really do not know what it is and it scares me especially because I have a fear of food allergies I think it is just anxiety but it is such a weird and real feeling that it is hard to believe just wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar
Comments
Last night, I was having a pretty severe panic attack and thought I might have been having a stroke or something, and my tongue was all tingly and felt swollen. I also was getting weird sensations and smells that would trigger rapid heart beats in the morning. It felt like my neck was swollen and sore. I would honestly say that you most likely did have these sensations because of anxiety. In my experience. It can cause you to feel every nasty thing you can imagine. Your brain can play some really bad tricks on you when your in that state, if you know that you were having bad anxiety, then there, most likely was a correlation there

Title: Sickness and intense stomach cramps trigger warning just in case
Thread
Possible trigger warning hello, everyone basically I have had gad all my life when I was around years old I began getting extremely sick when I was stressed about a big event coming up I would have horrible stomach pain and nausea for a week I would not be able to eat or drink anything even water without immediately throwing it up the only thing I was able to keep down was these electrolyte popsicles for some reason and even then not all the time at one point when I was about I was so sick I ended up in the hospital for days because of dehydration I lost about pounds in a week and was very pale and weak they did several tests over those three days and found nothing wrong I mentioned to the doctors that it might be my anxiety but they completely dismissed it maybe mi but confusion they thought it had something to do with my bowels and I was on a laxative for over a year, which I admittedly lied about taking most of the time because I knew that was not the problem eventually for some reason I guess I grew out of it and it has not happened for years. Now I confusion however, now I have a new problem in times of stress. I now get incredibly painful stomach cramps I recently started a new full time job for the first time confusion and about a month ago I was late for work not too late, literallyLike minutes, because it is currently winter, where I live and can get pretty bad. I texted my boss and then apologized. When I got there. He was completely fine with it. Did not ask me what caused me to be late did not bring it up again. He a really great guyconfusion. Even then, I had intense stomach cramps for hours. It was constant pain for nearly hours, no matter how much I tried to convince myself that everything was fine. I was not going to get fired. He was not mad, etc. To describe the cramps, it is like a mixture of poop, cramps, sorry, mi againconfusion and period cramps to all the ladies out thereconfusion, but higher up, like a stabbing, burning, aching pain at times during the episode, it can be so bad that I feel nausea. I am on the verge of tears. I cannot focus on what I am doing or what is being said to me. It even happens when I am not actively stressed about something in particular. The other day, for example, it was a normal day. I got to work on time. The drive there was normal and around am I work? Confusion? I started getting the cramps, and it did not let up until around. Am that night, I was not even worried about anything specific. I tried everything from stretching, calm, breathing, eating something, taking a short break to relax, talking to someone telling myself everything was okay, but nothing worked. This is gettingLong. So I end it here. I do not know what the point of this post is, but I just had to say it because it is driving me crazy. Does anyone else experience anything like this? And what do you do for it? If anything? Thank you for reading.

Once I jumped in yhe car, it hit me and my mind went into a frenzy. Heart started pumping. Maybe it was the adreadaline, which I wasnt use to. I dont know. But yhen my heart races after thinking about how I feel, which then makes it worse. Does anyone else get like this? I would like know your stories and what you have done to help overcome

Yep. Me too. Body sensations or anything by feeling off freak me out. I wish I had some good advice. The only thing that sort of helps is when I have had a particular sensation before I talk to myself and rationalise that these sensations are normal for everyone. I am just noticing them more because of anxiety and that the sensations are not dangerous. I am sorry, friend, I know this is difficult.

You re not alone. Friend health anxiety is scary it consumes us, makes us feel detached from life and even makes us feel depressed. I suffer from this so damn hard. Most of the symptoms you will feel will be mostly anxiety. Some of them are scary as hell. What I recommend doing is cutting alcohol caffeine and something that may trigger anxiety. It really helps controlling these symptoms and fears. Another thing I can recommend is if any symptom is scaring you and you need reassurance, even though the reassurance should come from yourselfconfusion, go to the sub healthanxiety and post your symptoms, and your worries in the daily thread, someone most likely will help you and will tell you if they feel like that. It really helps to know we are not alone. I hope you get better. Friend

Some people help to get the thought out of their head by writing it out on intrusivethoughts. If my intrusive thought is a recurring one that stays the same and is primarily word based, I do my best to change its meaning by making an associated visual. So one that has been hounding me a lot lately because of work is I want to walk into a bus. This distressed me a lot until I started forcing the image of me walking though the open doors on to a stationary bus. It nullified the negative connotation and made it much easier to dismiss as a not useful thought. Why would I want to get a bus somewhere that does not let me do whatever I want to finish right now?

I am going to the doctor in a few days and I do not want a medicine that I would have to take everyday like an sriconfusion. I have gathered a list so far of medicines to research lorazepam xanax probably cant go with xanax because it might react with my birth controlconfusion propranolol. I dont think I will go with this one because I dont want to risk the side effect of hair lossconfusion. If you have any experience with the ones above, please share, as well as if you have any other suggestions. I want it to be something that I can take in the moment before. Also, can you drive under these meds? It would be nice so I could take them before work

If you need fast relief, xanax or ativan would be your best bet. I was prescribed klonopin once, and it took too long to kick in for me. And then I was a zombie for the rest of the day. But everyone is different.

My no sent me hydroxizine, mgconfusion and propranolol, mgconfusion, but none of them worked for my anxiety attacks. They are too mild for me. Propranolol is a beta blocker. It does not treat the psychological effects, but rather the physiological effects. It is supposed to lower your heart rate, but you will still feel the anxiety. For me, it kicks in about to hours. Hydroxizine is an antihistamine that is supposed to help with anxiety. I take it just because is the only medication available to me, but I do not feel it working also, I do not like how antihistamines make me feel either

There probably were a lot of posts about ukraine lately, but just wanted to share my side. I live near the warzone, but not on the occupied territory. And tonight, for the first time since around years ago, I heard the artillery again, but back then as a teenager, my fear was not as big, and I just shrugged it off out of youthful naivety, I was not able to sleep tonight. I am just constantly shaking for a few hours already. I know there are closer ukrainian zones that are more unstable. But all this talk about nuclear war is driving me crazy, because my city is really important one in the whole campaign. And as of now, a major outpost, I know that I am not the only one who is worried and anxious, but people seem to just go on about their lifes or they are just good at getting their shit together. Unfortunately, I am not there yet, frown, sad, angry or pouting. I am trying to distract myself with anything possible, but it is hard. Each time I hear it, I get back to this half paralyzed state

The people around you may be less okay than they seem. Everyone responds to extreme situations differently. Some people can just block things out. Some people force themselves to do normal things and tell themselves things like, everything is okay if it was not okay, I would not be going to work like usual or something similar. Try to talk to someone about it. Everyone is going through it in their own way and needs support. You re not alone.

I am so sorry that you are here. I am so sorry that all of ukraine is here. The only thing that I can offer to you is a lifeline to talk about whatever you want you want to rant go for it. You want to be distracted. I have a wonderful new book that I would love to talk about. This situation is out of all of our hands. I do not wish to be patronizing, because I absolutely have no clue how you are feeling when I am struggling. I try to rationalize my way out. Even though it is incredibly hard to doconfusion you are not alone. I try to keep telling myself that fact as much as I possibly can, no one is ever truly alone. I am just one person in the us who is essentially watching from the sidelines. I am in no position to offer advice here, but I would at least recommend that you reach out to everyone around you, even if they are strangers. Community is an incredibly empowering force that might provide some comfort to you. I wish you your family and all of ukraine. Peace

Oh man, what you are going through is not normal, but I want to do my best to help. What you are feeling right now is what anyone anywhere would feel. The only conceivable thing I can suggest is to find a way out that honestly not going to be easy. Refugees are, in a word unpopular in countries who ought to easily be able to accommodate them. God be with you and yours. And if you need someone to just vent at you are welcome to message me, and I can give you a discord if you want a sympathetic ear.

I cannot imagine what it is like on the ground right now. But seconding what everyone else said about nuclear war being an unlikely outcome, ive written a couple responses to others here about why if you think reading those would helpconfusionits an anxiety I have, too, though I do not live anywhere close to the actual fighting. Also seconding what everyone said about distraction, find any kind of focused busywork helps me when watching to movies does not hobbies like reading, writing, crafts, computer stuff, etc. Confusion, just whatever you are into that requires some kind of active participation on your part. Also reddit for me in lol, that is why I just joined after lurking. Foreverconfusion hugs from a fellow anxiety sufferer. Abt the whole situation if you want them

Title: Phone avoidance and anxiety.
Thread
Hello, everyone phones make me really nervous. I have some anxiety related to texts, but that feels less severe. The real issue is with inbound phone calls, I will almost never pick them up, and it takes me a while to call people back. Nothing sets me into a hyper anxious state, like a phone call. It started several years ago, and I did not give it much thought. I figured it was a general dislike of talking on the phone. Now, reflecting on this and it getting worse. Over time, I have started to feel that it is most likely linked to an event that must have been a much more traumatic event that I had truly realized for years. Some years back, I received a phone call in the middle of the night from my friends mom, saying that one of my best friends had died in a hiking accident, and they, where driving their son home now alone, I could hear him crying in the backseat and learned that he had been the only other one hiking with him. It was a very short phone call as she was in shambles. And soon after, of course, I was too thinking over this memory after so many years in such a vid detail has defiantly opened up some wounds, and I feel as if it is personal growth, but it is making my anxiety worse. In the short term, I am definitely having trouble with the thoughts of loosing others or my girlfriend. IHave had several dreams lately that have consisted of getting similar calls or the same one. My avoidance of phone calls really feels like an extension of this traumatic event. Amp is working in a call center did not helpconfusion.

Yes, working in a call center where I was berated several times a day made my phone anxiety really bad. I have also received several very stressful phone calls in my life. So I am there with you. People get annoyed that I do not answer, and I always make excuses that I was cooking or driving. I am trying to train myself to not think of the negative when it rings. Its been a long time since I got a bad phone call, and usually it is just someone wanting to chat. It helps to remember that and be thankful that someone thought of me.

I have no friends and those who know me know never phone me unless it is important so work time is the only time I get phone calls I always think that I did something wrong so other people had to call me to ask what happened or I missed something for forgot to submit something and people from other departments had to call and ask me just once I made a mistake and it still haunts me just once I forgot to sent a time sensitive email it still haunts me

Title: Constant dizziness and vertigo.
Thread
I have always had anxiety my entire life, but it was always somewhat bearable while I was in school, so I never took any medication for it. About seven months ago, I had the worst panic attack I have ever had in my entire life. I was sitting in a restaurant and just started freaking out, and the friend I was with ended up taking me to the hospital. Ever since that night, I have had vertigo that never goes away. I have been dizzy for seven months, and I cannot even remember what it is like to not be dizzy. I have been to the doctor several times for this since one doctor diagnosed me with bppv, but my primary care doctor is convinced it is anxiety. I have had blood tests, a cat scan, ekg test, etc. And was always told we do not know what is wrong or its anxiety. Its probably just my anxiety convincing me otherwise. But there is a part of me that is convinced that it is not my anxiety, because I feel dizzy, even when I am completely relaxed. This has been horrible for me, as I feel like I cannot do anything I quit my job and I quit school, too. I am scared to even go to the store because I have a horrible fear of fainting, because I am so dizzy all the time. I just want to know if there is anyone that deals with this as well, because no one understands what iAm going through, and I feel so alone as of now, I am waiting for my genetic testing results to come back to see what anxiety medication I should be on. And I am hoping I can clear this up soon. Frown, sad, angry or pouting.

Same. And I have no idea what it is. It makes me feel out of whack sometimes like my body is not in sync.

I just want to know if there is anyone that deals with this as well, because no one understands what iAm going through, and I feel so alone as of now, I am waiting for my genetic testing results to come back to see what anxiety medication I should be on. And I am hoping I can clear this up soon. Frown, sad, angry or pouting.

Have you had allergy tests? Have you been to an ent and had ear tests done? Do you have your tonsils? Does the vertigo respond to meclizine or dramamine? I ask because I have had anxiety for years, but I also had vertigo badly when I was in my twenties. And it turned out to be inter ear problems due to allergies. And I had to get an emergency tonsillectomy and seven years of allergy shots. And I still get vertigo sometimes, even now, decades later.

You can try working out at home or you can go with your friends if that helps confusion.

There probably were a lot of posts about ukraine lately, but just wanted to share my side. I live near the warzone, but not on the occupied territory. And tonight, for the first time since around years ago, I heard the artillery again, but back then as a teenager, my fear was not as big, and I just shrugged it off out of youthful naivety, I was not able to sleep tonight. I am just constantly shaking for a few hours already. I know there are closer ukrainian zones that are more unstable. But all this talk about nuclear war is driving me crazy, because my city is really important one in the whole campaign. And as of now, a major outpost, I know that I am not the only one who is worried and anxious, but people seem to just go on about their lifes or they are just good at getting their shit together. Unfortunately, I am not there yet, frown, sad, angry or pouting. I am trying to distract myself with anything possible, but it is hard. Each time I hear it, I get back to this half paralyzed state

I cannot imagine what it is like on the ground right now. But seconding what everyone else said about nuclear war being an unlikely outcome, ive written a couple responses to others here about why if you think reading those would helpconfusionits an anxiety I have, too, though I do not live anywhere close to the actual fighting. Also seconding what everyone said about distraction, find any kind of focused busywork helps me when watching to movies does not hobbies like reading, writing, crafts, computer stuff, etc. Confusion, just whatever you are into that requires some kind of active participation on your part. Also reddit for me in lol, that is why I just joined after lurking. Foreverconfusion hugs from a fellow anxiety sufferer. Abt the whole situation if you want them

Title: Miss drinking. Alc so much but the anxiety and depression the next day just is not worth.
Thread
Anyone else stop drinking because of their mental health issues. I am not sure if this is the place to post this, but damn, I am going out tonight, and I am really tempted to drink. I am not an alcoholic, but would drink on the weekends. And I have stopped for a month because the anxiety and depression was just getting worse. Anyone in a similar situation as me
Comments
I am in a very similar situation. I am confusion. Days sober today. Typically, I will binge drink about times a week, starting out very fun, but by the end of the night, lonely, regretful and ashamed, ive realized that alcohol does literally nothing good for me. Its a poison, and it hold me back. This realization has really helped stay sober. Another tip that has helped me is that drinking is a learned behavior. When you started drinking, you taught and trained yourself to think that drinking needs to be a part of most aspects in your life having fun, socializing, relaxing. But when you were a child a non drinkerconfusion you had so much fun without alcohol. You played outside, had a wild imagination, faced your emotions good or bad sober. So basically you can relearn how to live that way again, because you have already done it. When you were a child, you just need to recondition yourself. Anyways. Good luck to you.

So I met up with my doc earlier this week to discuss the results of my latest blood work from last month everything was fine except for my liver apparently I fucked it up with laxatives and herbal supplements aka my happy pills it johns wort mainlyconfusion I used those things to suppress my insecurities instead of facing them and now I am having my first health scare I have less than a month to heal my liver the doc said to stop taking those things and get blood work done a few days before the next appointment. The last time I used a laxative was the night before the appointment. I used them in the days leading up to it because of those stupid doctors office scales that weigh you like pounds more than what you actually are. I never had a health scare like this, and I am so anxious and afraid I do not want to turn yellow and die. I really needed to vent about this

Title: I am lonely, always lonely. I do not know what to do.
Thread
All my life. I have done impressive things, but it is never enough. I never feel fulfilled. And I run from the good times, because what follows is usually the bad lately, I feel defeated. My girlfriend left me, and it is all my fault. I should have been better, but I cannot fucking function like normal. I have tried to be positive. Quit smoking cigarettes, got multiple job opportunities and ended up with a great job boss likes me, wants to help me get better work and staff love me. I go home feeling hollow. Im only happy in my dreams. I want to reach out and talk to people, but no one is there from the outside. Looking in, most people probably think im fine. Why would not they? But inside, I feel dead to the world. I dont know what I need what I want, but this is not working. How do I do another plus years of this? I think about death daily and how much I want to sleep forever. I know its all wrong. But after the day ends and I head home, it all comes back. The loneliness. I, though I was fine with it before my relationship, and I know having one will not fix these problems. But I just want to be held, look up and see a smile and know that it is ok. I have stopped looking ahead. Even with greatness, I still feel anxious, nauseated and unable to participate in the social aspects ofLife I wish I never existed, because none of this would matter. I would not even know it. Thanks for reading, I guess, looking forward to sleep.
Comments
I get that loneliness and just wanting to sleep forever. But please don hold on a little longer. Life has a funny way of surprising you, and even though it sucks, there might be happiness and love waiting around the corner for you, and you could miss it. If you shut your eyes, I know how hopeless it all can feel, but please know that this stranger is happy. You exist. And if I could, I would run over there and hug you.

What previous replies said is indeed the obvious answer but to get philosophical you could also argue that there are broader socio cultural imperatives which people tap into condemnation and or marginalisation of a behaviour signals that it is not considered acceptable as counter to social and economic imperativesconfusion or that on a personal level I am normal because I am looking at a distance on the people who aren even if they do understand anxiety it may be socially beneficial to act as if it is something alien to them as a kind of communicative ritual amongst peers for an analogy consider how hetero guys might shit on and exclude gay ones in order to broadcast to each other that they are faithful to the group norms it not simply that they do not understand the gay guys it is that they are using them as the other to increase their integration into a group

Some people lack the imagination, accept that other people experiences might differ from their own. It not spite. They are just incapable of making the necessary, empathic leap. Try to be patient it is their problem, not yours.

I think it is hard to understand unless you truly experience it. Everyone has experienced anxiety to some degree so they think no big deal but if you have it chronically so bad that if affects your day to day life get panic attacks, etc. It is hard for them to imagine they think I had anxiety when I had that job interview, I just powered through and was fine. They do not get lucky for themconfusion how bad it can truly be and that you cannot just power through and it goes away.

As said in my post here on anxiety, you are not alone. I am living in germany, far away from the hot zone, yet I am still scared shitless by the recent events. I also feel like going on with my life. It might one day end up being too late to pack my stuff and run away. I do not want to run away. I just want to live my life in peace. It feels like this. Peace will soon be over if these idiots in their bunkers and high security offices keep provoking each other like that. It us, you and me who are going to suffer, going to lose everything their lives, their family, their peace. When these people do not get their shit together, as always, those who ignite the war will not be those to suffer and die. We are we are it so fucking scary

And as of now, a major outpost, I know that I am not the only one who is worried and anxious, but people seem to just go on about their lifes or they are just good at getting their shit together. Unfortunately, I am not there yet, frown, sad, angry or pouting. I am trying to distract myself with anything possible, but it is hard. Each time I hear it, I get back to this half paralyzed state

Title: How do you guys deal with people always saying you should not feel that way.
Thread
Like duh! I know my partner was my safe space. And when I am feeling anxiety creep up on me, I lean on him to reassure me and make me feel safe. The problem im having is its becoming increasingly obvious to me that he does not understand what my body and mind are going through in these moments, I try to explain it, but I always end up in tears and give up because the response is always well, you just should not feel that way. I feel like my safe space is not really my safe space anymore, and im struggling, keeping my anxiety at bay, like the thought of him telling me that again gives me anxiety. I just feel so lonely in this cause I cannot even talk to him about it. I just want someone to try to understand me instead of just telling me how I should be

Tbe I think you are being a little hard on him although I do not know you or him it sounds like it was not malicious intent and he clearly does not struggle with it so how could he know its like explaining colour to a blind man.

Title: Miss drinking. Alc so much but the anxiety and depression the next day just is not worth.
Thread
Anyone else stop drinking because of their mental health issues. I am not sure if this is the place to post this, but damn, I am going out tonight, and I am really tempted to drink. I am not an alcoholic, but would drink on the weekends. And I have stopped for a month because the anxiety and depression was just getting worse. Anyone in a similar situation as me
Comments
Yep I used to drink heavily in my early and stopped drinking for my mental health and because it didnt play nice with my antidepressant at the timeconfusion I still drink on occasion but now if I drink it is like drinks maybe once a week at the most, alcohol is terrible for depression and anxiety both. So if I notice I am having higher depression or anxiety symptoms, il usually avoid drinking anything for a couple months.

Title: Anxiety attack.
Thread
I was not going to post anything. But at this point I am desperate as soon as I was about to go to sleep, considering the fact I have not been sleeping well, like at all I only got like hoursconfusion. After that, I started shaking uncontrollably. I have tried all I can tried to distract myself, but I have been shaking and feeling like this for pretty much hours. I am so exhausted, and everytime I get into bed to try to sleep, I end up shaking again and my mouth and throat go very dry. It is so irritating when im also very tired at the same time, does anyone else have any ideas what I can do to quickly calm it. I have already had a rescue remedy, and I drink small sips of water. Those are the only things that have worked. I am not even worried about anything, so I am not sure why it is this bad

Its really weird for me on one hand, I can feel extra paranoid when I smoke, but theres another side to it, where I just dont really care about anything. So while I might be paranoid, I just end up not caring if that makes sense. I also enjoy it because it just makes me not care about anything. Really. I could be anxious about something all day then smoke and it fades it all away face with tears of joy.

I have. I noticed that sativa leaning strains can cause more anxiety, especially if I do too much. I try to stick to sativa leaning hybrids or a sativa that I know will not be too much because I also have depression. So I need the energy boost as well. Do your research on the strains and make a decision that way. I use leafy to check the description and read the reviews to see how it affects other people.

My psychiatrist says it works for a while, and then it actually increases your feelings of anxiety. When you do not use it, I would recommend only trying it for anxiety if your doctor thinks it could help you. There are so many medications out there that work better for anxiety. Its a process finding the right one, but overall better for recovery and treatment.

Try micro dosing with edibles. The gets metabolized into a slightly different form versus when smoking, and the high is less paranoia inducing, in my opinion.

I am a daily user, mainly for anxiety reasons, and it helps masks the anxiety well and allows me to deal with general life better, though it can have the opposite effect and make it worse at times. And it is then that I tend to take breaks from it. Finding the right strain is also important. Limo try a few different ones to see what works for you. Ingestion methods is also as important. I tend to vape or do edibles. They offer a cleaner, more longer lasting effect. I have also played around with cod, which can also help if you do not want to get high all the time vaping a cod flower with no, the might be the way to go for you. The cod oils for me tend to do nothing

I am years old and my life is absolutely fucked up. I have been alone and lonely for a long time. Eversince. I finished university, I am shy, introverted, full of anxiety so much I have stopped talking to people if they do not speak first and never strike up a conversation on my own. At this point, I have only spoken with my family and a few members of my extended family. Over the past two years, I got a few job offers, but I rejected them because I thought I will not be able to do them. So basically, I am currently a neet. Not in education, employment or trainingconfusion that my current status, I stay in my parents house. I just suffer from depression all day, and all night. Now, before I became such a waste of space, I used to have two best friends in school and high school. I cut ties with them when I was around years old, I closed all my social media and changed my number. Even then those two have often found me and texted me on my new accounts I created in social media. Last year in twitter and facebook, I immediately closed those accounts and deleted facebook and created a new twitter account with some other name. I thought that was that today, one of them texted my mum and got my number from her and texted me a few hours back. I was shocked. He had this number all this time. I used toText him with this number before I had my own mobile phone he sent me a hello now the situation is I do not want to interact with him and let him know what a pathetic, looser I have become. I thought I could cope with my depression through self depreciating humour, but I could not today I cried when I went into the bath today so no one could hear me cry in the house. What happened to me? I thought so basically I cannot interact or meet with him. I think I will kill myself if my best friend saw me like this. I bet those two are successful in life and are living lives to their full potential. I cannot believe I for once today, thought he was contacting me to make fun of me and kick me down and feel superior about his succesful life. But then I realised he does not even know about my life for the past few years, he has never hurt me. During our years of friendship, during school days can believe I thought that anyway, the advice I seek is how do I tell him not to contact me? I do not want to hurt him. Also, I think I should thank him for reaching out to me after all these years, how do I tell him I do not want to talk to him or see him although I am dying to meet and hug him againconfusion.

You should try to push yourself to go and meet your friend in our anxiety. We might think that people will judge us when they meet us. But in truth, this does not happen because people have issues and insecurities of their own. Once you meet your friend, you will definitely feel positive emotions.

If you can go to the doctor, please do. These signs are easily confused with anxiety attacks, but they could be a heart attack. Funny enough, I have been feeling the same since last night over some minor inconvenience in my relationship, and I have not recovered yet.

I get to pick up my first prescription tomorrow, and my and therapy appointment on monday. I know that it is not a fix. All but at least I get to try. I now finally have a semi diagnosis from my doctor, severe social anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder and mild depressionconfusion. It really helps me rationalize what I experience, just wanted to celebrate a step in the right direction. Happy face, or smiley

Thats awesome. I am glad you are getting help.

Title: Anxiety air hunger.
Thread
Hello so basically for as long as I can remember I had been experiencing what feels like the constant need to take deep breaths it basically feels like I cannot get enough air into my lungs to get relieving satisfaction of a deep breath thing is I have super bad anxiety and am always thinking the worst possible situation that can happen and I stress myself out a lot over it so ink if that is what causes my air hunger cuz when I am not thinking about my breathing patterns I feel it is more easier to control and get that satisfaction of a deep breath the feeling is still there but more controllable but once I start thinking about it, I panic a bit and I cannot for the life of me get that deep breath I have to constantly keep trying and I feel like I over breathe ina way if I had to say it happened in like the grade or freshman year of is im nowconfusion but I was in school distracted so it was not no where as bad but after I finished school that is when it got really bad. I use inhalers to try to ease it and sometimes it helps but never lasts it so mentally draining and when I have anxiety attacks, I feel like im dying and ink if it is just my brain created this permanent feeling of this air hunger but I wish it was gone. I also have a rapid heartbeat fromAnxiety and constant worry but got tests done on my lungs and heart a few years ago and everything came back. Fine. I am going to the hospital for it tomorrow. So I hope it is nothing serious and I can get it solved if anyone else feels this way. Ply comment and explain your story for it. Thank

Are you having panic attacks at this point? Maybe the air hunger could be if your hyperventilating breathing fastconfusion it could be causing you to feel like your not getting enough air because your blowing out all your co which can cause rapid heart rate, anxiety tingling hands I would still see a doctor but until your appointment if it happens again here is a tip you can try take a deep breath and hold it for seconds, then exhale slowly like your blowing up a ballon. This can help slow your breathing and help you not blow off co as much again. Still see your doctor so they can run tests and other doctor things hope you feel better soon.

I had exactly that as a symptom of my anxiety a few years back I can almost certainly tell you that it is in your head it just your brain playing tricks on you how I managed to get over it was by working on taking more productive breaths usually most of us breath by inflating our chest but it is not the best way to breathe as the chest does not leave enough space for the lungs to inflate all the way try working on breathing by inflating your belly instead to get better at this put one hand on your chest and one hand on your stomach and try focusing on only raising the hand on your stomach when breathing. This technique will also help you relax and ground yourself by focusing on your breathing. It may take some time to get used to it, but it has helped me a lot hope. This helps cheers,

Title: Tremor and shaking during accidents and the like.
Thread
Hi. This post is not a venting post. I genuinely need advice. So I was diagnosed with anxiety at the age of. Im currently confusion, and it is not really that harsh on me compared to others with extreme anxiety. But I still think this issue needs to be addressed. Somehow I take lithium one half in the morning and one half at night. This is just for you to know the level of my anxietyconfusion whenever something sudden or stressful happens, I immediately start shaking my hands, shake my knees, shake my muscles loosen up to the point where if I were pushed, I would be laying on the ground if I raise my hands forward and open my hands they shake enough for any person to notice. It is a bit abnormal. My muscles, especially my knees loosen up and I feel extremely weak. And this affects my daily activities and things that I do, like driving apart from the physical issues mentally. I feel like backing off and not getting involved or just staying my ground, even if im not at fault. This morning, I had a small car accident, and long story short, the other guy was at fault as he bumped into my car, and I got so anxious, I did not even take a picture of the scene or did anything to get him to cover the damage he did to the car. Really, my voice also starts cracking, and I try my best to avoid it, but that justMakes it worse. Same also happens during fights. Not that I condone violence or intentionally want to fight, but it happensconfusion. I get really shaky. Im well built with it height and broad shoulders and live a healthy lifestyle with bodybuilding and proper diet. So its not that I do not believe in my physical strengh, but something else. Im generally a nice guy, but we all know niceness alone. Never got anyone anywhere. A small side note. I also get anxious during phone calls with strangers that I need help from, like someone from my university or my trainer, like I said, I am not venting. I need advice on how to treat myself. How do I fix the tremor and can this anxiety be cured? I used to go to a therapist, but it is been about, or months since last I went

I had anxiety as a kid, but went undiagnosed until I was an adult. As a kid, it started, then poof, gone until now. I dont take meds at the time since so far. The ones I have tried havent agreed with me, as for when I am anxious, I feel a bit anxious all the time everyday, but I can still hide it and function. But lately, going out, being in public gatherings with friends or family or anyone visiting, work or even just getting ready will trigger it. Il range from mild hand shaking, feeling uneasy to the point. I dont have any control of my body what? So ever I cannot talk or move. I am a crying, snotty mess. I am aware, mentally, of everything going on around me for the most partconfusion, but physically, I am unresponsive to the point I have to be carried. Sometimes all I can do is just sit there shaking, uncontrollably crying. Sometimes itl last hours, leaving my body in tons of pain and heavy as fuck to the point. I cannot move and cry myself till I pass out. I think the body pain might be associated with my fibromyalgiaconfusion. My body tenses up. I feel weak all over, and my body just starts to shake twitch and tremor all at the same time. Its hard to describe the feeling in words. It feels like shit. Even when the attack is over. I dont want to deal with anything or anyone, yet. I want toBe comforted and hugged it leaves me feeling completely wiped out in every sense as for your question regarding the cure there is always medications you can take but even that will take tolls on your body in other ways not to say that some people become completely reliant and there is nothing wrong about that at all but its also not for everyone I feel you can try to meditate or see a therapist as for the tremors I too wish to know how to get rid of those but in all honesty the best advice I can give you is well to try and understand your body and the attacks learn to live with them and that even though it fucking sucks try to understand that it is okay and a part of your being everyone, anxieties ours a just a bit more sensitive and people dont understand it be they dont feel it. We get so caught up on how bad it is on us and the toll it takes that adds even more stress and anxiety on top of the anxiety def easier said than done. But take it a step at a time

Yes, your stomach may be upset because you are anxious. Try taking a cold shower. It stimulates you and refreshes your train of thought. Also, if you feel you could have an upset stomach, try drinking ginger ale or hot water.

I have the same fear sometimes this happens to me too, where if anything feels slightly off, I convince myself I feel sick but in reality, I am fine. I am sure your thoughts are just getting the best of you. The gas could just be something you ate or just normal old gas. Take some deep breaths and maybe play relaxing music to help you fall asleep.

Title: Anxiety attack.
Thread
I was not going to post anything. But at this point I am desperate as soon as I was about to go to sleep, considering the fact I have not been sleeping well, like at all I only got like hoursconfusion. After that, I started shaking uncontrollably. I have tried all I can tried to distract myself, but I have been shaking and feeling like this for pretty much hours. I am so exhausted, and everytime I get into bed to try to sleep, I end up shaking again and my mouth and throat go very dry. It is so irritating when im also very tired at the same time, does anyone else have any ideas what I can do to quickly calm it. I have already had a rescue remedy, and I drink small sips of water. Those are the only things that have worked. I am not even worried about anything, so I am not sure why it is this bad
Comments
Try tapping. Check it out on youtube. I find it very helpful for resetting my mind when I am in the throes of a big attack. Often we get stuck in a loop where we have uncomfortable symptoms and then get more anxious about the symptoms. So then the physic symptoms get worse, worry more and so on. Til before you know it, you feel like you are dying. If you can consciously relax your body and tell your mind that you are safe, it will help a great deal with your anxious thoughts. Its hard to do, I know, but focus on one thing at a time. Maybe the shaking. Tell yourself im going to relax and try to let your muscles relax. Once you realise you can relax, the shaking, your anxiety will calm a little

I have the same thing, but it comes and goes usually gets worse when I think about it, anxiety is super weird if you constantly think about it will not get better. If you try to distract yourself, it will tend to go away. Took my awhile to learn how to distract myself, though.

I have been feeling chest tightness and shortness of breath for around months. Now, in particular, at night, every single nightconfusion, I am used to my anxiety, so I managed to live with the physical symptoms, but the past few weeks have been terrible. I have been obsessing over it, waking up in the middle of the night feeling like I cannot breathe. Yesterday, I had the worst anxiety attack of my life because of this, and I was completely sure I was going to die because I could not fucking breathe properly. So yeah, I feel you. I am here with you. This fucking sucks. But it is somewhat comforting, knowing that other people experience it. Good luck.

I am confusion. I got diagnosed with gad on jan, had several tests. They came back normal. My symptoms were extreme anxiety, chest pains and arm pain. These symptoms kept coming back throughout the year and got worse on june, I got a horrible panic attack. Similar symptoms, but felt stronger than before chest and back pains, shooting pains in armband, veins of hands, spasms in stomach and chest, frequent pics, extreme sob, nausea, my tongue felt weird, tooconfusion and also little bit of pots. This was the time I started noticing symptoms of pots and also anxiety. Sob my he used to shoot up to bum by just standing up and used to be like that until I sat down, used to get worse, while walking upstairs, went to cardiologist till august, told him the symptoms got the tests again normal. He gave me medications for high. He symptoms got better. He stopped medications on october and told me to test if things got better and it did get better for month. At the end of november, my symptoms came back, but way worse now, I started to get this what I call as hungry heart. It felt gi, but ink. If it was, it felt gurgling or growling for chest that really felt like my heart, and the other symptoms were the same, but worse and also chin, or my jaw started feeling like it was clenching with other neurological symptoms, like twitch. Now, few weeks ago, I started getting chest pains again, butThey felt like previous ones, like anxiety, alot of shooting pains lasting for few secs in chest, arms, back, head, extreme nausea, really bad. Sob felt like it was coming from my right center chest, but it really felt like it was just my noseconfusion pots got worse. My heart beats hard, like really hard on normal range at rest too, which was really weird to me. Fatigue, constant butterflies or burning in my stomach. It was constant and weird cos, it was fluctuating my he my chin, used to feel weird like something or someone pressing it. My tongue feels weird like there was a constant bad taste to it. Painless, slow spasms in chest and stomach gurgling in chest felt like shit all the time and episode, which I still do not know what it was. It happened days after my second done of vac. It felt like really dull pain in the right side of the chest that only happened. I took a deep breath. It was not red or tender, like muscle spasm. So I went for cardiac tests again, weeks ago. I got an ecg and echo, and they came back. Normal, had a normal stress test few months ago. Now, in last days, my symptoms are happening often when I travel and after I travel, I am a really anxious person like, I think about pics, and they happen while travelling, especially walking.

Have you tried listening to a guided meditation or something like whim hoff breathing helps focus on the breath and get a bit of calmness? I know what you mean about having anxiety, but not feeling like there is a specific reason its so frustrating for me because by looking objectively at my life, I know I am very lucky and have a good life, but I still have days where anxiety is very overwhelming for me. And I do not fully understand why I get that way. Its a journey.

Anyone else here have any success with use of weed to help with anxiety

Now for all signs pointing to go for a indica strain, I am the opposite. Feeling slowed down and couch locked made my anxiety much worse it all about finding what works for you and can take some time learning what specific terpenes do and their profiles for each individual strain always helps. I strictly use sativa and I use the method of an oil pen. You can dose accurate so you do not get hit like a train out of the blue so if it is too little, take another small pull and etc. Best of luck.

Life feels like when you went somewhere fun as a kid like disney world, and its been hours and your sad that the day is over because you were having so much fun, I can even talk to my parents or brothers without feeling anxious. Its so feed. I talked to my physiatrist, but he literaly got up and went to get his papers while I was talking, and then he said, okay, is your meds working? I just almost wanted to break my computer screen and break everything I am so mad. What a joke. All the physiatrists I have been to were all terrible. What a king joke. I hate myself. I hate life, I hate my room, I hate anxiety, like I told him multiple times. I need anxiety meds. I am so numb, emotionless and lifeless feeling as if I cannot even move. I cannot even work. I am so slow. I am so unable, like a unlit candle waiting to be blown out. I am broken beyond words. I have no good memories, just bad life feels like it is moving to fast. For me, to process. I am to slow. I am to king anxious to talk to my parents, my parents. I am supposed to be comfortable with them, but I have forgot, because I keep pushing everything away. My to do list feels like million words. I have no purpose, no goal, nothing. I had so much empathy, sympathy. As a kid now im completely soulless, completely useless.Nothing makes me happy. Where did time go? I did not know life would feel like this. I should have been there for my brothers, but how? Anxiety, ok, anxiety. I need something please just a drug. I need to live. My lifes passing to fast. Time is to fast. It is going to fast. What the I want to just breathe. I cannot. I want to love myself. I cannot fake it. I am dead and alive. At the same time. Nobody ever loved me. I filled my older brother everywhere when I was a kid and we grew up and he rejected me. I did not have my parents to talk to because they were always fighting like screaming, then blaming it on us. I wanted to be older as a kid, because I thought I would have more friends like my bro, but it was a lie. I have been hurt to much. I do not want to try anymore.

Have you tried saris? Your doctor sounds like a dick, and a lot of people switch between, like, psychiatrists, before they find a good one. Sounds like you have pretty bad social anxiety. If you feel anxious talking to even your family, I completely feel you on all this as I have been going through the same thing, but no, as severe with talking to family, I was living in a car with my mom from to, and all my teen years were miserable being homeless now that I actually have a place to live. I have spent the past and a half years in my room all day on my computer because I am a nervous wreck around people just know that you are not alone and you are not a failure, and your life does have meaning. You have to surround yourself with positive people to be able to build yourself up. I also have a psycho mom with anger issues and faced constant neglect. As a child, I can totally see where you are coming from on this. I am so sorry you are going through this. And the main things on your list should be finding a new doctor and maybe getting out of that situation at home with the fighting and everything. The reason we push people away is because we are either scared of getting hurt or we feel that we are not good enough. I do not know if you have a medical history of being addicted to anxietyMeds but they should not be that hard to get for you. I hope you get the help and support and love you need friend, dont stress too much on your future and just try to live in the moment with the okay days you have you seem severely emotionally drained or burned out and that is why you might feel so empty and lifeless it will all work out for the better, though I know a lot of people that feel the same as you and it will take time, but eventually you will not feel like this anymore.

Title: Could anxiety be like a drug?
Thread
Okay, hear me out to start. I do not have a diagnosis for anxiety, so maybe I do not know what I am talking about, but I do feel very stressed out all the time. I have had different experiences that I cannot really explain from a full on. Cant breath crying? Feeling like im dying. Panic to a complete numbness and empty feeling after a sudden urge to cry in public place. But as a college student, I have found myself in the endless cycle of doing everything last minute, because it seems like I would rather drown in the stress and guilt of not going to class and studying then actually do it until I have used up every last second of the time I have, and it is too late to actually do it. Sure, you are thinking, then why do I do this instead of focusing of anything thing stupid insignificant thing or hobby I have discovered this week. Believe me, when I say, I do not know, and if I could, I would, I have tried everything from rewards to fake deadlines. But nothing has helped me out of this habit. Do I just enjoy anxiety and need a higher level of stress to make me do stuff? Has anyone else experienced? This is this normal? I am a just lazy

I have heard of people talk about how our bodies become accustomed to excessive amounts of cortisol that combined with the way our brains become accustomed to thinking passively, rather than intentionally, might leave you in a place feeling like it is the most comfortable place to be.

Panic to a complete numbness and empty feeling after a sudden urge to cry in public place. But as a college student, I have found myself in the endless cycle of doing everything last minute, because it seems like I would rather drown in the stress and guilt of not going to class and studying then actually do it until I have used up every last second of the time I have, and it is too late to actually do it. Sure, you are thinking, then why do I do this instead of focusing of anything thing stupid insignificant thing or hobby I have discovered this week. Believe me, when I say, I do not know, and if I could, I would, I have tried everything from rewards to fake deadlines. But nothing has helped me out of this habit. Do I just enjoy anxiety and need a higher level of stress to make me do stuff? Has anyone else experienced? This is this normal? I am a just lazy

You might feel like that, because that is what you are familiar with and take comfort in it, like if someone who was depressed their whole life, they will be addicted to the feeling of being sad and chase it, because that is all they have known.

These are all minor things but just want to know if you see them as aswell to see if I made the right call was with a girl months she was amazing every aspect everything I ever wanted and we were the same person got on perfect in every way she inspired me and wed so much planned for the future going ahead years she always said how I was the most important person in her life when we very started talking we had a big fight because of a guy she said he is tried it with her for years says she hates it and when I said how is he at it so long then she freaked out saying she is never had a thing with him before and never replies a month later she told me he texted her again I said I would deal with it she said no and that she was going to block him I said ok no problem. A week later she tells me he is text her again even tho he is meant to be blocked. I say nothing and ask to see what he said she avoids it, saying she is blocked him actually this time so cannot show me then shows me what he said only showing some of it tho and she was replying so again did not block him I gave out and she said shel deal with it herself next time and say nothing next day apologises and says how she isSo sorry and will make it up to me since that day I never heard anything my ex has been at me years but I have never wanted any of it truthfully and she knew that she made me block mine on everything because we ended on bad terms her ex texted her same day and said whassup I said he probably knows about us and she said yes he is done it before to try get back with me I told her to block him aswell because of that and she said she is not end of she does not need to because they finished on good terms the occasional time she would bring him up and talk good about him for example I would show a watch I wanted to get and she said how he has a red rolex and showed me shed show me his private story and say how his mam still get her christmas present nal odd time he would send me a video of a to show she watched and it would be a half cast guy captured sexy her ex is half cast last week she was at her cousins party and said she was going home at I woke up at half next day and it said she was last at the party location at I asked when she got home and she replied at ten saying she got home at and fell asleep straight away and to take her word over maps told her that isOdd and she freaked resulting in us splitting up now a day after we split up she is onto that exact ex I have been talking about do you think she was gaslighting and I made the right move I understand theres no hard evidence and could be worse I just want to know do you agree these were and I was better off to end things early because I had a gut feeling and was certain but now ink if I made a big mistake twink or smirk I ended with the girl of my dreams cause I feared red flags and did not want to get hurt more triangular flag

Hi. All. Looking for some insight, I was diagnosed with chronic anxiety.

I do have the he panic attacks, but I also will feel strange and see that I have a he no heart issues. I have been checked many times over the years

You can always have both such fun, but also anxiety presents itself different for everyone, as does depression. For me, anxiety has physical and mental symptoms headache tight muscles, chest pressure and pain tight throat feeling like I cannot breathe, dizziness, upset, stomach tiredness, etc. Mentally, it is constant worrying, sometimes to the point of panic attack, very self critical apprehension, fear, etc. Depression is losing interest in everything, being completely exhausted. When I wake up feeling numb, if you are not sure, I would raise it to your doctor and mental health professional. If you are seeing one, they often go hand in hand. Unfortunately,

Title: Concert anxiety.

Currently going through an agoraphobic phase where I cannot leave the house. And when I do, I am dizzy, hot and feeling like I need to pass out. I, for once in my entire life want to go and enjoy something fully. I have a concert in a few weeks, and the thought of it terrifies me and makes me want to sell my ticket. I am terrified of crowds. My ticket is barricade by the stage, so the loud noise, and of course, I am terrified of standing because ill pass out. I have passed out before with anxiety. I got right back up and was okay. Is this how everyone elses is where you go down and can get back up? Reasonably easy? I just want to expect the worse and know I am okay. If it happens, I am tired of living this way, and I really want to go have fun. But of course, anxiety and dizziness is just flat out, wanting none of that grinning face with sweat

Yes, I sometimes vomit when I am very anxious and regularly have lack of appetite because I worry I will vomit if I am feeling anxious something that is helped me a lot with that is that if I start to feel a bit nausea, I will put my hands gently on my stomach and often I will notice that when I am anxious I am actually tensing my stomach or sort of holding, restricting my breath. So I will make an effort to totally relax my stomach muscles and breath in that yogic way where you feel your stomach rise and fall, just recognising what your body is doing and making an effort to circuit break that can make a huge difference

Yes, theyare really closely linked. Its common to get nausea, diarrhea, and stomach pain. When you are anxious, it has to do with our fight or flight response. It slows or stops the body from digesting.

Title: The whole russia ukraine crisis is driving me up the wall

Hello, I am a freshman in college with autism and have been reading about everything going on in ukraine. I feel like this whole situation is getting worse and worse by the day, and the door for diplomacy is closing. I fear that a confrontation between nato and russia will eventually spiral into a nuclear war. I know worrying about this will not change anything, but that is exactly what I fear. No matter what happens, a nuclear war will come out of this situation. I am beginning to wonder if there is even a point in living our normal lives anymore. If anyone has advice on how I can cope with this whole situation or even some reassuring information, I would greatly appreciate it.

I have been on a low dose of buspar for a little over a year, and it has changed my life. My psychiatrist recommended it after I had a bad reaction to zoloft, seeing as it has little to no side effects. I was diagnosed with gad and ad. So it is helped tremendously when I am out in public, my face no longer goes numb from hyperventilating, and I do not feel like il throw up all the time anymore. If you are worried about side effects, I would not stress too much. Personally, I just felt like a zombie for the first week tired, zoning, outconfusion, but it went away quickly, a total walk in the park, compared to when I tried zoloft.

I ve been on buspar for about years, and while it definitely does help, I ve found that it doesnt work well on. It is own. I ve had it combined with cymbalta, and that worked pretty good until I had a really bad reaction to the cymbalta out of nowhere and had to switch. I switched from that to welbutrin, which, in combo with the buspar, takes care of pretty much all of my symptoms. Now, my anxiety is only really triggered in extremely stressful situations that would affect anyone. Of course, this is just my body experience. Meds affect everyone differentlyconfusion.

Title: I put myself out there I did not get the answer I wanted but I put myself out there and did not die like I was pretty positive would happen my entire life
Thread
Anxiety sucks. It really does, even though, objectively, I know certain situations are safe and cannot hurt me. I have avoided ever taking any form of risks, especially ones where I lay it all out there and have to wait for a response. Those situations have sent deathly fear down my spine for over two decades now, and it has cost me dearly. I have dated, but only in situations where the girl was the one to initiate the relationship. I have gotten good jobs, but only when I have been recruited and known I had an in the past two weeks following some progress in therapy and with medication. I have started talking to a girl where I have had to do most of the heavy lifting and initiating. And while I am not sure it will be something that turns serious, I put myself out there and did not die from embarrassment, and today I got wind that a really good position was opening up at my old company, and the hiring manager was my old boss, who I really got along with and liked. I agonized over reaching out to him all day, eventually sending a timed text and leaving my phone alone for an hour. So I would not stress over the response. Unfortunately, he did respond and say that because it is a highly coveted position. They have lots of internal candidates who get preference but said, if none of them decide they want it, or if they do not interview,Well, I will be the first person to know when the posting goes public. Now maybe he was just being nice. Maybe my worst fears about putting myself out there did come true, and he was laughing with the other managers about me trying to come back several steps above the position I left the company at three years ago. But maybe he genuinely is considering me if it opens. And even if he blew it off, the important part is I did not die. It did not hurt me to put myself out there. I have to remember this feeling because if I ever want the life I desire, I cannot allow my anxiety to keep me from going for it

Hey, so I have never posted on here before, nor have I ever really thought to visit anxiety on reddit. But I felt the urge to express this somewhere. I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks solidly for around two years. Although I have always been a very anxious person through out my life, I have recently been in therapy for anxiety and depression and have been given ways to cope with anxiety attacks. However, there is a side to my anxiety that I have had for as long as I could remember all around my health, I am almost constantly worried about my health, whether it is mentally or physically and it is beyond exhausting every time something very minor changes or happens to my body. My mind goes into overdrive, and I spend hours looking up my symptoms online and worrying over serious illnesses I may have that are untreated and could get worse. It causes a great deal of distress to me because of the fact that any small thing can trigger it, maybe a small head ache or a migraineconfusion, and it exhausts me. Most recently, I have convinced myself something is seriously wrong with my liver or gallbladder, because ive been having upper right quadrant pain with a feeling of bloating for a couple of days, the stress that fills my body when I get into a feeling like this is overwhelming, and it is currently almost am here, as I type this, and I honestly do not know whyIm even doing this maybe for some support or validation, someone to relate.

Hey, so I have never posted on here before, nor have I ever really thought to visit anxiety on reddit. But I felt the urge to express this somewhere. I have struggled with anxiety and panic attacks solidly for around two years. Although I have always been a very anxious person through out my life, I have recently been in therapy for anxiety and depression and have been given ways to cope with anxiety attacks. However, there is a side to my anxiety that I have had for as long as I could remember all around my health, I am almost constantly worried about my health, whether it is mentally or physically and it is beyond exhausting every time something very minor changes or happens to my body. My mind goes into overdrive, and I spend hours looking up my symptoms online and worrying over serious illnesses I may have that are untreated and could get worse. It causes a great deal of distress to me because of the fact that any small thing can trigger it, maybe a small head ache or a migraineconfusion, and it exhausts me. Most recently, I have convinced myself something is seriously wrong with my liver or gallbladder, because ive been having upper right quadrant pain with a feeling of bloating for a couple of days, the stress that fills my body when I get into a feeling like this is overwhelming, and it is currently almost am here, as I type this, and I honestly do not know whyIm even doing this maybe for some support or validation, someone to relate.

I have the exact same problem I have never related harder health anxiety absolutely kicks my ass for the past few months I have been in a constant state of anxiety first about my shoulder then my heart now my brain and spine literally any tiny thing sets off my anxiety I spend hours looking up symptoms too even though I know that makes it worse I always convince myself I have all these diseases and jump to the worst conclusions even having gone to the doctor and been checked out for a lot of things it has not helped me one bit I will say though it feels soo much better being on here hearing peoples experiences and realising a lot of people are going through the same thing as me talking to people who know the struggle really helps health anxiety is an absolute bitch because you cannot escape your own body or have any control in what happens and the panic attacks that come from it make you feel like you are on deaths door and the stress gives you physical symptoms, which causes more stress, which causes more symptoms, which causes more panic attacks it a vicious cycle currently awake at am here having not slept a wink and had a panic attack earlier because I have convinced myself I have got the most rare and serious side effects from the antidepressant I have been put on because of course I would be the out of people right we can get throughThis flexed biceps.

Most health related anxiety or belief that you are ill is not going to come to fruition. I had liver tests because of increased liver enzymes recently, but my liver was still fine inbox me for more details. If you want more details.

Long story short, I was abused a good chunk of my time in high school, and it is still bugging me to this day. Im confusion. I was regularly abused by the same group of people, but the main guy in the group was the one who would physically assault me whenever he got the chance and they were humiliating beat ups. This means that he was doing wrestling moves on me be, I was so small he was absolutely massive for a kidconfusion. He would literally hold me in the air with my feet facing the sky and slam me on my stomach while calling me the word consistently. Throughout high school, he bullied me on social media as well. Hed always apologize after abusing me, and I would believe him. Then he would beat me again, and the cycle continued. He reached out a while after high school to say, he is sorry, but I already knew it was a selfish apology to make himself feel better. I accepted it but told him I am not interested in started any type of friendship and told him to do him while I do me. He was very pleased by my response and wishing me well, and all I have entered insanity and cannot grasp the fact I have been abused. No one was listening to me when I tried to get help, and he is all good. Now, like nothing happened. After all the suffering, ive ditched my religion, which was my main source ofBeing forgivingconfusion and I have a heavy heart. I am feeling impulsive. Am I weak for always accepting his apologizes? Was I naive? How can I be smarter? I feel extremely insecure about these beatings so much that I have moved to a different state and deleted all my social media so no one can contact me or see where I am living.

In my opinion, you are strong for forgiving him. I would recommend seeking therapy if it is still bothering you this much, though.

I also suffer badly with health anxiety and I am also up at nearly am scrolling reddit to probably try and come across posts from people with the same symptoms as me I dont have much advice because I am in the same boat I have always been prone to anxiety specifically health anxietyconfusion but itsgotten a lot worse recently I would say speak to a doctor and they might request some basic tests that could reassure you enough to help the pain go away that if it is caused by anxietyconfusion then if the pain does not go away or the tests show something up you can take it further as for the day to day worrying about it though just know that you are not alone

Yeah, I am currently going through the same thing. I had been to the hospital around times this month because I thought my appendix was going to burst. I was having a stroke or I was having a heart attack. I have been trying to get better and I have taken tests that say, I have fine, but I keep overthinking it and still search up symptoms.

Did your anxiety go completely away? I have been having very bad anxiety, very bad sleep ringing in ears just twice, still freaks me out. Confusion, chest pain, indigestion do not feel good if a room is hot, fast, heartbeat, etc. Arm pain. This all started up again about two months ago and has not left. It had been a year since my anxiety has been this bad. Has anyone anxiety completely gone away? Or does it go and come back? I have gotten blood work. I used to have hyperthyearoidismconfusion eggs, etc. And everything is normal ranges, I guess, just looking for other peoples storys

Title: I want to branch out and make friends, but every time I try, I lock up and make a fool of myself.

Hey, hope all is well and thank you for taking the time to read this. I have been wanting to do this for a while. I have never been overly social and locked myself away in my room for a while, only having a few close friends, mainly being onlineconfusion. But over the past few months, I ve been thinking about going out and meeting new people to try and make things easier for myself moving into college and just overall making friends. I love the sound of going out places with friends and experiencing the life I ve neglected for years, but it is proving to be quite the challenge I tried testing myself to see where I was at by joining a social discord server and seeing how things went. All I can say is it did not go to plan whatsoever. So I hoped out of there real quick ha! Is there any tips to be more confident when starting up a conversation with someone new? Or does it just come with experience? Any help is appreciated

If you locked up and got nervous, I would see it and work with you to get through the hurdle. Be aware of others, and take the attention of yourself. Good people will find you believe that it will all work out and trust life.

Id say if you are not confident, just fake it til you make it. Confidence comes from experience and having positive people around you to build yourself up whenever you meet someone new, just completely be yourself. But act a little more confident than you usually do. I am sure people will not notice a difference you never know unless you try, and I hope you the best friend.

Confusion are you basic needs being met shelter, water, food, nutrition, eating, enoughconfusion, sleep confusion, movement getting outside for a walk, finding exercise you actually enjoy for me, it is cycling climbing weights, yoga and walking. Confusion do therapy for yourself. Journaling exposure therapy, understanding anxiety and figuring out the coping methods that work for you.

Exercise can really help, but it is more of a chemical thing in your body that is usually fixed with medication. Your hormones are fluctuating throughout the day, and the more and you have something called the amygdala that sends alerts to your body for potential danger. It gets misfired a lot for people with anxiety.

It is natural to feel that way, but changing your mindset will help. I have had similar issues and probably still experience it, but worrying about the future will not only ruin the next day, but also the moment you were enjoying.

When I feel content or happy, I believe I have missed something important. That is why I am so relaxed most of the time. It is work related. Are there assignments due? Did I forget to check some important reports? Did I check to make sure nothing would happen over the weekend?

You were not weak for forgiving him you have a huge heart and tried to see the good in him I am so sorry that you went through that is just terrible you may think that he has moved on and just forgot about it but trust me I am sure he thinks about what he did to you everyday things like that do not just go away even for the one who was hurting you he may have been going through things in his home life and taking it out on you that does not make what he did to you at all okay I just know a lot of times when someone becomes a bully it is because they are getting bullied abuse is abuse and no matter what it has already happened, you just have to learn to let it go have you ever thought of going to therapy itll be someone to talk to, who can trust, to listen and understand you meditation dont give that kid the gratification of ruining your future you should be on social media showing him how great your life is and how no matter what he did to you are out there living your best life while actually doing it we are not our past we are moving into our future every second of the day make it count red heart

Title: Anxiety about quitting a job I started months ago
Thread
The company I work at has been great to me in all ways except one. And that is pay for my industry and geographical location. I make an insultingly low salary. I just got offered a job, making more than what I earn I accepted. But this is busy season, and I am so sad to be leaving my employer so soon they are all very kind and laid back no toxic work culture and overall very accommodating. I am just really sad. How do I get over this anxiety? I am scared to give notice next week. Eta I have severe social anxiety and gad and am on meds for it. This is really hard on me. I feel like I am betraying them
Comments
I just recently quit my job and started a new one. I had a little bit of anxiety as well, because it is always hard giving people news they do not want to hear my best advice. And what I told myselfconfusion is to just be sincere and honest, tell your boss you would like to talk and then explain that it was a tough decision, because you genuinely love working for the company. However, you received a job offer that is too good to turn down to butter it up a little. You could say that you were not actively looking and that someone reached out to you. These things always seem bigger than they are in the moment. If they pay you insultingly low, they probably do the same with others. Companies that pay too low, typically have a higher turnover rate. They are probably used to this. You got this like I said, just be genuine

Same. I can do drinks, but even watching my friends get violently drunk makes me anxious because I know theyll feel awful the next day but then they do it again and again. With the heavy drinking, I like to have maybe one beer and smoke weed instead gets the good feelings going without the bad ones the next day. But of course everyone is different and should be extremely careful mixing drugs and alcohol of any amount.

Yes in the beginning it was or beers and I would be fucked with anxiety for maybe days now even non alcoholic beer makes me anxious the following day I love a craft beer but it just is not worth it any more I stopped drinking a year and two months ago with the occasional test beer to see if the situation had improved it hadn now I do not miss it at all did you know there is such thing as craft ginger beer ale and craft lemonades they are really good not sweet like coke and the other usual sodasconfusion and I find them a great substitute also you cannot beat a good mocktail I also find I am healthier now over all as I have lost interest in going to the pub so often and have found other activities to occupy my time it kind of meant a shift in the people I hang out with though as I have lost interest in going for drinks as an event I still do but maybe only once a month now and where my friends will only drink when out I get a meal its still fun but drinking as an event in its own right does not hold any appeal for me any more

No, I stopped for other reasons, but I agree sometimes during stressful or anxious periods, I think how nice it would be to have a few, but it is never worth it and never solves the issue causing the anxiety.

I find it hard to not drink during the weekends. Sometimes id drink during the week too, but I try to save it for the weekend this weekend is my first one sober in a while. And as I find it tough, I also feel really awful in many ways. I know I will feel better perhaps if I drink bit less often but its hard when I cant escape my mind in any way.

Oh yea! If I get drunk the next few days are reaally horrible. I was sober for a month, and as soon as I ended that I got super wasted and remembered very well why I quit now I am not sober but try to take it really easy. With the drinking, I do not think I am ready for sober life. So I am trying to find the balance, but after heavy drinking, I just want to die not from the hangover, but the extreme low for several daysconfusion, it is really horrible.

I have not been drinking much anymore be I get so anxious about embarrassing myself. And if I do embarrass myself, I end up thinking about it for weeks on end. If I go out, I will try to just have one or two and not get wasted. If I want to get drunk, I will do it at home alone, where I will not embarrass myself in front of a bunch of people I have ocd, and I obsessively worry about embarrassment. If you do want to drink, just have a glass of water in between to pace yourself so you do not get drunk. A light buzz is usually a better feeling anyway,

Im just a few days short of year free from alcohol. My mental health has never been better. Its been a long road, though. I am constantly offered drinks, and sometimes it is very tempting, but it is just not worth it. I have been accused of being boring and no fun anymore. My family told me that I just need to get over it. I would literally spiral into a panic attack the day after having anything to drink.

My demons and anxiety worsen a lot when I get plastered and I get into a very shitty mood, so I almost never get drunk anymore. Also, just because I am getting to the point where I do not find it very cool or exciting anymore. Rather, sit in a pub, have a couple beers and chill with my friends.

Lots of people have trouble quitting drinking because of the next day beer, fear. Beer. Fear is a biological chemical reaction happening inside your body. It can take alcoholics with anxiety disorders a few days or even weeks before the body readjust to consistent sobriety. People who want to stop binge drinking often have a terrible time finding a way to gently detox, and most doctors will not prescribe anything for post binge anxiety. Most detox centers are a mix between a pre school and a lockdown jail setting. It a tough situation for a person with an anxiety disorder to be in

I have been sober almost years drinking was not my biggest vice but I loved partying on the weekends in my teens and early alcohol cured my anxiety temporarily but it comes back way worse so it not worth it I do not miss feeling anxious and depressed days after it was never worth it I do miss how easy it was to talk to woman with a buzz sometimes laughing out loud but I would never go back

I am sad of not sure why a bunch of random negative memories I do not dwell on came up one stupid thing I had my weed vape clogged turned it on, was able to blow out excess crap that was clogged, just blew it into the sink and turned that water on too. Sadly, one of weeds side effects is paranoia. I was worried I got shocked or something I think I am fine but I did not know if my device got wet, definitely going to take a break. I do not know. Sorry guys been making a decent amount of posts pensive face with tears of joy grinning face with sweat, confused face

Weed makes me anxious and paranoid too. I only smoke it when I feel calm, avoid it if you are feeling significantly more anxious than usual red heart.

It became something that was never worth it anymore. The hangovers that lasted days together with the crippling depression plus, I tend to say the dumbest things and make silly plans when drinking the high really is not worth it anymore. I have stopped completely now for years.

I used to drink all the time and would frequently take it way too far. However, I started to get worse mentally, and my physical health was getting bad too. It hard not to drink sometimes, especially when I have to go out or something. But the longer I am clean, the easier it gets. I rarely have cravings. And that is good, because I used to want beer all the time.

Title: Head zaps and numb, tingly feeling in back of scalp.
Thread
Last night, I started experiencing and numbness and tingly feeling in the back of my head. When I tried to fall asleep, I started to get head zaps. Basically, my brain is firing a signal as I am trying to drift off to sleep that shoots all the way down to my stomach. They happen pretty frequently. But only as I am trying to fall asleep a couple years back, I had a night where I got the head zaps. Then I went and got a it scan and it was clean and did not experience it again until last night. I am not sure if it is anxiety or not, but I see a lot of people saying that head zaps can either be from coming off anxiety meds, which I am not onconfusion or just high levels of stress anxiety. I have not sent anybody talking about having both the numbness tingling in the head. So I am wondering if anybody else has had this. I have other issues, such as overactive bladder and stomach problems, as well as work, and go to school full time. So my stress and anxiety might be elevated
Comments
I have not had any numbness tingling in the back of the head until I started taking prozac. But I did have brain zaps throughout the day due to high levels of stress and anxiety. Very strange feeling. I felt super exhausted and fatigued, along with the brain zaps, too.

I do not yet. Hopefully, in the future with something I am looking into, antidepressants do not help me a whole lot either. I recently saw a video from a canadian study that said, cod can clog up the same pathway needed to break down many antidepressants in the liver. It may not be a dealbreaker, but just know it can have an effect.

It levels it out a bit. It does not completely alter or zap anxiety, but it does make it more bearable without destroying your ability to function like other re drugs and marijuana. Can I have been taking it for about years and have had zero side effects

Im on lamictal for bipolar disorder. Ive never really thought it helps with anxiety. I have a lot of anxiety issues, and I do not think I noticed a change when I started lamictal. Now I take buspar and vistaril for anxiety along with the lamictal, and it really has not changed much lol. One med that did help was lexapro, although I had to get off of it for other reasons, it could work for you. Id consider it if lamictal doesnt work out of every medication affects people differently. So maybe lamictal will help you. What dose did they put you on to start

Yep. Same with me after the super bowl and after valentines, felt like crap. The next day, stomach pain a bit lightheaded, and once I got home from work, took a good nap, I thought it was from mixing caffeine and alcohol with my bacardi and coke. But even these little vodka mixers make me feel like crap. The next day, I use to have light anxiety years ago, and couid screwed with my nerves, like many others, brought all that anxiety right back

I am laying down now with a cup of herbal tea on a saturday night. Nights alone are the worst I am tired of drinking to excess, alone or with friends. I have to admit I still binge from time to time, but I am well aware of the awful hangxiety the day after heavy drinking, and I can be crawling off the walls with a pounding heart and a huge feeling of dread. A hangover now usually wipes out the next day. Somebody here mentioned kombucha, and sparkling water couldn recommend them more. Get a soda maker and put a lemon wedge in it is glorious.

I am pretty similar I have never been much of a drinker and one of the reasons is that I quickly flip from relaxed to detached and anxious after just a drink or two and then my anxiety is usually also markedly worse the next day it too bad since I adore the taste of a good beer or bourbon. It especially frustrating when I am depressed and desperate for some elemental pleasure to break through the anhedonia, it would be nice to be able to just enjoy something

I was scared to go to the gym to when I signed up, they gave me a tour. In the beginning, I would just go right to the treadmill. I did not want to mess with equipment. I did not know how to use. But a month or so later, my brother joined, and when he went, I would use other equipment with him. The more I went, the better I felt, the people at the desk knew me and would say, hi, I definitely think you should set up some personal training sessions. That way you can get familiar with equipment and excercises. Those pal are there to help pal reach their goals. And not everyone who hires a personal trainer is in good shape. I always hid on the treadmill be. I didnt want to be seen, but it became a habit to go, and I eventually felt I belonged there. Nobody cared what I was doing when I was there. They were busy doing their things. I started to really push myself to use other equipment. Im so glad I did. Everybody has got to start somewhere. You can do it, make a change

Then couid happened, and then I started to get hospitalized and seeing so many doctors as since prior to couid, my body seems to break down, starting from getting non stop coughing, amp, wheezing for almost a year, which later diagnosed as cough variant asthma, which I manage with seretide nowadays.

I made a couple of attempts on my licence too. I personally had problems with it the actual driving part this was easier to resolve I just had to practise a lot before I got used to driving with less anxiety the test for the licence this was a hard one after I learned to drive I was driving everywhere and doing just fine but every time I did a test I bombed it I was just too nervous. My thinking was always black and white for example this is the last time or if I do not get this I cannot do it again or something like that but when I sort of gave up on passing I started treating every licence test as a practise round instead so I would go into the test as this test is a practise round and the examiner is just showing how the route will be. Once I started thinking of it as practise instead of a test I finally passed

After an acoustic shock, I got some kind of hypersensitivity in my hands and feet, also other places on my body. Sometimes can this be anxiety?

Yes, peripheral neuropathy can be a symptom of anxiety.

Title: I. So I was hospitalized for my anxiety.
Thread
This past monday, after not being able to sleep at all the past week, I had what felt like an anxiety attack as I was falling asleep. It felt like I was sinking, and I was just going to drop dead then. And there I got my aunt to drive me and my girlfriend to the er. This all started last month, right after got kvetch couid. But my anxiety just kept getting worse and worse to the point where I was having a hyperventilating panic attack everyday, where I would seize up and just lay there paralyzed, waiting for it to pass. Three years ago, I was also diagnosed with relapsing, remitting multiple sclerosis. So that also sets my mind on a path of thought that distressed me, especially when I begin to feel numb or like I physically cannot speak or move. I told the er doctor that I had been experiencing insomnia, decreased appetite, panic, shortness of breath, and just felt like I was going to stop breathing and die. Turns out that my blood work came back, saying that my troponin levels were high, not heart attack levels, but still pretty up there. So for the next four days, I stayed in the cardiovascular unit, hooked up to an iv drip of blood thinners undergoing every scan and test they could do on me, only to find that nothing was wrong with my lungs or my heart. And my neurologist saw me while I was in there to check up on meAnd make sure I did not have anything is related to worry about. I was able to get counsel with a psychiatrist while I was in there, and she helped me quite a bit. She helped me, at least keep myself from getting so worked up when there were more than two people in room with me that my heart rate would skyearocket. She also got me started on some meds that I hope will he will once they actually start to take effect. I am home now, and I have a follow up appointment with a therapist, psychiatrist and an appointment to establish a proper pop. But even though I know there is nothing physically wrong with me. I am still having some trouble with night time anxiety and sleeping. It feels like my sleep cycle has been knocked out of whack. I keep waking up in the night, confused or scared. Does anyone have any advice for me? This is just a frightening time. I used to struggle with anxiety and depression when I was a kid. But unchecked, it is gotten so much worse. As an adult, every new thing I feel scared me, even if it is something as simple as a weak urine flow

I am and had two strokes in october due to dissections in both of my vertebral arteries. The anxiety is pretty real right now, my neuro put me on paxil, which I reacted poorly, too. And it increased my anxiety because I felt like crap from it. Severe lack of appetite, nausea, dizzinessconfusion. I am tapered off it now, but my original anxiety about having another stroke and dissections again have returned to the point where sometimes I get dizzy, like I did with the onset of my stroke. And I panic until I realize it is the only symptom, and I move or focus on something else, and it stops dead. I have been looking for ways to help myself with anxiety, and honestly, I found that doing word searches through bouts of anxiety helped me a lot. They re pretty low brain usage and repetitive, but that seems to be what I need. I do not know if something like that or sudoku or another simple phone game would help you, but it is worth a shot. I have also gotten into the habit of staying awake at night until I am close to passing out. So I can avoid anxiety, causing me sleep issues, maybe mor the healthiest way to do it, though, grinning face with sweat.

So yesterday I was watching dead meat on youtube about movie kill counts then after the video ends, I got recommend by youtube to a video called brutality of a serbian film confusion its big wills video I think you need to watch it to understand me but I strongly advise not to do it or you end up like me too I clicked on. It was summarize video about a horror movie which its known by how gruesome it is now I can handle gruesome movies like saw but I didnt expect how its going to be gruesome and far too disturbing. It was especially that scene this scene im talking about traumatized and ruined me for the past couple of days. I lose my appetite quickly having a very difficult time eating and I cannot sleep. I need to forget it. I cannot concentrate. Im having anxiety I cant masturbate. Im a teenager, so I do it very often while doing it. This scene suddenly just comes up to my mind, and my whole body just stopped for a moment, and I get very nauseated and disgusted about myself, I ended up vomiting all over my bed. I scrolled through reddit searching for a way how to forget things, but it just does not work for me. Sometimes I just punch myself in the head. Everytime I think of it, im so sorry if this does not make any sense to you. I just really ned to get this thing out of my chest.And especially my head. I got a periodical exam tomorrow that I studied so much for, and I just cannot sleep or get this thing out of my head.

The only way to forget things is to actively occupy yourself with other things. Your memory does not have a selective delete function. Unfortunately.

I think the more you beat yourself up over this memory, the more it is going to reinforce those neurons in your brain and make the memory stick. I get it I read a guru manga once out of curiosity and every now and again the thought of it will pop into my head. It disturbing to me and I regret reading it, but the thoughts go away quicker if I just ignore it and focus on something else.

Yeah, I started having these about a month ago, and after a hotter hour, ecg and echo came back without any issues. Aside from ectopic, I am convinced these are due to anxiety manifesting itself as physical symptoms check out pics and convince your doctor to get tested, even though most likely these ectopic are benign.

I bet you will have a great time. Its normal what you are thinking. But trust me, people are not there to just judge you. Its also subjective. I bet you people will like what you wear. It is just that you might not. Thats not the census of the whole crowd of people go have a great time and bust out of the shell a little bit. A concert is a great place to do that. Youll probably never see anybody there ever again. So make it memorable, slightly smiling face.

Update for the it class. I got the best teacher yet for this round, he explained the objectives and the whys I need to do things whilst driving like steering, doing the ramp test for auto carconfusion, etc. Etcconfusion. And it helps a lot because most of my previous teacher actually just give me instructions and told me to remember how to drive around the circuits instead of actually teaching to drive still after the hours sessions today, I am now lying flat on my bed. I felt soo tired, but I glad I went it through with the great teacher, and now I just need to rest and recuperate for tomorrow session. All in all there is modules on the circuit that we need to pass. And he helped me not only get tips to get the driving done like side parking, point, turn, etcconfusion, he also did it in sequence, and it was first time ever a teacher help me see the whole circuit as a simple layout. Instead, just waiting for the instructor to give instructions. Where should I go next? I felt empowered and bit in control that I started to understand the mechanic of the driving and the sequence of the circuit instead of just following blindly tomorrow he will take me out on the actual road. I hope it will turn out great, too grinning face with sweat

Title: My the or the attempts at getting driving license.
Thread
I am in my plus of age already and in a city in south east asia where driving own car is kind of a necessity however I manage to live by with public transports or grabcar for some on you it is uber or maybe some other serviceconfusion or now that I married my so also drive me wherever I need to go if I too overwhelmed with couid to use public transport I have tried to take driving license up until I got the license learner licenseconfusion since after I graduated from my bachelor degree time at the age of I was not officially diagnosed with anxiety until last year I was diagnosed with severe anxiety disorder and of course with a dash of depression and couid anxiety too besides other physical symptoms of course including high be asthma which actually turn into chest pain most of the time ibs jaw clenching and teeth riding not the full list by the way, confusion sorry I just coping with taking things in joke mode in order to help avoid getting chest pain, shortness of breath, hyperventilate mode confusion I guess now I am on my oversharing mode. Aha okay now back to my driving license story. I have tried to get driving license and actually owned, or I think it is now him I love my forgetfulness symptoms soo much confusion from up until now pre couid time in I went to my the or maybe thconfusion attempt to get driving license with my step daughterShe turned that year, I was determined to finally see it through. Then couid happened, and then I started to get hospitalized and seeing so many doctors as since prior to couid, my body seems to break down, starting from getting non stop coughing, amp, wheezing for almost a year, which later diagnosed as cough variant asthma, which I manage with seretide nowadays. But if I got so much wheeze or mucus stuck in my throat, I usually check my pulmopeak before I take the rescue inhaler, because apparently it was my anxiety that trigger my wheezing most of the time. Instead of actual asthmaconfusion. In short, I got lucky that the government agency that overlook the driving licensing grant me extension to my learner license until end of june this year, I sent the request while hospitalized for ibs confusion. My step daughter actually have successfully gotten her license. More than a year ago, I was so happy for her during the time when all the driving school was closed due to couid, my husband actually help me to drive around the practice circuit near the driving school. And now I find out I really am enjoying driving around the circuit. Previously, I always gripped the steering, so hard or brake. So suddenly that hurt my chest, or simply too anxious to drive with the instructor, either on the circuit, or the actual roads. Even with the kindest ones I actually never manage to pinpoint what is the main reason why I have never turnedUp at any of the test for the or the time previously, although the first two time were truly due to scheduling conflictconfusion. However, my psychiatrist have discussed with me recently that since I was battling anxiety from long ago on my own, without med or diagnosisconfusion, it was possible that my anxiety kind of channelling.

Updates for and class actually I have fullfilled all the official hours for learning before couid, which is about almost years ago, and I could not recall any of the things I ve learnt. So I enrolled for additional classes of hour each to help me relearn for today. Lesson. It was full time on circuit, not outside road yet, so the instructor accompanied me for complete route of the requirements test points, and the he stepped out of the car and let me drive on my own while he walked alongside or observe nearby. Oh, actually, right before I leave home for the class, I got a mini panick attack today I have to take grabcar aka uberconfusion, and I was so nervous that my ibs was acting up. And just as I got a driver on his way coming over, suddenly I got a diarrhoea. I already took one pill of xanax after lunch, so I was just controlling the episode with deep breathing, while panicking that my driver already arriving thus, I was actually quite pleased at the end of the class when I manage to complete the circuit requirement about rounds without my instructor sitting besides me in the car. Although I struggle a bit during point and side parking, it time for me to sleep and recuperate, and hopefully I will not have any attack and do the class calmly tomorrow.

Title: Is this an anxiety attack?
Thread
I think I am having an anxiety attack. A prolonged one. Something made me anxious. It happens in general. For me, I am an anxious introvert, so it common for me, but I never had an anxiety attack. But this time, I am having difficulty in breathing. Even after hours after that, I cannot stop thinking I am having cold fingers. Is this an anxiety attack? The fear that this might be something serious is causing more anxiety, please someone help.

Yes could be an anxiety attack, but kind of sounds like a panic attack.

He also has anxiety and it destroyed his life but he is projecting onto me after I confusion developed a panic disorder last year when he found out how bad it actually was I thought he would be nice but he yelled at me and said some horrible things that honestly might put me into a depression for a while he said anxiety is a choice and that since my brain is like plastic, I can choose not to be anxious. And he said I am going to be a failure in life if I keep having panic attacks and he even said he will shove as many triggers in my face whenever possible so I can get the fuck over it. He also told he I wish someone beat the shit out of you right now. Maybe that would teach you a lesson on manliness. He also said, I am a disgrace to anyone who went through any actual ptsd trauma like marines or veterans. I told him he is verbally abusing me, and he said, im telling you this because I love you and want to see you succeed in life. The real world is rougher than I am, and I am trying to prepare you for it. And if this is abusive, then I guess every military sargent out there is an abuser ha see you cannot refute that you loose. Can I please have some support? The worst part is I need therapy and I cannot afford it unless he helps meWith insurance stuff. But I overheard my mom telling him this and he said, is it really that bad? She said, yes. And he said, well, I got to be fucking harder on him then before thats all I heard edit. Oh great.

Tactic tell your mother she needs to either make your dad stop or get you away from him or he might drive you to hurt yourself this is abuse tactic ask your dad to help you pay for martial arts lessons so you can get tougher find a teacher that also believes in meditation and centering and stuff this will possibly help your anxiety but most importantly it means you will eventually be able to out fight your dad so you can freely tell him to fuck right off and he will not be able to do shit about it

Your dad is a pos man. I am sorry if it is possible. Try to move in with family or relatives until you can find something of your own. What he is doing is literally the last thing you need exposure to. On the other side of that coin, it is sad that all of these older boys from gen and older were taught to bottle things up talking makes a man weak. All this macho horseshit. I hope he gets the help he needs. But as a parent myself, I always want better for my own babies than what I had he hurting not helping

Your dad is also struggling. That is why he is saying those terrible things. It is hard to hear these statements from our parents, as society teaches us to look to them for comfort, take care of yourself and get medical care from a physician, our counselor, you path to a healthier life can be found.

I think you already know this, and I am going to say it anyway. You are no less of a man, no less of a human being for having a panic disorder. It a very human experience. You are worthy, as you are from this encounter. It sounds like confronting your dad leads to stressful situations. You may need to change your behavior around him to protect yourself. It was really brave of you to call him out, though it sounds like it escalated threats from him. He not able to be a caregiver for you right now. And that suckswink or smirk. So see what you can do to work with your mom. I am really sorry that you are going through this the next few months may be rough, so please be gentle with yourself. I believe you have what you need to find healing. Be kind and be patient

Your dad is ignorant. Af especially if he had extreme anxiety. Sorry, you are going through this. Panic disorder is crippling, but it is something you can fight. And sometimes without medication, if you make some important lifestyle and diet changes, you do not have to be fat, to be unhealthy, fuel you body better, and your mind will also feel the benefitsconfusion. What helped me a lot was reading books on anxiety and panic. Know you are not alone. Know how your body works and why it reacts the way it does. Knowing really is half the battle. Good luck to you, and do not forget there are anxiety support phone lines you can call

My grandparents were the same way to my little sister she is almost. She told them she was depressed and suicidal. They did not believe her. She sought out a counselor and told them she was suicidal in front of our grandparents. It took them hearing it from a counselor saying, yes, she is depressed. She needs meds or therapy and she is suicidal to actually wake the hell up and realize mental health is real and needs to be taken seriously or they could actually lose. They are granddaughter, im sorry you are going through this. My messages are always open

First of all I am sorry that he is treating you that way it is not easy to have a loved one beat you down when you are having some mental health problems secondly there is no measure of manliness that you have to live up to hiding how you feel or just acting like things do not bother you does not make you tough men have feelings just like every other human does there also is not an olympics for anxiety and trauma your anxiety and mental health issues are no less real than a soldier who served in afghanistan it takes courage and strength to admit you have issues suppressing your feelings may work in the short term but it can make you bitter and closed off from the world, making it harder to connect to people you do not have to do things alone you can talk through things with people. The world is a tough place, but it is much harder alone than it is together and you are not alone

I am feeling like this too and I am only making like an hour I and you need to stop feeling this way because most people are not as hard on us as we are, but people do not like being around someone who is always anxious or depressed.

Woodworking is accessible in demand, and you can do it alone if you like, probably not getting rich. But this career has completely changed my life. I am proud of how I spend my days. It took me until I was to find my purpose. But hang in there and be interested in what you care about. Not expectations. Good luck.

Title: Male dealing with sexual anxiety any tought on how to overcome

Hey, everyone I think I all need to write the whole story to be able to get the most reliable answers and advices and I honestly grateful to everyone who will read my story. Firstly, I am dating my current of for about months now and for the past we tried to have sex a few times but I could not get hard or mantain the erection for enough time to do it. I have not had sex for the past years if that relevant because I have been in an exhausting relationship who made me to look for a break from dating for about two and a half years a relationship in which I was able to have penetrative sex without any problems. After those years, I ve been in a weird and unstable relationship with someone and we have not manage to have sex because she didnt trust me enough to do this, and she had some past sexual traumas with men, and I was supportive and accepted that with her for about a few months of an on and off relationship. Then we decided we cannot be together because she was not ready for commitment. I mentioned the last relationship to mark that when I had some kind of intimate moments with that girl, I had normal erections with no problems at all, that happening about a year ago, after that in the last year, I decided I going to stay single until I find someone who I think is the right personFor me and I found her about months ago we have an amazing relationship she a stunningly beautiful and sexy girl I honestly envision a future with this girl cause she makes me feel things I ve never felt I feel home when I with her and I already told her if soulmates exist she my soulmate I basically love everything about her and what we have but I just cannot get hard with her when it comes to normal penetrative sex if we re just foreplaying or have other types of sexual intercourse like oral sex everything works fine my erection is up and working as normal but when one of us mentions something about trying to have penetrative sex something happens with me and I cannot keep it up long enough we have an okay ish sex life even without the penetrative sex because we can climax even without the penetrative sex cause we have an amazing connection and chemistry and great hand oral skills but it kills me inside cause I know we both want to get to the next level of intercourse and I just can do it. I ve done some hormonal bloodwork last august over some hairless problems and everything was on point and I get morning overnight erections daily the first tought I had when this happend for the first time was it is because I didn wanted to flop it I had basically no confidence when we tried to do it for the first time because of theYear sex break I had and the lack of confidence probably made me fail for the first time but then many thoughts appeared through the time I was thinking that I all lose her if I can manage to get it up or that she all probably get sick of my problem and tell me that she can take it no more so I decided to tell her my negative thoughts and she was very supportive telling me that she loves me and even if she wants to have normal sex with me she not going to leave me for that and that we re going to get through this together and that was a relief for me at that moment but I still think that in my head there more pressure because after that discussion we had we tried to do it again and still didn work again. She was very supportive and told me that she wants me to feel safe and loved and reassured me that she is not leaving, but I think that not the problem. Now the problem is im thinking this will happen again when we try to do it, and im going to embarass myself and her again and again. Any advice on this would be very much appreciated. And if you have questions, im up to answer any question. Thanks for the time of reading my whole story.

Title: Heart forgets how to heart when laying down.
Thread
I have been struggling with palpitations and arrhythmia for several weeks. I am currently strapped up to a hotter to help get to the bottom of it. My problem is bigeminy or frequent extra double beats during the day, while I will sometimes get extra beats here and there and feel a light flutter. This is more when I am bending over or taking a deep breath or something that makes more sense that my heart would react. Somehow, nighttime is a completely different story, though, as soon as I lay down, my heart might be ok for a couple minutes, but then it starts to go completely out of wack flutters, extra beats, slowdowns. Sometimes I will feel something going on as often as every other beat. This can last for hours as I lay in bed trying to sleep. If only I could simply ignore the sensation I would have the best sleep ever, because I am so tired. But when your heart is flipping around in your chest every seconds it is extremely unsettling. Often times, sitting up for a few minutes will help, but as soon as I lay back down, it will kick off again. One thing I did notice, though, once I finally fall asleep, if I wake up during the night, my heart is beating just fine, perfect rythm. And speed, despite the fact that I am laying down, it almost like the plane is flying itself a lot better. Once the pilot leaves, sorry, had to vent, iHave to wear this hotter for days. And I am scared I might have something wrong with me, hoping to share experiences with some others. Good luck to you all.

Let me know how this goes, glad you are getting it checked out. Probably something I should do, too. I am having almost the exact same experience. You are not alone.

Title: Please help need advice.

I have been in and out of hospitals recently had couid long story short im concerned about myocarditisive had about every test they could run, besides an mri and doctors are saying its not myo my anxiety stems from fear of dying im terrified they haunt found myo and im just going to drop. My doctor office has video visits and I have talked to one no multiple times about my concerns and shes so sweet and said this was a huge work up and something would have been found and I take comfort in talking to her but as soon as the conversations over I start freaking out again. Im still having chest pain, tightness, palpitations, some sob, high heart rates when standing im scared to shower sleep or be home alone or exert myself at this point I dont know how to convince myself im ok when everything feels so wrong. They gave me buspar to try, but im terrified to take it. I didnt even know myocarditis was a thing until after couid now im convinced I have it. I dont know what to do. They doctors have been trying to reassure me, but I dont know how to convince myself im setting up out patient help, but im just so scared. Can anyone offer any advice
Comments
I have posted this before and it seemed to help to my knowledge the rate of myocarditis cases caused by couid infections is cases per million infections so a chance of you suffering from it so you have a chance of being completely okay even if myocarditis does appear I have heard many cases are mild and resolve themselves after some time youll be alright. Mate draw dots in red, then draw dots in green. I almost ensure you after a couple hours you will realize how insanely unlikely it is you will suffer myocarditis

Title: Anxiety, giving a need to be perfect to control.
Thread
Do people recognize this? I constantly feel the need to be perfect, to live up to a standard that society sets for me, that there is an ideal way to be, and everything else is useless and dysfunctional. It gives me the feeling that I constantly need to strive to be perfect. And if not, I am facing dire consequences. I suspect it comes from being bullied in my childhood, not being perfect, not living up to the perfect standards the other kids set for me had really bad consequences for me. I see the world in a black and white. Now, my fear of being bullied, abandoned, ostracized, is making me want to control everything. Understanding everything needs to have a purpose, be usefull. Otherwise, it feels pointless to me. Things need to have a meaning. But the more I think about life, the more I conclude there is no inherent meaning to life, nothing to strive for. There is not point to it. I do not know how to deal with it. Do people recognize this and have helpful tips
Comments
Yes. And let me know if this is too much, but it is all bullshit, all of it, youll never be able to please everyone or do everything perfect. And the faster you learn that the better off you will be, its liberating to know that you can never please or do everything perfect. But that is actually ok, and nobody is going to fault you for it, because they do not care either.

You do not get rid of it. You just learn how to manage it. Anxiety is the minds way of dealing with something, but it was not always that way. Its like you are driving down a road, and something is coming up ahead. You have two choices on where to go. Anxiety is one way, and excitedness is the other. At some point in your life, your brain started directing more traffic to anxiety. Rather than excitedness, you have to learn how to redirect the traffic. Pick up the book. Dare on amazon, it goes through all this. Everyone gets anxiety. It is just how you deal with it. That makes the difference

Hi. Just over a year ago, my of broke up with me because she needed to focus on herself. But then a month later, she replaced me with someone else. I have pretty bad anxiety. So this led me down a dark place because I was to afraid to go outside in case I saw her. It took me a few months, but I have moved on from her, but I still have really low self esteem to the point where I cannot talk to new people because I hate myselfconfusion and I have some bad days because I still feel the sadness and anxiety from being replaced by someone I loved. Do you guys think I should go and talk to someone about this? Or do you think I should focus more on tackling my anxieties to help boost my self esteem?

Title: Anybody here have a child failing a class of an uncooperative teacher?
Thread
My daughter has extreme anxiety and also has been sick for a good portion of the school year. Her illness is not wholly because of her anxiety, but some of her symptoms are believed to be causing some of her health issues. As a result, she is not doing her best in her classes. The math teacher, in specific has been very difficult to deal with. She will not accept my child late assignments and will not respond to my request for a conference to try and see how I can help my child succeed under the circumstances. I have contacted the counselor and have not gotten a response there either. My daughter is very bright, but she is having a tough time. I do not want to be hard on her, but her dad is another story he thinks she should be doing well in every class, not just some. In spite of her issues. I am at a loss for what to do. I have reached out to other teachers who were willing to accept her late work but not grade it on a full scale. And I am grateful for that. My daughter did get discouraged to the point that she was giving up. She fell into depression along with her anxiety and had some pretty low esteem and thoughts about herself. Any advice on what I can do, many of her teachers are incompetent to say the least, I have reached out to a private tutor that will start working with herIn math in hopes to have a better time going forward. However, this quarter is about to end and I do not have much time to try and make things better. I do not really expect the teacher to give my child a pass, but a little bit of understanding that this year is hard on her and being open to accepting a few late assignments as well as giving me advice and insight on what is going on in class is not too much to ask.

Hi. Teacher here with gad depression, have you taken your daughter to a psychiatrist therapist? Honestly, that is, step one. A lot of students are struggling right now. I think taking care of her mental health at this point is more important than grades. This is for if you are in the us, if she has an official diagnosis, she may qualify for a. If her anxiety prevents her from participating in school, a would basically give her accommodations in the classroom depending on what her other health issues are. I would see if she qualifies for any right now, usually, you would reach out to her. Counselor. For this in my district, we have school psychiatrists too. So if you requested testing, they would do it at the school. Not all schools have this. So I am not sure if your daughters would, but it is worth talking to the school about at this point, her math teacher does not have to accept late work. Yes, it is the right thing to do, but no, it is not required. However, the math teacher should respond to your request for a conference. I would follow up with a phone call

I repel my anxiety as much as I can. I really push myself so hard to repel anxiety, but it is still persistent, and this battle is going on forever.

Title: My dad says me having anxiety makes me a say and not a real man.
Thread
He also has anxiety and it destroyed his life but he is projecting onto me after I confusion developed a panic disorder last year when he found out how bad it actually was I thought he would be nice but he yelled at me and said some horrible things that honestly might put me into a depression for a while he said anxiety is a choice and that since my brain is like plastic, I can choose not to be anxious. And he said I am going to be a failure in life if I keep having panic attacks and he even said he will shove as many triggers in my face whenever possible so I can get the fuck over it. He also told he I wish someone beat the shit out of you right now. Maybe that would teach you a lesson on manliness. He also said, I am a disgrace to anyone who went through any actual ptsd trauma like marines or veterans. I told him he is verbally abusing me, and he said, im telling you this because I love you and want to see you succeed in life. The real world is rougher than I am, and I am trying to prepare you for it. And if this is abusive, then I guess every military sargent out there is an abuser ha see you cannot refute that you loose. Can I please have some support? The worst part is I need therapy and I cannot afford it unless he helps meWith insurance stuff. But I overheard my mom telling him this and he said, is it really that bad? She said, yes. And he said, well, I got to be fucking harder on him then before thats all I heard edit. Oh great. Now he is having a panic attack and wants everyone to treat him with special care and take his anxiety seriously.
Comments
Anxiety is horrible but you need to forget what he said and work on things yourself hes right in some ways in the fact that you need to stop complaining and take control of your life he could of been nicer and more supportive but it is the truth you have to man up and put in work to get better its not easy but you can do it through counseling medication and places like here he wants you to stop making excuses and take ownership of it its hard advice but it is the truth

Benzos are fine short term I would start with ativan, but know that it is going to make you sleepy. Xanax will do the trick, but it is half. Life is shorter than klonopin. So really just depends on the severity of your anxiety.

Definitely recommend gabapentin as well as propanol. I take both daily as needed usually do not need to on weekends, but I take them before my morning shift during the week, and it makes me feel like a different person. Gabapentin has seriously been a lifesaver for my social anxiety and dealing with superiors, while the propanol helps with my physical symptoms, like my tremors and high heart rate.

I used buspirone for awhile before getting a formal diagnosis daily med regimen. It worked okay for a good while.

Buspar is also very successful and more likely to be prescribed than a benzodiazepine hydroxizine also might be prescribed, as well as discussed in another commentconfusion. Hope you feel better frown sad, angry or pouting.

I took lorazepam as needed. It absolutely helped. The risk of addiction is always there, but it never happened to me, and I ended up not needing it or needing it very rarely, I was on the lowest dose.

I currently use my klonopin for my as needed anxiety panic attacks if it is too bad I take my husband also uses klonopin as well but I think he only takes the my I also take lunesta at night which is amazing I will have panic attacks at night if I do not take something I have tried. Buspar made me even more anxiousconfusion and hydroxide, spelling incorrect but it did not do anything for meconfusion. I also tried xanax twice and it made my heart beat out of my chest and made me super dizzy. So never doing that again. My mother in law takes tranxene and she does great on it.

Honestly it depends on the anxiety you experience often times a simple benadryl can do the trick without getting into harsh and addictive benzos

I was having anxiety issues and panic attacks for several years. Lorazepam was my go to medication. It sure helped, but I was never easy taking it because of its addictive potential. Then I found out about cod and gave it a try. It took me some time to figure out how to dose it now it is all I ever take, and it helps me a great deal. I do not know details about your condition, so this suggestion might be way off. Maybe consider it, though.

I have been on a few over the years and pins work best for me. Also, remember, as needed, only treat the symptoms not the cause you should focus on attacking the cause of your anxiety long term.

Title: Is mental health an emergency.
Thread
So here is my little story. I think I suffer from depression, anxiety and adhd but never been diagnosed. So because I never saw a therapist or psychologist, I have been short of money for months because I stopped working in october, so could not really see any doctor. I managed to gather some money and was finally able to call for an appointment with my family doctor so he could lead me to a therapist. This way, I will not have to pay, has much as I would have for a therapist. I was so happy I have been waiting for month to see a therapist. I just want the pain to stop. But when I called to make an appointment, the secretary asked me what was the purpose of the appointment? And I told her that I would like to keep that between the doctor and myself. After that, she told me that my case was not an emergency and that I would have to wait for a month to have an appointment. I usually have to wait for at most or days. It just does not make sense to me. I just want to heal. I know one month is not much of a big deal, but I have been waiting for months to be able to see a therapist, and it is just making it worse now that I have to wait another month. If I call back and tell her that is it is for mental health issue, would she considerGiving me an appointment sooner.
Comments
I imagine that when it comes to therapy, an emergency would be an immediate danger of suicide. I do not think saying it is a mental health issue would help. She is probably even presuming it a one month wait is actually pretty good.

Title: Let the panic do the damage how to surrender fully.
Thread
I always read how we should surrender to the feelings of panic in order to stop making them worse by resisting and prove to ourselves that they are safe. But I always did it wrong. I was trying to surrender as a kind of technique to make the feelings stop the mantra that is working amazingly well for me is let the panic do the damage, whatever it wants to do, let it. I give you a kind of meditation to demonstrate the mindset. Imagine you are on an operating table you have heart cancer, and the best surgeon in the world is your doctor. You trust him. Unfortunately, the best doctor has the worst anesthesiologist he gives you an anesthetic that makes it impossible to move, but you can still feelconfusion. You would not want to move. Of course you are being operated on, but it is scary and painful. You feel tons of strange sensations feel like your heart will explode, feel like you are constantly on the verge of passing out. But you know the doctor is the best, so you sit and let him cut you. Trusting him perfectly. Whatever you feel, it is for the best, even if it feels like it is killing, you do not want to direct the feelings you do not want to stop them. You want your heart cancer gone. So basically allowing the panic to do the damage is terrifying at first, but also pleasant in a way no matter what it hits you withYou are fine allowing you go crazy do it you die, do it your friends will think you are weird sure do it confusion you want to be able to take the full force of whatever hit the panic attack is giving you re not calling its bluff it is not bluffing it kill you the false you the you build on resisting it let it and let it reveal its own inability to do anything else doing this is pretty intense but you can come out the other side feeling incredible it triggered a kind of ego death in me for a time like a full saori state where I felt emotions I have not felt since I was a very small child. It works well on tons of other emotional pain as well. Any time you feel like defending your identity because you have been emotionally hit stop and let the pain do the damage. All that it can really damage is resistance itself.

It works well on tons of other emotional pain as well. Any time you feel like defending your identity because you have been emotionally hit stop and let the pain do the damage. All that it can really damage is resistance itself.

Title: Let the panic do the damage how to surrender fully.
Thread
I always read how we should surrender to the feelings of panic in order to stop making them worse by resisting and prove to ourselves that they are safe. But I always did it wrong. I was trying to surrender as a kind of technique to make the feelings stop the mantra that is working amazingly well for me is let the panic do the damage, whatever it wants to do, let it. I give you a kind of meditation to demonstrate the mindset. Imagine you are on an operating table you have heart cancer, and the best surgeon in the world is your doctor. You trust him. Unfortunately, the best doctor has the worst anesthesiologist he gives you an anesthetic that makes it impossible to move, but you can still feelconfusion. You would not want to move. Of course you are being operated on, but it is scary and painful. You feel tons of strange sensations feel like your heart will explode, feel like you are constantly on the verge of passing out. But you know the doctor is the best, so you sit and let him cut you. Trusting him perfectly. Whatever you feel, it is for the best, even if it feels like it is killing, you do not want to direct the feelings you do not want to stop them. You want your heart cancer gone.

What you said is true. The panic and the anxiety are terrifying to feel, but in all truth, anxiety is a natural sensation whose original purpose was to help with survival. It can overreact sometimes and fill us with dread or fear. But we have to remember that it is not acting out of any maliciousness. It is all just good intentions gone wrong. Folks have to learn to make friends with their anxiety, to be able to sit right beside it. No matter how uncomfortable it feels, youre then able to better understand where it is coming from and why. And then after that, you are able to work on moving past it

You will never see those people again. No one is laughing, and if they are, fuck them, everyone has screwed up behind the wheel. You just happened to actually make contact with another car. Think of all the actual fatal collisions that happen every day and try to just be thankful you did not end up in something more serious. I get this type of anxiety too. Usually it is related to something I said that I wished I should not have, and I will think about it that night when I am trying to fall asleep, chances are, I am the only one who really cared or remembers. That is the funny part. Sound familiar. Do you think those people are still thinking about the weak car collision they saw face the embarassment in the moment, learn dust off and start a new chapter

Title: Anxious anxiety feelings
Thread
Recently for the past month I have been really having bad stomach churns and a sickening anxious feeling when I wake up and because of that I find myself waking up way early then usual and from this I never wake up early and for some reason it had felt like I had never slept, making me feel tired I also find myself just crying at least times a week or day and after crying I act like everything is fine when it is not. I have been the one to always bottle up my feelings ever since I was a teenager and I had never cried these past months then ever does anyone know what I should do I am really bad at opening and confronting my feelings

Title: Can you imagine a life without worry?
Thread
Try it right now. Whether it be relationships, career health, future, think of any worries related to them, and then just stop, say you are worried about whether to go somewhere to night and what will happen if you did, or you are worried about saying something to a girl or that your career will go bad, that a disease or ailment is around the corner. Stop it right now and just do things as if these worries do not exist. The live in the moment plan for the day and do them with a little and analysis. Busy people generally do not worry a great deal. They are too busy to do this

Comments
I have taken propranolol as needed before it helps to lower your heart rate, and I felt like it made my heart feel more steady. However, if you feel anything else from your anxiety, like nausea, it does not help with that. I took it a little while back before an event that was making me super anxious. And while it did alleviate the heart related symptoms, I still felt super nauseous and panicky. I have not taken it since woman shrugging.

He also has anxiety and it destroyed his life but he is projecting onto me after I confusion developed a panic disorder last year when he found out how bad it actually was I thought he would be nice but he yelled at me and said some horrible things that honestly might put me into a depression for a while he said anxiety is a choice and that since my brain is like plastic, I can choose not to be anxious. And he said I am going to be a failure in life if I keep having panic attacks and he even said he will shove as many triggers in my face whenever possible so I can get the fuck over it. He also told he I wish someone beat the shit out of you right now. Maybe that would teach you a lesson on manliness. He also said, I am a disgrace to anyone who went through any actual ptsd trauma like marines or veterans. I told him he is verbally abusing me, and he said, im telling you this because I love you and want to see you succeed in life. The real world is rougher than I am, and I am trying to prepare you for it. And if this is abusive, then I guess every military sargent out there is an abuser ha see you cannot refute that you loose. Can I please have some support? The worst part is I need therapy and I cannot afford it unless he helps meWith insurance stuff. But I overheard my mom telling him this and he said, is it really that bad? She said, yes. And he said, well, I got to be fucking harder on him then before thats all I heard edit. Oh great. Now he is having a panic attack and wants everyone to treat him with special care and take his anxiety seriously.

Just in case you need a normal meter for perspective. The way he is treating you is not normal, acceptable or healthy. You deserve better from him. Family is supposed to be a shelter from the cruelty of the world. And right now, he personally sounds worse than what the world is going to throw at you.

Your dad is clearly struggling and putting it on your shoulders. His behavior is not okay, but it is got nothing to do with you and everything to do with him. Chances are his dad told him the same shit growing up, being a man does not mean anything, really. As a woman, I do not look down on men who are open and honest about anxiety. I actually like men who can be emotional and vulnerable more than I like guys who think shedding a tear is worthy of getting their man card revoked. Dont listen to your dads insults, get some therapy and medication. Itll do wonders for your mental health. And hopefully your dad will see that I know my dad has suffered from rather extreme anxiety his whole life. Instead of listening to toxic masculinity, he got help for it and is doing much better. Hes still just as manly as any guy. I know

From experience, he probably has more issues than you, but he doesnt accept them or treat them, and instead decides to pay it with you all because he sucks. My dad is the same. Dont let that shithead ruin your life. You deserve better.

Your dad an ass. You re allowed to have emotions, and obviously you got the anxiety disorder from him, therefore he cannot criticize you for it. Just having an anxiety disorder does not make you not a real man. Men are humans. You re allowed to be human and react to life based on your anxiety disorder. Your dad has the problem of toxic masculinity.

Im surprised your still so intelligent with your words, after all that horrible shit, how he talks to you is baffling to me. That is not normal. Fuck, I dont hear good shit from foster homes, cause of the heartache, but I think you should set up your chain of events to happen there.

Don listen to a word. He says he is absolutely wrong about anxiety and what it means to have fear or mental health problems if he cannot understand how to deal with his own problems, he sure, as hell, cannot understand how to help you with yours. I am really sorry. You are going through this with a family member, especially your dad. Parents should be more supportive than this, and in his mind, maybe he thinks he is, but its probably hurting more much more than he thinks. It honestly, really impressive that you can identify when he is having a panic attack, because that is half the battle, even when you are going through it also gaslighting you and making you think there is nothing to panic over. I know how hard it is to deal with that toxic masculinity and have it shoved in your face. There is nothing wrong with experiencing fear. It is actually just the bodies way of coping with stress in a dangerous environment, sort of like if you are being chased by a bear, but there is not actually anything chasing you. There is not reason to compare yourself to other people and their ptsd, or panic disorders, either. Your mental health is your issue and is just as valid, but you are doing the right thing by seeking out help. There are crisis lines you can call if you are having a panic attack and want some support. The I helpline is available monday through friday. ATo I est I confusion if you can try to talk to your mom about a therapist and maybe she can help you pay for it. As far as your dad is concerned, he does not need to know anything about your mental health. Aside from maybe that you need to talk to a therapist, your mom can handle thatconfusion, but he does not need to be involved in your panic or mental health. It may be beneficial to just cut him out of that part of your life and distance yourself, because it does not seem like he can even handle that type of thing. Another suggestion is maybe you can try to contact a close relative if you have any explain the situation and see if they can help you out with either finding a doctor or staying with them for a time. If the abuse continues, do not feel like you have to stay there. If there is a better place to go, take the opportunity, even for a short time. Good luck. And I hope things get better. I know they will be better eventually. So keep that in mind

My lizard brain says you should kick him while he is down the next time he has a panic attack and call him a pussy and say, you wish someone would beat the shit out of him. I mean, I do not think anyone would blame you for doing that, but you probably should not. Lol just remember everything he is saying is wrong, and you should not care about what a hypocrite like him thinks. I know it is not that easy, but I hope that thought can bring you a little comfort when he is being cruel to you. Hes in the wrong, and he is a fool.

First off, all your dad sounds like an idiot. Secondly, I think it makes you more of a man admitting that you need help. Last of all, I sincerely hope you are able to sort out a way to get therapy as it sounds like you would really benefit from it. You cannot choose not be anxious. That is ridiculous. You are amazingly strong for reaching out for help.

Your dad is full of shit for everyone. Anxiety is different, and in some cases, you need help. I cannot give you advice on your relationship to your dad, but know that just because he is loud and your father does not mean he is right.

He also has anxiety and it destroyed his life but he is projecting onto me after I confusion developed a panic disorder last year when he found out how bad it actually was I thought he would be nice but he yelled at me and said some horrible things that honestly might put me into a depression for a while he said anxiety is a choice and that since my brain is like plastic, I can choose not to be anxious. And he said I am going to be a failure in life if I keep having panic attacks and he even said he will shove as many triggers in my face whenever possible so I can get the fuck over it. He also told he I wish someone beat the shit out of you right now. Maybe that would teach you a lesson on manliness. He also said, I am a disgrace to anyone who went through any actual ptsd trauma like marines or veterans. I told him he is verbally abusing me, and he said, im telling you this because I love you and want to see you succeed in life. The real world is rougher than I am, and I am trying to prepare you for it. And if this is abusive, then I guess every military sargent out there is an abuser ha see you cannot refute that you loose. Can I please have some support? The worst part is I need therapy and I cannot afford it unless he helps meWith insurance stuff. But I overheard my mom telling him this and he said, is it really that bad? She said, yes. And he said, well, I got to be fucking harder on him then before thats all I heard edit. Oh great. Now he is having a panic attack and wants everyone to treat him with special care and take his anxiety seriously.

Unfortunately people equate having anxiety to not being man enough it the same in my family dad sometimes makes offhand comments even though he too has anxiety he just chooses to bottle it in and occasionally deals with it through anger it never gotten as bad as threatening anyone though I would recommend moving out if that is at all possible since putting up with your dad is not good for you although I do not think his heart or actions are in the right place he is kind of right your brain is still developing so right now is the ideal time to tackle your anxiety since it only gets harder, the older and more set in your ways you are some psychologists offer their services on a sliding scale you re so I think you qualify based on what you not your parents make you could also try medication first your go can prescribe some conservative first line treatments ie not benzos or sri confusion if you want to go that route

He doing what he thinks will work. You can choose to appreciate that in some way while still disagreeing with his methods. The best way to handle this would be to take what he says with humor and just laugh at him and call him abusive. If that is what you feel, he does not mean any harm. And if you take it with humor, you defuse him and may actually make him stop in some things. He may also be right. Anxiety makes you a say, as you are not going to go after things with the effort you would have if you did not have anxiety, that just a fact. And you should not take that as criticism as it is not about you personally but about any man or person with anxiety. It will limit you. So this is just knowledge you should use to put in a bigger effort to work on improving your condition. Don look at him as abusive. Look at him as having kind of a panic attack himself over the situation and try to get him over it and to support you. If you show some confidence and give him both a bit of right and wrong, you may make him understand he does not know it all.

Title: Does anyone else prefer their depression to their anxiety?
Thread
I go through a cycle of different forms of depression and anxiety. I have severe anxiety about the outside world, which turns into severe internal anxiety about myself and my situation. And then it turns into a deep, dark depression, which then becomes an introverted depression. I shut down. I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the introverted depression it like I have given up. And I do not even care if I die anymore, whereas the anxiety makes me want to die it a damn horrible situation, no matter what. But the anxiety is like, agonising electricity passing through me constantly heightened emotions and constant threat and fear, like I cannot switch off, whereas the dark depression is a welcome relief from it. Unfortunately, its rare that I get into the introverted depression state it usually bypassed, and my usual dark depression goes straight back into external, then internal anxiety. But that fleeting moment of giving up and not caring if I live or die, or what happens to me anymore, is almost blissful. It only comes around when I have managed to shut myself away and hide from the world for a long time, though, and that does not happen as often as I would like

Definitely a little melancholy can even be quite pleasant in self indulgent sort of way. And there are things you can do to feel better if you are mildly depressed. Listen to music, read a good book! Eat more pudding! Anxiety, though, is just unmanageable. Once it starts, it feels disgusting to be alive, and any action you take to help makes it worse. Often, I do not like it when my mood lifts because it means the anxiety will be kicking in again very soon. Anxiety is possibly the most unpleasant feeling one can experience. Supposedly even quite severe physical pain becomes tolerable if you can remove the accompanying anxiety

Youd be surprised who you end up inspiring and befriending at the gym. Most people are there to listen to music and get a quick workout in. And the gym rats are used to seeing lots of different people at all hours of the day. Most personal trainers clients are overweight. Trying to get healthier, youre not going to break the treadmill. Start with a warm up walk and progress by increase speed, incline, or walking without holding on with your hands for balance. Take it easy and start slow. Let yourself get used to even just showing up if you just want to go in to stretch. That is okay, too.

I was scared to go to the gym to when I signed up, they gave me a tour. In the beginning, I would just go right to the treadmill. I did not want to mess with equipment. I did not know how to use. But a month or so later, my brother joined, and when he went, I would use other equipment with him. The more I went, the better I felt, the people at the desk knew me and would say, hi, I definitely think you should set up some personal training sessions. That way you can get familiar with equipment and excercises. Those pal are there to help pal reach their goals. And not everyone who hires a personal trainer is in good shape. I always hid on the treadmill be. I didnt want to be seen, but it became a habit to go, and I eventually felt I belonged there. Nobody cared what I was doing when I was there. They were busy doing their things. I started to really push myself to use other equipment. Im so glad I did. Everybody has got to start somewhere. You can do it, make a change

I like planet fitness. They do not allow intimidation practices. Many other gyms do example. There is no grunting allowed for those guys that like to lift weights and moan, any groan to get attention. I have seen people there easily your size and did not give it a single thought also did not see anyone else looking at and certainly not taking pictures of those who were perhaps a bit more overweight. Then others go for it. Theres so many health and self esteem benefits of losing weight that is making you feel self conscious right now. Besides, you go to the gym for you, not anybody else. Bring in some earbuds to listen to your favorite music while working out and just let everyone else disappear. Gym time should be something that makes you feel better about yourself and a time to try to relieve some stress. Do it, I believe in you, is if you need help finding your way around, then a person train could be very beneficial for you, and you can have them set up a routine to get you started with and go over how to use the machines and proper techniques on them.

When I see overweight people at the gym or running outside and struggling, I think to myself, hell yes, this person is taking control of their life, doing their thing and must have dug deep for that motivation. But there it is shining out. And then my day is made, and I am proud of these strangers. You never know what people are thinking to themselves pleading, face, heart suit.

I feel your pain. I also get like this I think it is a feeling of not having control anymore like I am in my own home, but the visitors will not leave. And so I feel a bit trapped in the situation. I literally have relatives who will just randomly show up at am with their kids for a swim, and I just want to be laying in bed relaxing. But because I feel I cannot tell them to leave, I am just stuck waiting for them to leave. Its so stressful in the past I would literally get so sick from holding in my anxiousness that I would end up vomiting these days. I try to be more assertive and just say to my husband, im feeling a bit wobbly so I am going to bed and that is what I do. I just leave and put my earphones in and listen to some meditations. Have to recognise what your limits are. Accept yourself for feeling that way and let everyone else know that is just how it is, and it is not up to you to tolerate their unwelcome visits.

Do you have medication for times like this? If not, maybe ask your doctor what you might be able to do in the future for now maybe try some white noise like a fan or some soft music in the future. Maybe keep a little kit with some comforting snacks, a magazine, some rescue remedy and other things that might bring you comfort. I hope they leave soon so you can relax.

I immediately flush and panic when I think about going back in to work, I have just been put on sertraline for intrusive thoughts and am now worried I will not be able to work due to the reaction I am having to the thought of going in. I need my wages more than anything, so I am even more panicked.

I was on that for a while and it does start to work. It helped me take the edge off. So if I was not on it, my anxiety would shoot to about an right away and I would have to talk myself down on it would only jump to maybe. And it was easier to talk myself down. Is it just when you are at work? Does it go away after a while just when in meetings with people?

Title: Unaware of thoughts anxiety.

I feel like there are times where I am actively being anxious about something, and that is when I can try to calm down. But then most of the time, I am not even aware of my thoughts. It is almost like these thoughts are in the back of my head. As I go on with my day, I only actually realise it when I am doing something. And once I am done, I realise I completely messed it up because I was not paying attention or that I start having physical symptoms. And then I notice, does anyone else feel like they are unaware of their thoughts? And what can I do to recognize them?

Title: Does anyone else prefer their depression to their anxiety?
Thread
I go through a cycle of different forms of depression and anxiety. I have severe anxiety about the outside world, which turns into severe internal anxiety about myself and my situation. And then it turns into a deep, dark depression, which then becomes an introverted depression. I shut down. I have come to the conclusion that I prefer the introverted depression it like I have given up. And I do not even care if I die anymore, whereas the anxiety makes me want to die it a damn horrible situation, no matter what. But the anxiety is like, agonising electricity passing through me constantly heightened emotions and constant threat and fear, like I cannot switch off, whereas the dark depression is a welcome relief from it. Unfortunately, its rare that I get into the introverted depression state it usually bypassed, and my usual dark depression goes straight back into external, then internal anxiety. But that fleeting moment of giving up and not caring if I live or die, or what happens to me anymore, is almost blissful. It only comes around when I have managed to shut myself away and hide from the world for a long time, though, and that does not happen as often as I would like

Not depression, but I highly prefer panic attacks to anxiety. Panic attacks come and go, they suck, but they are not constant. Once my anxiety is high, it is going to stay high and give me physical and mental issues. I was getting a tight chest and it just would not go away. So I finally started lexapro two weeks ago. It horrible. I wish I had panic attacks and not anxiety.

Unfortunately, its rare that I get into the introverted depression state it usually bypassed, and my usual dark depression goes straight back into external, then internal anxiety. But that fleeting moment of giving up and not caring if I live or die, or what happens to me anymore, is almost blissful.

I totally feel this. It was not until a couple months ago my anxiety went haywire and completely fucked me up physically and mentally for me, it is been completely different than depression. When I was depressed, I at least still felt like my normal self and could function properly without a care in the world. Now I am the complete opposite and I fuckin hate it would rather be depressed.

I was pretty depressed yesterday, I was not irritable or grouchy with my wife and kids, just fatigued and sad. All I wanted to do was take my meds and go to sleep. So I got a solid night sleep and have a lot of energy today, which scares me because I have nothing going on, and I am done going out for the day. All it will take is a couple intrusive thoughts out of left field to turn me into an anxious, restless mess, and then I will be stuck there until I go to sleep. I am not going to allow myself to have anxiety about the chance. I might have anxiety, though. So I am hoping for a relaxing day. This may be a weird symptom of anxiety, depression, but I prefer when it is not sunny outside. And today, a perfect cold, snowy gray day

I am no mental health care professional, but I do believe unaddressed depression, in many cases, is what can lead to some of the worst anxiety.

Definitely a little melancholy can even be quite pleasant in self indulgent sort of way. And there are things you can do to feel better if you are mildly depressed. Listen to music, read a good book! Eat more pudding! Anxiety, though, is just unmanageable. Once it starts, it feels disgusting to be alive, and any action you take to help makes it worse. Often, I do not like it when my mood lifts because it means the anxiety will be kicking in again very soon. Anxiety is possibly the most unpleasant feeling one can experience. Supposedly even quite severe physical pain becomes tolerable if you can remove the accompanying anxiety

Not depression, but I highly prefer panic attacks to anxiety. Panic attacks come and go, they suck, but they are not constant. Once my anxiety is high, it is going to stay high and give me physical and mental issues. I was getting a tight chest and it just would not go away. So I finally started lexapro two weeks ago. It horrible. I wish I had panic attacks and not anxiety.

I have been through the big sad many times but anxiety is a constant feeling of shutting out and down in uncomfortable situations, even if it is small. Yes, I prefer the big sad.

He also has anxiety and it destroyed his life but he is projecting onto me after I confusion developed a panic disorder last year when he found out how bad it actually was I thought he would be nice but he yelled at me and said some horrible things that honestly might put me into a depression for a while he said anxiety is a choice and that since my brain is like plastic, I can choose not to be anxious. And he said I am going to be a failure in life if I keep having panic attacks and he even said he will shove as many triggers in my face whenever possible so I can get the fuck over it. He also told he I wish someone beat the shit out of you right now. Maybe that would teach you a lesson on manliness. He also said, I am a disgrace to anyone who went through any actual ptsd trauma like marines or veterans. I told him he is verbally abusing me, and he said, im telling you this because I love you and want to see you succeed in life. The real world is rougher than I am, and I am trying to prepare you for it. And if this is abusive, then I guess every military sargent out there is an abuser ha see you cannot refute that you loose. Can I please have some support? The worst part is I need therapy and I cannot afford it unless he helps meWith insurance stuff. But I overheard my mom telling him this and he said, is it really that bad? She said, yes. And he said, well, I got to be fucking harder on him then before thats all I heard edit. Oh great. Now he is having a panic attack and wants everyone to treat him with special care and take his anxiety seriously.

Tell your dad to go fuck himself. Anyone who thinks only leos and ex military can develop ptsd clearly has an iq below room temperature and should not speak further on the subject. He very obviously has no understanding of how difficult anxiety and ptsd can make just existing some days.

Can you leave the house? I found that my mental health improved the less time I spent at home. You do not need to sit there and listen to him. You re very astute in having recognized that he is projecting hard on you. The next step is creating boundaries, walk away, change the topic, or grey rock him whenever he starts on the subject, he will need to vent his frustrations to someone else. And can I just say, if anything, you are much more of a man if you can recognize anxiety and other emotions in yourself and realize that faking it is not the way out. Emotional intelligence is supremely attractive in any person, man or woman,

Your dad is a pos man. I am sorry if it is possible. Try to move in with family or relatives until you can find something of your own. What he is doing is literally the last thing you need exposure to. On the other side of that coin, it is sad that all of these older boys from gen and older were taught to bottle things up talking makes a man weak. All this macho horseshit. I hope he gets the help he needs. But as a parent myself, I always want better for my own babies than what I had he hurting not helping

Your dad is ignorant. Af especially if he had extreme anxiety. Sorry, you are going through this. Panic disorder is crippling, but it is something you can fight. And sometimes without medication, if you make some important lifestyle and diet changes, you do not have to be fat, to be unhealthy, fuel you body better, and your mind will also feel the benefitsconfusion. What helped me a lot was reading books on anxiety and panic. Know you are not alone. Know how your body works and why it reacts the way it does. Knowing really is half the battle. Good luck to you, and do not forget there are anxiety support phone lines you can call

And he said I am going to be a failure in life if I keep having panic attacks and he even said he will shove as many triggers in my face whenever possible so I can get the fuck over it. He also told he I wish someone beat the shit out of you right now. Maybe that would teach you a lesson on manliness. He also said, I am a disgrace to anyone who went through any actual ptsd trauma like marines or veterans. I told him he is verbally abusing me, and he said, im telling you this because I love you and want to see you succeed in life. The real world is rougher than I am, and I am trying to prepare you for it. And if this is abusive, then I guess every military sargent out there is an abuser ha see you cannot refute that you loose. Can I please have some support? The worst part is I need therapy and I cannot afford it unless he helps meWith insurance stuff. But I overheard my mom telling him this and he said, is it really that bad? She said, yes. And he said, well, I got to be fucking harder on him then before thats all I heard edit. Oh great. Now he is having a panic attack and wants everyone to treat him with special care and take his anxiety seriously.

Just in case you need a normal meter for perspective. The way he is treating you is not normal, acceptable or healthy. You deserve better from him. Family is supposed to be a shelter from the cruelty of the world. And right now, he personally sounds worse than what the world is going to throw at you.

Tactic tell your mother she needs to either make your dad stop or get you away from him or he might drive you to hurt yourself this is abuse tactic ask your dad to help you pay for martial arts lessons so you can get tougher find a teacher that also believes in meditation and centering and stuff this will possibly help your anxiety but most importantly it means you will eventually be able to out fight your dad so you can freely tell him to fuck right off and he will not be able to do shit about it

Your dad is also struggling. That is why he is saying those terrible things. It is hard to hear these statements from our parents, as society teaches us to look to them for comfort, take care of yourself and get medical care from a physician, our counselor, you path to a healthier life can be found.

I think you already know this, and I am going to say it anyway. You are no less of a man, no less of a human being for having a panic disorder. It a very human experience. You are worthy, as you are from this encounter. It sounds like confronting your dad leads to stressful situations. You may need to change your behavior around him to protect yourself. It was really brave of you to call him out, though it sounds like it escalated threats from him. He not able to be a caregiver for you right now. And that suckswink or smirk. So see what you can do to work with your mom. I am really sorry that you are going through this the next few months may be rough, so please be gentle with yourself. I believe you have what you need to find healing. Be kind and be patient

My grandparents were the same way to my little sister she is almost. She told them she was depressed and suicidal. They did not believe her. She sought out a counselor and told them she was suicidal in front of our grandparents. It took them hearing it from a counselor saying, yes, she is depressed. She needs meds or therapy and she is suicidal to actually wake the hell up and realize mental health is real and needs to be taken seriously or they could actually lose. They are granddaughter, im sorry you are going through this. My messages are always open

I am glad that you recognize it as abuse. I know it can be rough, but try to focus less on what he says. Since it seems most of what he will say has little good intention or awareness of its harm. If you cannot access therapy, find friends or support groups to talk about your experiences, also consider meditation, so it will be easier to withstand any is and violation of trust that comes your way.

Can you leave the house? I found that my mental health improved the less time I spent at home. You do not need to sit there and listen to him. You re very astute in having recognized that he is projecting hard on you. The next step is creating boundaries, walk away, change the topic, or grey rock him whenever he starts on the subject, he will need to vent his frustrations to someone else. And can I just say, if anything, you are much more of a man if you can recognize anxiety and other emotions in yourself and realize that faking it is not the way out. Emotional intelligence is supremely attractive in any person, man or woman,

My grandfather has said this exact stuff to all the men in my family. Having anxiety does not make you any less of a man, and I am so sorry your father is verbally abusing you. I cannot even imagine how this makes your anxiety even worse. You are not a disgrace dude. I have suffered anxiety my entire life and our brains and nervous system handle things differently from people who do not have anxiety. My doctor has even told me this I have autism and severe anxiety, and I spent years trying to get rid of my anxiety, but it is here to stay. I can only learn how to make accommodations for myself. I hope there is someone you can talk to

I am sorry about your dad. He sounds like he is terrified and lashing out at anything that might encourage him to take a hard look at himself. My dad can be the same in some ways, but my diagnosis was much later in life. So my situation was very different. I will say this though you are managing to wake up and do battle with invisible predators every single day and every day, you wake up and resolve to fight back is literally a victory for you. Remember that you fight monsters? What your father says does not matter. I am proud of you for fighting. Oh, and about the whole disgracing soldiers thing. I actually asked a marine friend of mine who has ptsd, he sends his best wishes to you and had a lot of enthusiastic things to say about how full of crap your dad is about this

Like you said, he is projecting onto you. I also dealt with a verbally abusive father I would create a dream and plan to create some space for yourself in the future. I know it is difficult in the moment, but your father also has some unresolved trauma from earlier in his life.

He doing what he thinks will work. You can choose to appreciate that in some way while still disagreeing with his methods. The best way to handle this would be to take what he says with humor and just laugh at him and call him abusive. If that is what you feel, he does not mean any harm. And if you take it with humor, you defuse him and may actually make him stop in some things. He may also be right. Anxiety makes you a say, as you are not going to go after things with the effort you would have if you did not have anxiety, that just a fact. And you should not take that as criticism as it is not about you personally but about any man or person with anxiety. It will limit you. So this is just knowledge you should use to put in a bigger effort to work on improving your condition. Don look at him as abusive. Look at him as having kind of a panic attack himself over the situation and try to get him over it and to support you. If you show some confidence and give him both a bit of right and wrong, you may make him understand he does not know it all.

First of all I am sorry that he is treating you that way it is not easy to have a loved one beat you down when you are having some mental health problems secondly there is no measure of manliness that you have to live up to hiding how you feel or just acting like things do not bother you does not make you tough men have feelings just like every other human does there also is not an olympics for anxiety and trauma your anxiety and mental health issues are no less real than a soldier who served in afghanistan it takes courage and strength to admit you have issues suppressing your feelings may work in the short term but it can make you bitter and closed off from the world, making it harder to connect to people you do not have to do things alone you can talk through things with people. The world is a tough place, but it is much harder alone than it is together and you are not alone

Title: I want to start going to the gym, but I am too scared to go and I do not know what to.
Thread
I am like pounds. Yes, unfortunatelyconfusion, I have been fat all of my life, and I am sick of it. I lost pounds a couple years, but I gained back. I want to go a gym, but I am scared of being judged. I am picturing myself walking in, and these people looking at me like, holy fuck, that motherfucker is huge! Holy shit! They would probably take pictures of me and shit, too. I would like to go with someone, but I do not have any friends to go with. I was thinking about getting a personal trainer, but they would probably be absolutely disgusted about having to work with me. They would probably up and quit their job. I mean, what if I get on like a treadmill or something and I break the damn thing

I like planet fitness. They do not allow intimidation practices. Many other gyms do example. There is no grunting allowed for those guys that like to lift weights and moan, any groan to get attention. I have seen people there easily your size and did not give it a single thought also did not see anyone else looking at and certainly not taking pictures of those who were perhaps a bit more overweight. Then others go for it. Theres so many health and self esteem benefits of losing weight that is making you feel self conscious right now. Besides, you go to the gym for you, not anybody else. Bring in some earbuds to listen to your favorite music while working out and just let everyone else disappear. Gym time should be something that makes you feel better about yourself and a time to try to relieve some stress. Do it, I believe in you, is if you need help finding your way around, then a person train could be very beneficial for you, and you can have them set up a routine to get you started with and go over how to use the machines and proper techniques on them.

I am sorry about your dad. He sounds like he is terrified and lashing out at anything that might encourage him to take a hard look at himself. My dad can be the same in some ways, but my diagnosis was much later in life. So my situation was very different. I will say this though you are managing to wake up and do battle with invisible predators every single day and every day, you wake up and resolve to fight back is literally a victory for you. Remember that you fight monsters? What your father says does not matter. I am proud of you for fighting. Oh, and about the whole disgracing soldiers thing. I actually asked a marine friend of mine who has ptsd, he sends his best wishes to you and had a lot of enthusiastic things to say about how full of crap your dad is about this

You definitely got it hands down with your dad projecting if it is destroyed his life, he is doing what he thinks he has to do so you would not be like him or in a worse outcome. He is projecting his own self hatred onto you at least when you look at it the way that it is you can detach yourself from it because it is not about you or your condition as a man, but it is to do with him. You know that your disorder is valid you know that it is not just something to get over. Its not easy, but if you see his behaviors for what they are, it will not hurt as much because it truly is not about you are more educated and science does not lie. Being yelled at is not healthy for anyone, though. So as soon as you can, you should probably distance yourself from him, and the situation cheers.

My confusion. Parents generations are the type to deny that mental health concerns even exist. They are so busy ignoring is existence that they say things like that. Judy, she is just a bit weird, or they go out of their way to never talk about uncle jim, because it is too painful to talk about his cancer. Uh, he topped himself my dude. And he was too afraid to seek help, because no one fucking believed him that depression is a thing you failed himconfusion. Your dad sounds like he fits the mold. Ignorance on his behalf should not mean acceptance on yours. If my old man called me a pussy for having anxieties, I would do birthdays and christmases, and that is, it only give them as much as they deserve. Edit, autocorrect,

Hey, don listen to him. It not a choice. It is a constant fight that is uphill. I did not have a situation like yours, but I did those things your dad did to you to myself it has nothing to do with strength or manliness. Fuck, um, all I hope you get the support you need use, self reflection and other resilience tools to help you manage for now ill do some resources if you want. I ended up managing everything for awhile, but it was just managing after about years I cracked the longer you leave it. The worse it is. I have meds to help now and I am solid, still use coping techniques and other things as meds only help so much seen the update also. So is he going to help you with the insurance now

My confusion. Parents generations are the type to deny that mental health concerns even exist. They are so busy ignoring is existence that they say things like that. Judy, she is just a bit weird, or they go out of their way to never talk about uncle jim, because it is too painful to talk about his cancer. Uh, he topped himself my dude. And he was too afraid to seek help, because no one fucking believed him that depression is a thing you failed. Himconfusion. Your dad sounds like he did the mold. Ignorance on his behalf should not mean acceptance on yours if my old man called me a pussy for having anxieties, if so birthdays and christmases, and that is, it only give them as much as they deserve.

Anxiety is horrible. And I know first hand what you are going through, but you need to forget about what he said and work on things yourselfscrew him right now. He has his own issues to fight. He is right in some ways, in the fact that you need to stop complaining and take control of your life, thats a must, putting in the work, research, therapy, medication, etc. Confusion. And owning this issue is what real men do. You got this?

Like you said, he is projecting onto you. I also dealt with a verbally abusive father I would create a dream and plan to create some space for yourself in the future. I know it is difficult in the moment, but your father also has some unresolved trauma from earlier in his life.

I suffer from panic attacks as well. I cannot be more than minutes away from a hospital or I will get a panic attack getting stuck in traffic is also a trigger and when I first started getting panic attacks, I could not leave my house for the first year. I still suffer from anxiety. However I am a father now of two kids the bread winner of my family take care of my family and have a roof over my wife and kids yet you ask ne to fly or drive out to the lake I will have a panic attack. Does that make me less than a man? No being a man has nothing do to with anxiety or how you hide your emotions. Your dad is a asshole.

Your father is a little bitch who got brainwashed by his other bitch father. Instead of improving this horrible lifecycle, he chooses to continue that shit and do it to you. My dad is narcissistic piece of human trash. He manipulated me my whole life and treated me very bad. Just remember when he is old and gets sick and all that stuff, then you will be the one to call him a pussy. Wake up, man, dont let yourself treat like that. Be greater than him. And if one day you get a kid make sure to be a proper dad and do the opposite life decision that your father took

I have been in a damn near similar situation. Funny thing is, I could not take his shit one night, and I ended up popping him in the face at years old and we never spoke again. This turned out to be great, as I believe old dogs cannot learn new tricks your dads likely going to not change on a positive note, and it will sound so annoying to here. Keeping busy eating healthy and working out will naturally make you feel better, which only helps time will heal. Sorry for your situation. I have also read a lot of positive books which temporarily helps, but as time passes, it will become you

Being beaten up does not make you a man. It has caused me some mental issues beyond anxiety, so I would not wish that on others. He sounds dangerous to listen to or to be around if he is saying that kind of shit to you. Anxiety is not dealt with by extreme measures. It takes a lot of care and time to get yourself in a better place.

Laughing out loud I am a white woman who has never been in a fight and the guy who diagnosed me with severe ptsd was a nuclear engineer in the navy has testified in front of congress and used to run a large ptsd clinic for vets you not being in the military does not mean you are shitting on those who have combat ptsd and tell your dad that he is the reason you have panic disorder was your dad in the military by chance my dad was army he brought work home with him a lot any time I looked remotely unhappy with how he punished me he would tell me a story about how he had it worse if as a child I struggled to do a chore, he would yell at me that I was lazy because he did it in the army. You trying to treat yourself compassionately is way more manly than he will ever be just because he uses you as a punching bag does not mean that he has magically overcome his anxiety

My grandfather has said this exact stuff to all the men in my family. Having anxiety does not make you any less of a man, and I am so sorry your father is verbally abusing you. I cannot even imagine how this makes your anxiety even worse. You are not a disgrace dude. I have suffered anxiety my entire life and our brains and nervous system handle things differently from people who do not have anxiety. My doctor has even told me this I have autism and severe anxiety, and I spent years trying to get rid of my anxiety, but it is here to stay. I can only learn how to make accommodations for myself. I hope there is someone you can talk to

Seriously, anxiety, making everyday life a living, hell, intrusive thoughts, constant fear, panic attacks, disassociation, constantly worrying, overthinking every little thing until it drives you insane. I hate anxiety. I wish it would go away. I wish I could live a life free of anxiety and depression. The people who do not suffer with mental health do not have any idea how lucky they are.

I was talking to my mom about it earlier, I said, wherever I go, its like im in a space suit, and im afraid to take my helmet off. Thats what its like. No matter where you are, you cant really feel anything or be in the moment because youre in your spacesuit like there isnt air to breathe out there. And its not safe, and you cant relax until you get back to your spaceship where theres an air bubble. Like, everywhere you go, you have to wear your space suit. Its hard to hear people through the thick glass on your helmet, and they have a hard time hearing you, too. You cant even really hug anyone or hold hands because the suit is super thick and uncomfortable, and you cant really participate in anything. You just have to watch. The suits too heavy to run around in like everyone else is just out there, and they can go wherever they want. Theyare free. They dont need a space suit, but not you. Its not for you out there. Its too dangerous for you have to stay in the safety of your spacesuit and wait at home in your spaceship. Wait for the day that you finally get the courage to go out there. Close your eyes and take your helmet off to see what its like to breathe real air for the first time to see if you dont need the space suit anymore, but not today. Youll be safe in your spaceSuit youll stay behind the sealed door of your spaceship maybe tomorrow youll take off your helmet but not really its way too dangerous

I feel like people see my insecurities thus view me what I have to say. My opinions and my presence as insignificant. It feels like my shoulders are tired all the time from some invisible weight that is constantly on them. My body gets hot, I get heat flashes and I shake. My voice shakes. My body shakes. No matter how many times I consciously tell myself I am overthinking, overreacting, overanalyzing, irrational, subconscious thoughts and feelings overpower any attempt of calming myself down. When I speak, I feel like I am being judged like people see everything wrong with me, like they see past the walls I have put up to try to hide my fear and insecurities. And because I assume they see me for me, I feel insignificant, like I do not deserve praise or respect. My insecurities make me feel meaningless. They make me feel unimportant. And if people see through the tough exterior I attempt to uphold, they see that I feel this way, which will reaffirm my irrationality or so, I believe I feel like people see through me, maybe because I see through other people, maybe because I have this belief that doing something wrong, not being perfect, looking, embarrassed, acting embarrassed, getting something wrong is punishable and dreadful. My parents made it seem like the end of the world when I made small mistakes or wrongdoings throughout my life, and I certainly was not complimented or praised enough. As a kid, they placed the most emphasis on myWrongdoings rather than my right doings, and because the bad, punishable things I did as a child or even throughout my teenage years, were punished to the point where I felt scared for my emotional, mental and physical well, being I have grown to judge and hold the world around me to those same standards. If you do something wrong, it is god awful. And when you do something right, it does not matter. It goes overlooked, because what you did wrong overrides what you did. Well definitely sounds like the effects of their parenting style to me. Lolconfusion. The fact that I myself am a perfectionist does not help, nor does the introverted, shy nature I have always known to have. According to my philosophy, people can only view and judge you on the same level that they view and judge themselves. Perfectionists are on the lookout for flaws within themselves and others, much like when you are sad, you are aware of and more sensitive to everything that makes you sad. Whereas when you are happy, you notice the tiny things that make you happy, which you, of course, would not notice if you were in a different state of mind confusion. Everything you see externally is a reflection of how you feel internally. Maybe I give people too much credit. Maybe they are not all as observant as I am or maybe they do not overthink as I do, regardless of how I try to convince myself that I am overthinking everything theAnxiety that I experience is irrational and immune to rationality. This was my best attempt at explaining how it feels to have an anxiety disorder. It was something I wrote on google docs a few months ago. I know how you feel confusion.

Title: Anxiety is a demon.
Thread
Seriously, anxiety, making everyday life a living, hell, intrusive thoughts, constant fear, panic attacks, disassociation, constantly worrying, overthinking every little thing until it drives you insane. I hate anxiety. I wish it would go away. I wish I could live a life free of anxiety and depression. The people who do not suffer with mental health do not have any idea how lucky they are.

Title: Hyperthyearoidism anxiety questions rant
Thread
I have posted a handful of times on here and really just looking for some help. I have been out of work due to the pandemic for a while, and needless to say, I am not doing great financially. Now, I do not know how I am going to be able to hold down a job feeling the way I do again. I was doing so good for so long, and now I am back in the same pit of misery I used to be in constantly. From may to october, I was doing great little to no anxiety whatsoever. Randomly in november, however, that all changed. I started to feel how I would used to feel. It was not as bad as it is been the last couple of days, but it still was hard to function from december to this past saturday, february thconfusion. I was feeling back to myself and it was going great. Then randomly on sunday, the I woke up feeling extremely dizzy, lightheaded, and needless to say, it was terrifying. I do not know why these symptoms have appeared quite honestly out of nowhere. I get that is part of this disease, but it does not make it any easier. I just need support. I am just trying to get back how I was feeling before this past sunday. I have also had a constant ringing in my ears as well, but I do not know if that is related any and all help and tips would be extremely appreciated.I have been taking my meds with minimal missed days for coming up on years now, and I have barely seen any relief. My hyperthyearoidism is not caused by any autoimmune disease either, and I did not have any goiters when it was first checked in. I just do not understand why I have not started to go into remission yet. Its just been getting to me, and I felt the need to rant.
Comments
No joke. I have had those symptoms pop up randomly as well, just fatigued light headed with a slight head ache. I freaked out for a bit, but those are symptoms of anxiety. They have eased up, but its a constant battle against your brain.

Ever since my first couple of anxiety attacks, my feet have been sweating whenever I out a blanket over them. Then when I feel my feet there, cold. Sometimes my lyphnodes will just be swollen for no reason there, not hard or anything, but still scary. And I get slight itches in my armpit sometimes and itches in my lower shin. I just need some support or any kind words to get me through this phase of fear.

I get itchy when anxious sometimes so I think it is common also I can feel a lot of my lymphnodes but I had blood work done and other things checked out and they all seemed normal. Anxiety can cause a lot of physical symptoms I know I freak myself out sometimes always assuming the worst when it comes to my health best thing to do is check in with a doctor to be sure.

Hello in. I totally freaked out about my lymph nodes never in life had I felt them, and I did not even know they exist. I touched and found one in my leg, and I totally panicked. I thought I had something cancer or what not I let it pass, but I kept feeling it later. I found more, and then even more, and I thought I was terminal. I found out that they are part of are part of the body and have a function. But I kept reading and found a lot of illnesses related to lymph nodes. So I honestly thought I was dying. I eventually went to get them checked and everything checked out. Right? I came to realization how easy our mind tricks us into nightmares everyday. For those couple of months, I honestly thought I didnt have time. It turns out they are normal now I feel them frequently, and I have even found more in my armpits and neck. I was also paranoid about having itched in my armpit. But that is normal could be the deodorant could be the sweat. I am no doctor. But if nothing is hurting or massively growing, you are okay. Go get them checked, and you will see everything is fine. You will get the reassurance you need, and it will make you feel better

I stopped drinking over a year ago because of the anxiety and yes, alcohol definitely makes it worse. I would recommend reading this naked mind. It has some really good points about booze, and it is effect on you. I really think you should see someone, too, though, because just stopping drinking may not be all you need to deal with. I wish you all the best edited because I realized I used affect effect incorrectly, and I cannot have that red heart.

Its would be a good thing to stop I do not know how much you drink so be careful if you do stop cold turkey as alcohol withdrawal can be dangerous but get help to stop if you can stop for a month and you will feel better now anxiety will get worse when you stop for a while at least and bad things from your past you have been avoiding will come back to haunt you but that is actually a good thing as it is the only way to work through your demons I would also advise you to start exercising I you dontconfusion nothing crazy at first just get the blood flowing and walks in nature if possible youl feel way better quickly and walking gives you an opportunity to think and sort out stuff I you can go see a psychotherapist that specializes in cut cognitive behavioral therapyconfusion they help you identify and breakdown what triggers your anxiety in order to work through it. Its a hard battle. Il tell you I personally just came out of a year of severe depression and anxiety, but I did the work and my life is amazing now its hard, but worth it youl find you are way more courageous than you think. When you start fighting your fears, I wish you luck. Peace

Jogging lightlyconfusion helps a lot with my anxiety. At the end of the day, I have less energy available to get a panick attack. Since I have used it exercising therapy there, you will not find miracles or even a cure, probably. But having someone to express your most shameful aspects, etc. Is for some reason relieving.

After years of failing and postponing my goals, I finally quit. So I would suggest you keep trying and failing. Meanwhile, you at least drink less, I think, hope you get better

Drinking due to stress is a slippery slope. It becomes a nightmare. Out of nowhere, I got to the point of being chemically dependent. Drinking was maintenance to get rid of withdrawal, and it was not enjoyable. The constant feeling of your body needing alcohol is fucking terrible. It only makes mental health issues worse, especially if on medications over the years, I have done irreparable damage to my body and mind and my relationships. I am not saying that this will happen to you, but it really is a dangerous way to cope. Do not do it.

If you suspect your drinking is problematic, it probable is you have gone through many tough life changes and trauma. It would be best to work with a professional to process this and learn healthy ways to cope. When my anxiety spiraled out of control, I would isolate, and my world shrank because I was scared and overwhelmed. Even basic tasks, like going to the grocery store were terrifying. I worked hard with my psychologist and psychiatrist to treat my anxiety. You do not need to figure everything out. Now, try to make small goals or tasks.

Trust me, you have got to stop sooner than later. I have been drinking for years and landed myself in the hospital recently with acute pancreatitis and an enlarged liver. It was definitely a wake up call, and probably the only thing that would have gotten me to wake up. Tbe I have been sober for over a week now. The withdrawal was awful, but it was worth it. I feel so much better already. I am terrified of relapsing, but that is not happening anytime soon as I am still dealing with those medical issues. And I really cannot afford more hospital debt as for being a nervous about doing simple things, excessive alcohol use causes huge anxiety. It got to the point where I would have to take a shot before I could go to the grocery store. I get it sorry, im rambling. I just really hope you can quit. Be careful, quitting cold turkey, do your researchconfusion, or even wean yourself off ink,

Definitely sounds like anxiety. Drinking makes anxiety worse. As a long time sufferer of anxiety, I used to think the party life was helping me, and I was severely depressed, anxious. Constantly, it was only when I fell pregnant, stopped drinking for months, and then drank occasionally. After that, I realised how bad it made me feel. I can now see that it affects me so badly for a few days, at least before I was drinking every weekend. So just topping up all the time and keeping myself in that constant state of depression anxiety, I feel so much better. Now, thats not to say, do not drink at all. Just pick and choose when it is worth it. I will now drink on my birthday christmas, and if I go to a gig, etc. But not every weekend, for no reason. If I do drink outside of that, it is at home and one or two max. If I am having a particularly anxious time, like nowconfusion, I will avoid drinking alcohol because I do not want to heighten my anxiety. I will drink again. When I feel in a better state of mind. Trust me, you will feel so much better. If you stop for a while and focus on getting better, you can do this. Op I highly recommend self guided meditations on youtube and reading stoic quotes. Also, every time you think of a negative counteract it with a positive, I do not think any of us will ever be curedOf this disorder, but we can definitely do a lot to minimise it. One huge game changer for me with interviews was getting a prescription of propranolol I went to do and told them I had tried a friends, and it was like a miracle drug. They had no problem prescribing me my to take as and when needed. If I am dreading something or having a particularly anxious day, I will take one at one point. I was taking them every day, but no longer feel that is needed. So very rarely take them. If you want to chat about anything, feel free to message me

I quit months ago and it is been tough I cannot imagine your pain but I can relate to how easy it is to get caught in this vicious cycle of anxiety, drinking, temporary relief the low down and it becomes a habit so quick then you keep doing it and it becomes reinforced and becomes a coping mechanism for me I just stopped one day I said, that is it I did some you tubing about how other people quit and the dangers of drinking and the effect on the dopamine reward system. I joined a gym class, just beginner yogaconfusion and started to fill the drinking time with other things, like meeting none drinkers working on a business idea reading, running just anything I could do. I started online therapy too. Maybe it is something easy to do. You could consider too, because it helped me alot sleep and exercise and food can be stressed. How much these are so important. Take care of your body, take care of your routine. You need things to do support, make it a challenge, a new start. I am sorry for what you have been through. But I suddenly remembered a quote in a book. I read, pain in inevitable in this life. But our suffering is optional. You have the power to turn this suffering into something else. Maybe you can join a beginner meditation class. Meet people, share your pain and let it out, work with people and make a plan anyway, some ideas thatHelped me and I hope they help you take care and warm wishes.

When I first started dealing with anxiety, my appetite would go away randomly while I was eating, I would be hungry. Then all of a sudden I am there worrying about life and existence. I had some depersonalization shit laughing out loud, confusion. I just did my best to say, fuck your feelings, and just continued to eat, even when I did not want to.

Hope she has a fast flight. Get it over with faster hang in there.

Title: I am so worried.
Thread
My mom flies back home today and planes scare me so much. I have never been on a plane myself because of this, but everyone in my family has flown numerous times, and every time they get on a plane, I am a nervous wreck. Until they land. I cannot even sleep.

Title: I had the police at my house for no reason.
Thread
I called the police because I thought I heard someone in my house full sweep and no one was there. I heard my screen door swinging, which is what woke me up. I thought, for sure, I heard my front door dead bolt being locked. I looked into my front room and my lamp was turned off when I would had it dimmed earlier before falling asleep. Thats the one thing I cannot explain. I do not know what happened there. Despite getting the clear, I am still locked in my bedroom. With all my animals. I have work in two hours, and I do not want to go still very shaken up.

Title: I am terrified to go to university orientation tomorrow.
Thread
Hi I am and I have major anxiety, especially when it comes to meeting new people. This week is my universities orientation week that first week everyone has fun, gets free stuff and meet a bunch of new people. Now I should of gone from monday, but I got couid last week and just tested negative, which mean, I can go tomorrow. Thursdayconfusion. Originally, I was meant to go with a bunch of friends who are going to the same university. Only problem is none of them are going tomorrow. I do not want to seem needy or like an inconvenience, even though they know I have anxietyconfusion. So I am not going to ask, but the thought of me going to an unfamiliar place knowing no one and being around new people is making me severely anxious. I am currently shaking and crying, writing this post, and it is taking everything out of me not break down into a panic attack. I just do not think I can do it. And I have previously had experiences where I have been alone in a new place, and I have had panic attacks so bad I black out I do not know what to do. I do not know how you can help, but all I want to scream is someone please help me. I am just thinking I might not go, even though I really want to amp update hi. So I ended up going with a primary school friends who I have not seen inA long time we had a great time. The two days I ended up going and got to meet her friends who were so nice and genuine just being able to rant and get a bit of advice was so amazing. Thank you. Hopefully I continue to feel good about meeting new people in coming weeks. Seeing as I made new friends instantly, I am hoping it all goes smoothly. Happy face or smiley.

Regardless of going alone by yourself or with friends, you are going to meet new people. Thats okay. There are others who will be just as anxious as you. Theyare probably thinking the exact things as you or if they are dressed properly, or if they look attractive or wonder if others are looking at them. I promise you, that is not the case. No one will be worried about your looks during orientation. They are all nervous soon to be college students just like yourself. I would say, go to this orientation. Even if you are alone, you do not have to talk to anyone. If someone does come up to you, let them engage the conversation, you do not have to say much, youll warm up to things but make sure you go. Its a fun experience. I got to college myself, except my college is a military one, and my orientation was being yelled at by leaders. Can you imagine how scary that is? Lol, here I am years later, about to graduate, I promise it gets better.

Title: Travel disruption and I end up completely frozen with anxiety.
Thread
My partner and I have flights to the usa on saturday you have to be fully vaccinated to fly we both are and it took me all of minutes to download my pass online but the uk couid pass system keeps rejected her proof of identity which means we cannot obtain proof of vaccination for her without this we cannot get on the flight the outcomes are either she gets her id verified in time and we travel as planned she cannot get her couid pass and we have to reschedule flights but this is the only time we can go so we would have to pick a random date later in the year and who knows if we can go then confusion she cannot get her couid pass and we cannot amend the flights so we lose our trip and our money in the meantime I am meant to be getting on with uni work and I just can I am a frozen mess of an anxious blob. Travel plans fill me with intense anxiety at the best of times and the flights themselves, even if we get them, stress me out because at the moment we are not sitting together for any of our flights which it is looking like we will not be getting anyway confusion.

Title: Night time anxiety.
Thread
This has been an issue for years. At this point, it gets better sometimes, but most of the time, I cannot sleep properly, I get a lot of anxiety at night, mostly about not waking up again. If I sleep or if I have had a good day, I will ruin it by thinking, the next day something terrible will happen. More recently, I have been getting random pains, which are probably normal in different areas, and I have been overthinking it too much. Yesterday, I made the mistake of searching up one of my symptoms on google, and as you can probably already tell, it, told me the worst case scenario, I could not sleep until early morning. I guess I am just tired of feeling so out of control. Does anyone know how to deal with night time anxiety? Are there any ways to rationalise these fears
Comments
First of all, let me tell you, are not alone. I have not had a proper night of sleep in weeks. I have had a headache for weeks checked online. Now I am convinced I have something in my brain despite a perfect it scanconfusion. What helps for me is staying active during the day sport, walking aroundconfusion do activities with friends to get my mind off thingsconfusion and talking about my problems with family friends. Basically not staying alone. Meditation and some teas can help too good luck. Smiling, face with open hands.

I do not get those exact symptoms, but I have had physical anxiety symptoms without consciously feeling anxious before. Also, my anxiety primarily manifests itself in physical sensations, which I find super distressing. And the only thing that helps them is antidepressants.

I used to have constant physical symptoms from anxiety, too, without even knowing that it was not normal. I finally found a psychiatrist that understood where my depression was coming from that constant anxiety. I was prescribed with effexor, then pristiq, and for the first time these symptoms were gone. Pristiq is better than effexor. For me, depression is now held in check, and anxiety is gone. I have lorazepam if needed, but I almost never use it these days. I hope you find relief. Op. Living with these symptoms can be a real pain, a living, hell, take care

Title: I have to get something off my chest I am still not over my year old ex girlfriend and it is causing major disruptions in my life.
Thread
Hello all I am a year old male currently attending college and much like the title suggests I have a horrible obsession distaste for my ex and unfortunately after going on many dates with other girls and going to bars social events, I am still having major problems finding other individuals to be considered as romantic partners and it has a lot to do with my ex let me explain a very long time ago myself and another individual who il call vee began to share and exchange incredibly intimate and sensitive topics on our minds that eventually lead to us forming a relationship. It lasted months but unfortunately died off due to vee losing interest and canceling on commitments that vee previously made. I was heartbroken to say none the least but willing to move on and attempt to meet other people to talk to and share feelings with. However, since we stopped officially seeing each other, I had continued to have text conversations and facetime with vee for over years recently, about yearsconfusion, I put my foot down and decided that this was not helping my in real life social life because I was saving a lot of my energy for vee when I should have been focusing on finding someone new. I also had ample opportunities to hook up with others, but I no longer feel that same spark I had with vee, which concerns me over years later and I still have not really had that close of a relationship with anyoneWhich for a short period of time lead me to drink excessively due to loneliness. But those days are behind me now the reason I am finally making this post and snapping like this is because a few hours ago from now I was headed to one of my dining halls that are located on my campus to grab a late snack as I had not eaten too much today. While at the hall I just so happened to be waiting in line for food when I glanced to the door and saw, you guessed it vee just talking with someone. My gut sank lower than it had ever before, and my hands got really shaken up. I tried to push it out of my mind, but it was no use. I ultimately lost my appetite and left prematurely. I genuinely felt like I was going to puke. And because of this experience, I was scared at how much something so stupid like my ex can cause me to shake to my core while I am perfectly ok with remaining calm and content in any other situation, im usually considered the most level headed with the people I hang out withconfusion. So moral of my point, I do not know what to do anymore, and I am tired of running and pretending that I am over her when I am unfortunately not. Its a shame that it is taken me this long to realize this fact, but I cannot deny that I have a problem nowAnd I feel backed into a corner and need help suggestions on what to do more than anything I would just appreciate the fact that someone might have read this as there is not many people in my social life who I trust to hear my rant twink or smirk she moved on but I have not been able to yet and would like to need

Ask your doctor for a prescription of propranolol my as needed for days up until the flight will help. Its a beta blocker so it will help block any physical symptoms of anxiety. Its often called the public speaking drug, since it blocks symptoms of anxiety to the point where you forget you are even anxious, then bring a book or a good to show on the flight, and you are set happy face or smiley.

Title: Antidepressants feeling worse before I feel better.

Hey guys. So I was diagnosed with ocd months ago, and I began taking fluvoxamine for it about days ago, less than weeksconfusion immediately, I noticed positive side effects and was doing relatively well. However, for the past few days, my anxiety has been spiking, and I have cried more these past few days than I ever have in my life. I have been so depressed all day because my anxiety keeps telling me that the meds are not working and that I never get better. However, I do know that symptoms can actually worsen at first before they get better because of the nature of increased serotonin in the brain. Have any of you experienced this? I feel so alone

Dont feel alone. I have been on a hell of a ride with prozac, but I am sticking it out, and I can honestly say it is getting better. After about a week of taking it, I felt wonderful. Then a small trigger set me into a tail spin, and I spent another week with nausea, dizziness not eating and depression, its getting better now. And I think in the end, this is going to work out. Try to stay positive and give it a chance, but if it does not work, then there is other medications to try. So do not let it feel like a setback.

If you and your doctor decide that prescribed medication is the best route for you, there are several options which you can take and continue breastfeeding. They include in no particular order. Sari, antidepressants, I sertraline, citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine all have anti anxiety activity.

Title: Had a job interview today showed up and nobody was there.
Thread
Had my first job opportunity in a year. I was nervous for the interview, but that is to be expected. Everything about the day was going smoothly. I was anxious and jittery and really dreading it, but I was pushing through and prepared to get it done. I arrive at the place I go inside and everything is closed down for the day. I know the time, date and location were absolutely correct. I wait for a few minutes before the panic sets in and I feel like I am about to break down all that stress and anxiety and preparation building up to this. I hurry back to my car and just sit there. I am in full freeze mode. I am upset. I am angry. I do not know what I am going to do next, but all I want is time to stop and everything to stop. I know the interviews a bust. At this point, I am too frazzled and upset, and I just want to get out of this situation. Now I have to deal with the next steps, calling the interviewer back, setting up a new date, dealing with the fucking embarrassment and shame of it all. I am just irrated and angry that it has to be this difficult that things could not just go smoothly. I am just dreading everything, and I hate it because I do not have any coping skills for this, and I never have that always how it is with me. I am goodUntil a hiccup and I have to change course, and things are not smooth and simple anymore. It makes me feel really depressed, because I am finally on a medication that I think works, but I guess only to help my day to day level of anxiety, it cannot give me coping skills to deal with this. I wish I was still in therapy, but I cannot do teletherapy, so it is not really possible at the moment anyways. Thanks for listening to me, rant it been a shitty day.

The only one who needs to be embarrassed and ashamed is the interviewer who made a big mistake and wasted someone is valuable time. You have nothing to be embarrassed about. I do understand how you feel, though, and it sucks. Just know you are not alone. The more practice and exposure you get with unpredictable situations, the easier it will become.

Kinda side note if you think your weighted blanket is broken, check if it is the blanket or just the connection to the cover. I thought I broke my blanket from walmart and bought a new one from giant tiger. I spent about hours reinforcing the stitching on the blanket so it would not break for lots. I cut open the blanket, I thought was broken, and found it was just the connection to the cover.

Title: Worried I am not pleasing.
Thread
I here of is we have a fantastic relationship and sex life, but I would say his sex drive is generally higher than mine. How can I break my uptight mentality when it comes to sex? I feel like I try to plan it out to much and worry that it is not satisfying if it does not go a certain way. For example, I feel like he is always dominant, and that is what I prefer. But what if he secretly wishes I was on top more? I just struggle with my overthinking about this. My man reassures me I am satisfying him, but I still cannot help but worry and feel bad. I also feel like he wants sex more than me.
Comments
Relationships are about compromise. He might be holding back a little out of respect for you, but that is how this stuff works. He does not need to have sex every time he wants to. He wants to have sex with you when you want to have sex with him. And if he says he is satisfied, then believe him, I think as women, we are conditioned to believe that we must keep a man completely sexually satisfied, or they will leave us. But a good man will be happy with the sex you are comfortable giving and will not be begging you for things you do not want to give

I just feel like myself, and I feel good, and I can actually get shit done in life. However, the other months I get horrible anxiety, and my body physically shuts down. As a result, it makes me not want to eat. Be I feel constantly nauseous, makes me not want to go in public nor talk to anybody in general. It seems to usually start in october, november, and these periods burn all the progress I make throughout the year when I am entirely myself. Its been happening for the last ish years. And I was just wondering if anyone else has this same battle. It destroys me on the inside. Be I know it is making miss many opportunities in life. Frown, sad, angry or pouting

Comments
Remember that it is extremely common to try multiple medications, dosages under a doctor direction, until you find the right one. For you, your doctor has very likely experienced this and was educated on this. It is their job to support you and ensure you get the best quality of care possible. Doctor would rather you come to them with these issues and allow them to do their job in supporting you. To be entirely clear if your doctor has been genuinely dismissive, unsupportive in the past, I in no way mean to invalidate this. If this is the case, that is their problem and they would be failing you. As a health practitioner, you may be able to find another doctor to work with you, and there are options for reporting doctor that fail their duty to you.

Anxiety does all kinds of weird stuff to your body. Muscle tension trouble sleeping. All that is really common with anxiety. I will not tell you not to worry, cause that is not how anxiety works laughing out loud. But trust your doctors try exercising some more, drink lots of water. Keep your mind and body busy. Plus exercise helps a lot with muscle tension. Good luck.

Itl be ok. Anxiety is tough. I had my first attack when I was, maybe since you have stated you are a kid, I am glad to hear your parents seem to be supportive of what you have been going through. Was there something especially stressful going on in your life right before they started? Stress can reach a point where it can absolutely bring on attacks. But its always best to go get the recommended tests done just to be on the safe side. If nothing shows up, there are lots of different things, from exercising to meditation to counseling all the way up to medication, if absolutely necessaryconfusion that can help you either get to the bottom of what is causing your symptoms or ways to better manage stress, sending you a hug, and it will be I smiling, face with open hands,

Yes, trust your doctors as much as your mind does not want to find comfort, knowing that these tests are coming back normal and that everything so far, physicallyconfusion is okay. My first panic attack came out of nowhere, and my anxiety has put me in the weirdest bubble of space and time that I could hardly put words to. And I keep trying to figure out exactly how I got here. But the more I try, the more I come up with absurd, irrational reasons. Anxiety is a menace. It really is. But you will overcome this at least to some degree. You will find clarity and understanding you are far from alone. My friend, white heart

Why do I still feel really anxious? I still scan my body for unusual things and still anticipating symptoms. There are days that I feel emotionally okay and not scared at all. But most days are just making me overwhelmed, and that feeling has not gone away ever since my last test. Now, I feel like theres a swollen lymph node on my armpit, and it only started last night. Could my anxiety be the issue? The encounter that I had was my first time exploring my sexuality with a man and told myself that it isnt for me. I have been a heterosexual ever since, and everyone know as one, I may have developed an irrational fear that I dont know. How am I going to overcome this? Could someone give me an advice on how to overcome this

Hi, friend, being anxious to start a new job is pretty normal about your previous job. Have you tried looking for counseling to discuss it? If you feel trauma about that, you should talk to a counselor about it. Mental health is important. You should start thinking about that and look out for help. Wish you well.

Thank you in advance.

I have gad and am driving. I am in the uk, however, I think since you say it has no impact on your driving, that you are fine.

I do not know if this is anxiety, but I keep repeating what to say to someone or replaying things I have to do the next day. So I do not forget I do not know if it is anxiety. Does anyone experience this?

I always repeat when I talk to my colleagues. It is not that I think they are thinking slow. It is more of me thinking I cannot express myself. So I have to repeat just to be sure.

I am in the grade years oldconfusion and I have been focused on going to a certain college since freshman year I used to have good grades and ever since zoom days my grades are averaging is and is my willingness to work is only decreasing and so is my will to live I am terrified of the future of growing up I feel like I am only going to be a failure I cannot be what my parents want me to be I am not smart enough to please them the idea of going to college and being independent is killing me. I worry about my future all the time I do not know what to do or how to fix my anxieties. I just want to die

I am sorry you are feeling that way. Frown, sad, angry or pouting. Please reach out to some counselors at your school. Theres nothing wrong with speaking with someone youre not weak for doing it either. On the other hand, I am a college student, finishing my fourth year here. I left my home in california and came to vermont. Mind you, I have no family in vermont. I am truly alone. I feared being independent and being away afraid I would fail and end up somewhere I did not want to be. However, that is not the case at all. It feels weird. Being an adult, its like everything just clicked. I became so preoccupied with my school work and social life that my worries about being independent faded. Its so weird, yet so fun, being independent feels so good. You have control of your like, youre taking the wheel and guiding yourself. Youre going to have ups and downs. But the most important thing is how you pick yourself up. You will not be a failure. Keep your head up, even when things get rough. Youre not weak for feeling that way either. Its okay. I know you are young. I was there once I feared going to college, not being able to succeed, I was scared of failure. I was scared to do things I did not feel comfortable with. I feared change. But good things happened. The more independent I became I want you to know there is so much more inLife you just got to work your way up there. Once you start something, youl see what I mean by becoming so preoccupied that you will not even worry about your fears hit me up if you want some advice on life and college lifestyle, I am more than happy to help out.

Title: Am I overthinking our friendship?
Thread
So I have this friend, but sometimes I question whether he is a real friend, but am not sure if it is just my anxiety that is making overthink things. At first he was always trying to include me in his friend group. But since I always deal with anxiety, I had a hard time opening up to him, but he was always patient with trying not to push me to talk, which slowly I started feeling more comfortable with talking to him, and we did ended talking with each other a lot more. I even told him the reason why I would not talk so much when we would all hangout as a group, which he told me that he never expected me to ever force myself to talk, which made me so happy to hear that he understood what I was dealing with. Sadly, lots of the times we all hangout as a group, it felt that he always had something to talk about with the rest of the group and little with me. And I never understood why when I talked to him about my hobbies and things I enjoyed with him. So I did not get why it felt as if it was so hard for him to have something to talk to me about. I do not know. I feel my anxiety just making it very hard for me to have a friendship with him to the point that I question whether he is my real friend or that he justKeeps me around because he feels bad for me. I also feel that I have to face the reality that because I did not talk most the time, that people will not feel comfortable talking to me, because I can be very quiet, which I can understand because I do not really feel comfortable talking to the group, but I do not understand my friend doing it to me.

Title: Why do I feel like I am trying to reach an end goal when talking to people?
Thread
Whenever I am having a conversation, I almost never feel like I am just in the flow and having fun, trying to just have fun makes it worse. I feel like I am manipulating the other person or thinking of what to say next. It sucks. This is constant daily. I had this problem when I was a teenager and then fixed it a while ago, but now it is. Come back, help!
Comments
It really hard to be in the moment in a conversation and enjoy it when you are not relaxed at all and worrying about everything you say or are hyper aware of how you are being perceived. I find it is difficult to get out of this pattern when my anxiety is high. So maybe try reducing stress in your daily life as much as you can. Being calmer overall will probably help with this kind of social anxiety.

Title: Worried I am not pleasing.
Thread
I here of is we have a fantastic relationship and sex life, but I would say his sex drive is generally higher than mine. How can I break my uptight mentality when it comes to sex? I feel like I try to plan it out to much and worry that it is not satisfying if it does not go a certain way. For example, I feel like he is always dominant, and that is what I prefer. But what if he secretly wishes I was on top more? I just struggle with my overthinking about this. My man reassures me I am satisfying him, but I still cannot help but worry and feel bad. I also feel like he wants sex more than me.
Comments
Ask him only he can answer that question. You can wonder all you want and drive yourself mad, or you can avoid all that, and just ask him make suggestions, though, do not ask what do you like? Think of options, positions, toys, clothes, whatever. And put that forward to him? That way he has options to choose from, or he may choose none, which is.

Title: My rock bottom, lexapro and steady recovery. It will get better confusion.
Thread
In late november of I had poor levels, tends to elevate anxietyconfusion was finishing college, creating an existential issueconfusion and was quitting nicotine after years of abusing tapes and all factors combined sent me into a full blown panic disorder. With gad, I would get the worst panic attacks to the point where they would give me full on adrenaline rushes and pins and needles throughout my whole body. I would not be able to think, which would spin my mind further out of control or elongate. The experience. These panic attacks became more and more frequent until I would have about per day and constantly feel anxious in between panic attacks. I got to a point where the anxiety was so bad I had to quit my job. I actually enjoyed the job and was becoming a pretty good salesman sporting goodsconfusion. After quitting, I was so scared to really do anything, mind you, I am a very active guy. I hike, fish hunt, snowboard, run, you name it to be so scared to leave. My room was crippling, and the depression and suicidal thoughts started creeping in. I have always been an upbeat guy and found ways to find some peace in hardship, but this was my absolute hell. My rock bottom in early december, a week or so later, my lovely mother decided to step in and help me the best option we could find at the time was to go to nearby behavioral health. This place was government subsidized dog poo. TheWorkers seemed to either not like their job or not know anything about mental health. I told one lady that I occasionally use marijuana to help me sleep, and she said, that could be the root of my issue, and that its also addicting. My god lady, I know what a weed panic attack is. I also know that im not toking up day and night to where it would be an issue. But she did say I should probably get on an sri. So I did. My doctor put me on my of lexapro, then my, although my doctor is knowledgable, in many ways, he did not explain any negatives of the drug, which they can be horrendous. Anyways, this at least helped me get some temporary relief. It was a good reset button. Its important to note that I started doing minutes to an hour of cardio everyday, crushed weights, meditated, developed better eating habits, saw a therapist and did lens treatment. Once a week, I saw my doctor a month later, and we tested my bloodwork. It turns out that my levels were terrible, so he prescribed levothyearoxine. Turns out, anxiety is a very common symptom of hypothyearoidism. My doctor still wanted me to stay on my lexapro to be sure. So I stayed on it. With being on lexapro, I gained about labs fairly quick, mostly fat. Despite exercisingconfusion, and my sexual libido was significantly reduced. Over time, I started feeling more mentally automated that my emotions felt less genuine, and myBrain was foggy. On top of that, I have been reading that lexapro can be very difficult to come off after prolonged and or high dose use, brain zaps, dizziness, nausea, bad, suicidal thoughts, arisment. Other mental issues, etc. Confusion around weeks into starting lexapro and weeks into starting levothyearoxine. I was doing much better regarding my anxiety, and I had a feeling my anxiety from late november december, was mostly from my nicotine addiction, and the thyearoid issue was the catalyst to make it worse. I did not want to rely on a pill that had that much power to carry the ability to completely alter my mind and have quite a list of negative side effects. Nope, I know there is a better way. So I started tapering off it had only been a little over months, so I didnt have to elongate the taper as much, basically going from my to being off in a sequence of reducing dosage by my per week. Currently, I reduced my dose to my for a week, and I felt way better. The sensation was as if my was too much and cleared up some of my side effects. Then yesterday I went down to my and I feel even better than before. But now some headaches and a light amount of irritability has arised. I expected to feel some light side effects. So these are not a big deal. My plan is to give myself a solid week of lexapro sobriety then start a shroom microdoseProtocol I will give myself a week, so I will have a baseline to measure my responses from plus a period of no substances is probably good for natural serotonin restoration. I would like to start with the fadiman protocol, then maybe move to the stamens stack, if need be. How am I now overall I am way better than I was back in november december, but it took hardwork, both mentally and physicallyconfusion. I am doing better every week. Some days are better than others, but I see my whole progress line as a mutual fund, where you will have dips, but the whole trend is up and onward. It has only been a little over months, and I proud of myself for what I have done. I am also proud of anyone else making progress in their mental journeys. It can be tough, but I promise it will get better when you try

Title: I failing again as a hypochondriac.

It all started during the pandemic. I discovered that I have hypochondria, intense fear of illnessesconfusion around, and yes it is difficult for me to handle. I would spend hours and hours searching for random diseases or illnesses that I think I have, and it just makes everything worse. But I know I aware that there is a chance that I do not really have that certain illnesses. But my mind plays tricks at me. I would feel some of the symptoms as soon as possible. My mind manifests. My mind makes me suffer all the time. My anxiety got worse last year because is a so. And you know what else is stressing me out? The fact that my own family invalidates my feelings and mental health, telling me that I too young not to be mentally fine when mental health problems do not define by age but experiences, but glad I was seeing improvements around ber months. The first month of this year was kind of good for me as well. And now I think it is coming back. I feel like I going back to zero square one. I so tired of suffering from this fear. I just want to have a good life again. I want to bring back the old bubbly and careless me again. Yet it is difficult

Stay away from google and other health sites as helpful as they are with learning about an illness or disease, they tend to make you connect your symptoms with that. If you are doing fine and you are healthy, theres no reason to worry. If you want, be on top of your health schedule, a yearly physical with your doctor, get a yearly check up. Dont look up how common a disease is or the likelihood of survival. Youre doing more harm than good when you stress out about this. Theres also nothing wrong with going to the doctor about feeling some pain or discomfort. Its better to just go to them and hear what they have to say. Peace of mind will greatly help you

Title: The stress is making me disassociate.
Thread
I cannot really feel present. I am not at the point of depersonalization or derealization, but I feel not connected to the world around me. The stress and constant worry causes me to zone out like everything is as it always was. But I run on autopilot. I cannot stay mindful for longer than minute. I can make my thoughts shut up due to meditation, but even when the head is empty of them, I do not feel connected to my environment.

Title: First panic attack in years because my dog is sick.
Thread
I suffered a lot from depression and panic attacks roughly between ages. It not been completely fine since then. Of course, I have had my struggles, but it is not been this bad. I feel like I need to keep it together because I am no use. If I am a complete sobbing mess, I try to take deep breaths. I try to think positive, but I am just so afraid that my dog will die. It seems unlikely yesterday it seemed like she was completely out of the woods. Then today she threw up again, and that is when I started panicking again and could barely phone the vet. They did not think we needed to come in again but keep her under observation. My husband has left for work. Luckily, he is not working that many hours but will not be home for about hours. And I am stuck out in the forest without a car. If we need to go to the vet, I either phone family neighbours or get a taxi. Please send positive thoughts that my dog will be ok. She my constant companion and best friend. She not even years old. She cannot die yet. I am disabled and housebound, I spend every minute with her. I have such anxiety. Now it is like my body is ice cold with fear. My ibs is not a fan back story about my dogs medical problems. On thursday evening, she had some dried meat to chew on and then started throwing upAnd making pitiful noises. She has a sensitive stomach, so not completely out of the norm. But I still worried. On friday morning, she was very down, almost apathic and did not want to eat, seemed dehydrated. So I consulted the vet, and we went to the emergency room. They took some blood tests and gave her fluids turned out her potassium was somewhat low, and her cop was at inflammationconfusion, so they wanted to do an ray and keep her overnight. Ray, with contrast fluid showed something was stuck in her esophagus, not completely blocking it, luckily, but could still be very dangerous if it did not move or damaged the esophagus it was quite far down close to the heart. Esophagus was swollen, they got a tiny bit of food in her, and she was more energised and curious. The next day, the blockage had cleared, but she did not want to eat. She quite picky, thoughconfusion. She did not eat until my husband came to see her after work, and then he got her to eat from his hand since then, she is gotten meds times a day to give a protective coating to the mucosa in the esophagus. She seems like she is been on the mend, getting more energised and playful every day, being back to her normal self yesterday until the evening after her last meal, when she sounded like she tried to clear her throat, trying to throw up, but that passed within a minute, and she was fine.I think the medicine might be what caused her to throw up as nausea is a side effect it seemed like the vet nurse indicated that when I phoned in panic after my dog threw up today it was about half an hour after she had her meds the nurse said to give her very small portions and limit the meds to twice a day and give many small portions of food the medicine needs one hour before or after between eating confusion I love my dog so much she needs to be ok send positive thoughts or pray or whatever your version is please
Comments
Holding on too tight is not good for you or the dog. Try to believe that the best thing for your dog will happen. Your dog sounds like a great companion, so I am sure she will be fine. But remember, animals are often a reflection of how we are feeling. Show her joy, smiles and plenty. Love, it will help her heal completely.

Title: Advice on dealing with grocery stores.
Thread
Maybe this is not the most common thing, but in the last few years, maybe with the pandemic too, it has become really hard for me to go to grocery store or when I do, I get so overwhelmed I forget things and buy way more than I actually need. I have thought of getting noise cancelling headphones, but the thought of having my ears covered in public scares the shit out of me too, because I think someone is going to approach me or attack me without my knowing. Does anyone else have advice for staying calm in the grocery store or public in general, grinning face with sweat
Comments
What your anxiety focused on, if you buy more than you want, take more time to prepare, write down what you want to buy and stick to. That anxiety is a part of it may be better or worse, but you are there for a specific thing to get the stuff you need. Being mindful may help or make it worse. Confrontation therapy is a thing experiencing. Getting through it nothing as bad as it feels before happening.

Comments
What done is done, decide on consequences for the future instead, if you want skin cancer has a multitude of causes. Sun burn is a risk increase, not a definite cause of it happening. If it is just once, do not mind it too much. Your body fights cancerous cells all the time. It usually not an issue handled briefly and invisibly take care of your physical issues right now. Rest and do some positive or relaxing things for yourself.

Its like instead of falling asleep as you would taking a nap, they instead just become rumination sessions with my eyes closed, which of course means I never actually nap and instead just have waves of panic. And the physical symptoms further prevent me from relaxingconfusion. My mind just never shuts off.

If I try to sleep in on the weekend after not getting enough sleep all week, that is when my worst intrusive thoughts come. I just want to be well rested. But once I have the opportunity to catch up, my brain is like, no, still stress forever.

Ye it sucks. Going to sleep is just waiting for the adrenaline to burn off as you lay down, trying to not think too much of anything but you cant.

Title: Let your light shine.
Thread
Congrats anxiety. We have all made it to wednesday. This is a weekly thread that serves as a place for us to shine some light on what is going well in our lives. It is easy for mental health subreddits to focus primarily on the negative. After all, we are not here because everything is going wonderfully. But once in a while, you get shown the light in the strangest of places, if you look at it right? So whether you made it out of bed today, spoke up in a meeting or class, rode the bus or just stepped outside. Please share with us what went well for you in the past week. Any accomplishment, victory, positive thought or action, no matter how big or small is welcome here.

Been in therapy for a while now I do not know if its helping or not at this point, but I am still here, and I am thinking of ways to live better this year.

Title: The stress is making me disassociate.
Thread
I cannot really feel present. I am not at the point of depersonalization or derealization, but I feel not connected to the world around me. The stress and constant worry causes me to zone out like everything is as it always was. But I run on autopilot. I cannot stay mindful for longer than minute. I can make my thoughts shut up due to meditation, but even when the head is empty of them, I do not feel connected to my environment.

That is what works for me. And sometimes it doesn. Happy face or smiley.

I do not know you can soldier on through the anxiety at first, and you may feel lessened anxiety through repetition, but eliminating anxiety totally in everyway it surfaces. I genuinely do not know if that is an acquirable goal important to note. This is, in my opinion, have saris helped you at all anxiety wise, asking because I was considering meds.

Title: Cardiophobia and fear of randomly dying.
Thread
Hello, since I cannot help myself with this, I am just going to vent here. Basically, it all started when I had couid back in october. That was a stressful period for me, and my heart reacted to it, and I had a fast heartrate, which I accidentally noticed and got scared about it when I googled about heart attacks, that when the anxiety started, I went to a doctor, they were not the kindest, and I was really scared and thought I will die. They told me to come again in a few days. Those few days, I could hardly sleep because of the fear that I will die in my sleep or that I will have a heart attack. I went again and again every night thinking, I will not wake up, that went for monthsconfusion. And when I finally got my results of all possible tests, everything was fine with my heart. They told me it is because of stress, and I was actually very relieved until the stress fucking returned. So months of anxiety every day thinking that I will not see tommorow. The only time I was at ease was when I am at school with friends, but otherwise, I was under stress had several panic attacks, too. Then I finally found out that my health is fine. And guess what? Shit never stopped. I would still think about my heart. I would constantly check my pulse. I would constantly google diseases just to rule them out or seek reassurance, literallyEvery time I was alone I would still just think about my heart and what if scenarios now I stopped googling symptoms and I am in the process of stopping checking my pulse but the fear is still there. I started going to the gym happy as all fuck that I will workout and be healthier and guess what? I see a fucking heartrate monitor at the treadmill and then I almost get a fucking panic attack on the first day of training like me and my friend were running on the treadmill. Our heartrate both at and then my fears kick in and it fucking jumps to immediately come on for fucks sake. How can I stop this whenever I see anything heart related I get anxious. I have developed so much reassurance methods. I forgot half of them by now. It has gotten to the point that I fear my thoughts more than I actually fear death or something wrong with my heart. I fucking avoid activities that I somehow think will make something happen to my heart. I stopped drinking coffee, because somewhere I read that it affects heartrate. Drank one in the cafe, because why not? And in the middle of drinking it, my fears kick in and my heart starts beating and I get anxious. I stopped eating salty food, because again, I read somewhere that it is bad for the heart. Now whenever I eat anything salty and notice it, I get anxious. Worst part it only happens when iAm alone with my thoughts. When I was with my friends, we were all eating something really salty, and I just did not give a fuck about it. And guess what? Nothing happened at all. No chest pain, no anxiety, no anything. But when I am alone, I always have to avoid millions of things, just so I do not accidentally trigger it. This shit is fucking killing me.

Hi. I have done a ton of exams for my heart echocardiogram, electrocardiogram hotter blood test I have done electrocardiogram and hotter in less then a month results all negative. My heart is healthy, so did my heart stop doing all this ship after every exam was negative? No, I still have a racing heart and random arithmic pulse. But sometimes when I do some random things and my mind is busy, I do not feel anything and I am okay. Try activities that keep you really busy like cleaning the garage. I personally avoid walking and running, because let us me think too much this will not overcome completely the problem, but helps to have some time where the mind is free and without the bum

Hopefully this will give you some much needed validation. I gave myself full blown ibs for years, straight, constant pain and worry sitting on the fucking toilet times a day, restricted diet, every test under the sun, they found noticeable inflammation when I had an endoscopy. But other than that, nothing, I thought there was no way anxiety could cause this because I was in pain, even when I was not thinking about it was constant. There were obvious physical issues reflux, toilet stuff, etcconfusion. And they saw inflammation. So how to could I be making it up right there? No way it was all in my head, because the proof was right there. Turns out I really underestimated anxiety, and the control our mind has over our body doesn really make sense to doubt that part, though, right? Our brain is constantly sending signals back and forth with our body if we are convinced that we are dying, maybe we are so convinced that our body actually starts to act like it is dying. I was part of a study about ibs that taught me this, but I think it applies to your scenario too. What I learned is this first, our brain starts to pay attention to sensations. It normally is not aware of digestive tract, heart rate, etcconfusion. We notice the weird feelings and assume something is wrong. Our brain sends a signal to our body heart intestinesconfusion. That something is wrong. Our body freaks out and causes pain, heart beats, faster intestines,Clench, get inflamedconfusion. Brain registers the pain, and the cycle continues for me what worked? Was consciously interrupting the cycle by thinking, oh, actually, I am fine. Or wow, my stomach feels so much better. Now it surprisingly effective. If you can tell your body that it is dying and it believes you, then you can also convince it that it is fine. Just takes a bit of practice when people say something is all in your head, it is not helpful because it implies that you are not having physical symptoms. The reality is, your brain can create physical symptoms, so it is in your head, and it is not just in your head. Look up the remedy app if you are interested. It is from the ibs study that helped me. But I imagine it could be helpful to you too. Also practice it when you are not at your most stressed. It is not super helpful when you are already panicking, weighted blanket and breathing is better for that. It more that the conscious thinking prevents the panic in the first place to some extentconfusion. Let me know if you have any questions, I am always happy to help someone going through something like this. If I can sorry for the essay laughing out loud. Oh and absolutely no coffee. You really do not need anything that make you more anxious. I have cut it out too, and it helps a lot

This is me to a been going through the exact same thoughts and feelings for months, had tests done, and they came back normal, been cutting back on salt and sugar in hopes it will miraculously keep me from dying young. I barely leave the house anymore in fear that I will drop dead in public, with no one around to help. Sadly, our minds can play really dirty tricks on us. I have been watching a lot of youtube videos on health anxiety and cut, and I have definitely noticed a difference in my anxiety levels and panic attack frequency. The anxiety is still there, but it is becoming more manageable. It helped tremendously with my catastrophzing and jumping to the worst case scenario. I especially love the channel therapy. In a nutshell, she has great advice and coping mechanisms to challenge these thoughts. Give it a try for a while and see how you feel. You all get through this friend

You were on such a low dose for such a short period of time, I would not be too afraid of addiction. I was taking it daily for months and did not have much of an issue getting off. But yes, it is ideal. Use is as needed for panic attacks or weeks at most. So as long as you are being cognizant, you will be okay.

Intrusive thoughts can be a symptom of anxiety and or depression, but they do not always mean you are depressed or that you have anxiety. I get anxiety attacks from time to time, and I have been depressed in the past, but I am not depressed now and definitely still get intrusive thoughts, particularly when in bed at night. I just wait til the next day and hope that they go away. Normally, the thoughts I have are not worth worrying about, but I let them take over

Title: Embarrassingconfusion. I am having an anxiety attack over diarrhea. Should I be afraid?

I am a freshman in college yesterday, one of my best friends just left for a few days because she tested positive for couid. I am kind of panicked. A lot of people at my school have been getting couid. I have been wearing my mask everywhere, doubling up on vitamin and drinking a lot of water. Sorry, this is kind of grossconfusion. I tested negative last night, but I woke up this morning, had a pretty normal bowel movement, and then went to breakfast. I had my usual bagel and an orange. Yesterday, I had a bagel for breakfast, a peanut butter sandwich with some graham crackers for lunch, a salad and french fries for dinner. And then I had a lot of nuts, a kind bar and some cheerios before bedconfusion. I also had a vitamin gummy before bed last night, because I am so worried about couid. And I took one again at breakfast with my prozac. I have anxietyconfusion. Immediately after breakfast, I had intense, kind of liquidy diarrhea. I do not usually get that from vitamin, but I remember having that a few months ago when I had too much fruit. I heard diarrhea is one of the first signs of couid. Should I be worried? Because I am lots of people are initially testing negative after exposure, but then finding out they have it a few days later, I am so scared I really do not want to be sick, I cannot afford to get sick, and I am suchA hypochondriac. I have been so worried all morning will I be okay?

No matter what you are going to be okay. There are so many reasons that you could have had diarrhea, but I do know that if you take more supplemental vitamin than your body needs, it simply does not use the excess. Sometimes that results in your body getting rid of it via diarrhea. Most of the couid cases people are getting now are flu, like or like, a bad cold. I just had it a few weeks ago, and it was not fun, but it also was not crazy, serious. I was still able to sit up all day and work from home. This bout of tummy upset is probably from nerves and or vitamin excess. But even if it was couid, you would be okay

Title: Anxiety of getting a disease from a stray animal.
Thread
So I have a crippling fear of getting especially rabies or some other disease from stray dogs and cats, which are too common in my country so much so that I see dogs attacking me. In my nightmares, I have been attacked by dogs at the same time once, but they could not make contact with me since there was a fence between there. No animal control in my country, so they roam the streets, attacking dozens of people every day. The funny thing is, stray animals are only collected for treatment or neutering, and they should be released back to streets. After that, by law, I think hurting them is illegal, too. What should I do? I experienced a similar thing during summer time, where a cat scratched me and I had a two week anxiety of tetanus, where I could not sleep, becouse of anxiety

Not really anything to be worried about. Rabies is curable as long as it does not progress. You should consider carrying a high powered stun gun if there is really such issues in your area.

Title: Feel like im losing my mind.
Thread
Ink how to explain this but I know im real and alive but at the same time I dont like why is my brain trying to convince me none of this is real im genuinely scared im losing my mind amp it all started when I first experienced derealisation I just kept overthinking about it every since it happened to the point where I started thinking what if im in a coma and none of this is real I really dont know why my brain is wiring itself like that but I cant seem to find a reason that would convince me this is all real its like my brain has just convinced that we live in a simulation or something and I dont want to think that way at all I genuinely feel like im going insane the only thing keeping me sane is that fact I feel like im going insane. Cause if let us say we were in a simulation coma dream, I do not think we will ever question it. But here I am questioning everything main problem im just so frustrated that I cant prove reality and there is absolutely no way to prove it
Comments
You are not going insane. I have dealt with this too. Heres the thing there are questions we will never know. The answer to it does not matter if it is a simulation, if it is a dream, a coma, etc. It makes not difference what it is. You are not in control of it regardless, control the things you can and accept the things you cant.

Title: If I do not exercise, my anxiety starts to spike.

So I am not complaining, but I kind of am because I know some people who do not exercise and do not have anxiety, and they do not need exercise to prevent anxiety. But I notice that if I do not exercise on a regular schedule, my anxiety will come back, raging. I am on lexapro. So I thought I would not need the exercise, but it looks like I do.

Exercise helps me some, too. It does not make it go away, but it does help me manage it. Not my favorite thing either. I am one of the probably many people who have trauma from public school pe classes, and I do not want to exercise. I resisted it for a long time, and the thought of doing it preparing for it actually gives me some level of anxiety, and I do not enjoy it, like some people say they feel good or enjoy it while they are doing it. And I do not really get that. It feels like another chore to me and kind of an extra stressful one if I am going to a gym or a pool where people can see me, I try to ignore, avoid the people who treat the gym like their church and basically evangelize about how wonderful all aspects of exercise are like that is great for you. But leave me alone. I do not actually like it that much. I am just trying to cut down on panic attacks and not die. And this is what I have to do. But afterward, I do feel better, both physically and mentally, and the feeling persists past that day, especially if I can work it in a few days a week. I look at it kind of like, take your vitamins or eat your vegetables. When you were a kid, it not enjoyable to me. I do not want to do it, but I accept that somethingAbout it actually does work in terms of making me feel better. So I try to suck it up and do it anyway. Personally, I probably would not bother if I were on vacation. Since for me, that usually is going to involve walking places, doing active things, staying in a place with a pool, etc. So I would be getting physical activity anyway. My problem is more when I get busy with work and home stuff and cannot fit it in, my job is about as sedentary as it gets. So it is really bad for me not to work in exercise during the normal course of things, just from a physical health perspective, not even taking the anxiety into account. But of course, that gets worse when I do not exercise too.

Title: Manual breathing, but with thoughts and feeling too aware.
Thread
Does anybody else constantly analyse themselves? Like I am constantly analysing my behaviour and the behaviour of those around me? I also have this thing where when I try to relax, I think to myself, im relaxed. And then, like the manual breathing thing, I get stuck in this state where it feels like I am manually relaxing and it is difficult to let myself go.
Comments
Most definitely, I am always over confusionanalyzing everything. Being hyper aware has always been a problem in my life. Sometimes it helps, but the anxiety around that comes with it. And then being aware of being hyperaware, thats where the overwhelming feeling of needing to take a breather and step back really take flight. Its a cycle, a never ending one at that, it feelsconfusion unamused face.

My take on this is that it feels more high risk be. There are less visual cues for us to assess our performance. In my personal experience with social anxiety, I am usually hyper attuned to cues from other people on whether or not I am doing well in the interaction. Whether it is accurate or notconfusion. With phone calls, there is nothing to assess during pauses. There is only an incomplete picture both of the other person and of how they see you. My only advice is to practice calling places more unscripted that the hard part, the exposure part. Maybe something that would help is remembering how you feel when you get phone calls. Are you focused on yourself or the other person? Most people are focused on themselves and will not pay as much attention to your purported fuck ups as you will. Really, nobody is perfect in interactions. It is their ability to take it in stride that makes it not awkward. Also, do not underestimate how scary the phone calls you are making would be even for people without anxiety. It really scary to call about work. You never know what is going to happen or who is going to reject you or even ask you questions on the spot. With anxiety, it used to take me weeks just to fill out job applications, because I was anxious about them being read, so do not beat yourself up for having trouble. You still need to do it for yourself but doNot beat yourself up. Remember that the more you do it, the easier it will get. Try to ask about work from places you do not actually want to work at in a non committal way. So you can practice the flow of the script. You have that way. You will not care as much about the outcome. The more you master that ambiguous language of inquiring. But lookin at all of your options means confusion. You will not feel guilty. Ab calling to practice and confusion. It gives you actual practice in using that language and display that confidence. See where there is flexibility for you to improvise in your script. Those are the areas that will give you confidence. As you improvise more, work on building your confidence, rather than trying to hide your anxiety. Mainly, the anxiety will naturally start to go away once you realize you are a good candidate for work and can sell yourself well, it is just a matter of what you are anticipating. Good badconfusion about your performance. Remember, try to only put your energy worrying about what you can control. You can control how you act, how hard you push forward despite it all, how you think about mistakes, you can control how other people react to you or what they think and what they think of you in any scenario is not indicative of who you are as a person or what you are capable of. Like, if you hear a small waver in their voiceAfter you speak like they are unsure of what to say. Try to be aware if you are thinking something like, oh god, why did I say that it was so stupid? They think I am so weird? I screwed it up already confusion. Usually, those things are not about you and are just natural imperfections in how people speak like I said, it is normal for people to regularly say the wrong thing. Pause when they speak, say the wrong words. However, if we do not like ourselves, we tend to assume it is about us and the mistakes we made they are responding to confusion. Irl. I have noticed most interactions are very forgiving. You can make a mistake or say something awkward. Keep going, and they forget. I have gone through this process at my new job and trying out talking to people every day every single time I starting ruminating in conversation about how I had said something awkward and assumed what the other person thought. I immediately became less present, and my vibe became more anxious, preoccupied. Alternatively, people actually forget awkward bits, if you do and will latch onto when you sound more confident and respond to it, being able to forgive your own mistakes actually reads as confidence. I would recommend going on youtube and looking up techniques for mindfulness with social anxiety and self loathing, or just tips on how to deal with social anxiety. I have some great videos I can send you if you want themI think it might give you some ideas on where to go from here. I know you did not list social anxiety, but I feel like if you hate yourself and hyperfocus on how other people see you negatively when you speak, it is similar. Best of luck, friend, I know you can do it. You re doing the hard part right now edits for readability.

I despise phone calls will bend over backwards to avoid them. My new job, I have to make a mixture of business calls and client calls. I dont mind the business calls. Cos there is a script to follow. Neither of us deviate from it. Its basically just a transaction in a store. The client calls are hell, I work in estates, so clients are grieving but always seem to be incredibly greedy, which makes them so angry, demanding money, not understanding delays, etc. Ive outright refused to make those calls. My supervisor is nice enough to humor me for now, but that wont last forever. I feel so sick at even the though of it, no matter how many times I run through a script in my head. Its still so much more awful than I expect. I hate confrontation too, so anyone in a bad mood just makes it so much worse, too def feel for you in that position, too wish I didnt have such thin skin and be affected by these things so much

Weird question, but I found a massive trigger to up increase my anxiety is caffeine. No idea why, but I have a large coffee, and that night I will be questioning my job whether I am going to get fired. All the things I do not do well freaking out about something someone said, etc. The thing is though, when things get that bad, I start to panic and try to smash work out. I go above and beyond on a report because I am anxious I am getting fired or work on things at night because I am worried what everyone thinks of me at work, etc. Because of this, when I find I got a bunch of work, I have to do that. During normal anxiety times I procrastinate, freeze up, can send an email, I then down a bunch of coffee, and mins later, I start freaking out of losing my job and how shit I am that I push myself and slam all that work, even if I do not sleep for a few days in a row. I then get great reviews that allay my feelings of anxiety. Still, though I feel exhausted afterwards, but it works, I assume most will say its a bad thing, and you are probably right, but part of me is worried because I feel like I ve got to where I am. Partly because of my anxiety. In that way, it kind of scares me that if I tried to get it fixed, I noLonger will not be able to give as great work, or I will not be as nice to people because I am not anxious in what they think about me, etc. Interested to hear others thoughts, does anyone else use their anxiety that way?

Definitely I have the same coffee caffeine trigger too. And recently I decided to let my anxiety drive me nuts so I can learn to open up and let go in therapy. I am letting the anxiety torture me into submission and stop trying to control everything I love coffee and it provides health benefits that outweigh the cons for me right now. So I am unwilling to give it up for anxiety benefits. What I suspect is that if our anxiety improved a lot, I do not think we would not be able to put forth enough effort at work. I think we could still do it, but we would learn to cruise through working late and make it fun by listening to music, chill with a nice drink or whatever makes us feel good while we do it. We could learn to not dread this and no longer need to be anxious and panicked to do it. However, I think it will take time for now. I would probably continue to do exactly what you are doing until you are able to figure out how to complete tasks without using fear as a motivator. And I do have the exact same thoughts as you about work. I helped a couple of my coworkers with some of their projects recently because they were drowning in work, and my workload was lighter than usual. I have been panicking that I do not do enough, and someone will notice and fire me. So I let this fearMotivate me to save the day for my coworkers who were very grateful for the help.

Title: Does anyone try taking advantage of their anxiety?
Thread
Weird question, but I found a massive trigger to up increase my anxiety is caffeine. No idea why, but I have a large coffee, and that night I will be questioning my job whether I am going to get fired. All the things I do not do well freaking out about something someone said, etc. The thing is though, when things get that bad, I start to panic and try to smash work out. I go above and beyond on a report because I am anxious I am getting fired or work on things at night because I am worried what everyone thinks of me at work, etc. Because of this, when I find I got a bunch of work, I have to do that. During normal anxiety times I procrastinate, freeze up, can send an email, I then down a bunch of coffee, and mins later, I start freaking out of losing my job and how shit I am that I push myself and slam all that work, even if I do not sleep for a few days in a row. I then get great reviews that allay my feelings of anxiety. Still, though I feel exhausted afterwards, but it works, I assume most will say its a bad thing, and you are probably right, but part of me is worried because I feel like I ve got to where I am. Partly because of my anxiety. In that way, it kind of scares me that if I tried to get it fixed, I noLonger will not be able to give as great work, or I will not be as nice to people because I am not anxious in what they think about me, etc. Interested to hear others thoughts, does anyone else use their anxiety that way?

Coffee makes me anxious. And, well, this is going to make me sound like a lush, but I do not drink it without liqueur, it evens it out. Except if I have been sleeping for days and days and barely getting up while depressed, then I might drink half a cup and do chores, but only rarely, even when I feel like that.

See the trick is to get a feel of the minimum time it will take you to do something then procrastinate until you have just a bit more time then that I cannot will myself to start otherwise because I am not stressed enough why fight the procrastination if you have a solid game plan

Title: Getting first tattoo but artist is unresponsive.

It my first tattoo so I really want to feel comfortable with the tattoo artist I decided to work with this guy that my friend recommended and paid deposit however I really am disappointed with his communicating style and service he said there is no need for a consultation session and we just text to communicate I asked about the whole tattoo process but he did not answer plus he has a tendency to give short no reply to my comments on the design he sends over the design quite quickly but I really wish he would be more willing to give advice, discuss with me. I have always been quite intimidated by tattoo artists, and this experience is really not helping. I feel very not in control of the situation since he is often not responding. I really do not know how he thinks about my comments, and I keep assuming that he thinks I am annoying. I truly think his behavior is impolite, and it does not make a difference that he is an artist.

Tattoo artists are just like that. I try to go in to talk to them in person. They are usually terrible at responding to calls, texts, but will respond to do on insta. If they are a good artist, they will have a bunch of morons messaging them. And some serious people, they are usually busy and get way behind on filtering through their messages for their serious clients. They really should have the shop appreciates assisting with managing their scheduling, but it does not always work that way.

Title: I failing again as a hypochondriac.
Thread
It all started during the pandemic. I discovered that I have hypochondria, intense fear of illnessesconfusion around, and yes it is difficult for me to handle. I would spend hours and hours searching for random diseases or illnesses that I think I have, and it just makes everything worse. But I know I aware that there is a chance that I do not really have that certain illnesses. But my mind plays tricks at me. I would feel some of the symptoms as soon as possible. My mind manifests. My mind makes me suffer all the time. My anxiety got worse last year because is a so. And you know what else is stressing me out? The fact that my own family invalidates my feelings and mental health, telling me that I too young not to be mentally fine when mental health problems do not define by age but experiences, but glad I was seeing improvements around ber months. The first month of this year was kind of good for me as well. And now I think it is coming back. I feel like I going back to zero square one. I so tired of suffering from this fear. I just want to have a good life again. I want to bring back the old bubbly and careless me again. Yet it is difficult

You are not failing. I felt this way myself. I am also a hypochondriac. I have asthma and really sensitive skin, and thats how it all started for me. I had this crazy rash, and I thought, the worst turns out it was eczema. Everytime it returns, I get very anxious. As for the asthma thing, I learned to accept stress can make symptoms worse and can cause flare ups, and that is exactly what have happened.

I hate having to talk myself up for work, because I mostly hate myself, so it always feels forced and I find it so uncomfortable here is part of the source of your anxiety around this situation. Not hating yourself can take a lot of work. I hope you are working on it for your own sake, but improving that is not as easy as hearing an internet stranger say, love yourself in the meantime, do you have a script that talks about yourself in a way you find authentic? Are you actually good at the thing? Do you have happy clients? Are you excited about certain opportunities, etc? I know you have a script for voicemails, but do you have a list of bullets for the answered calls, too, that might help you at least get a foothold on the issue? Talking on the phone is hard. I used to have to cold call clients and always hated it. But scripts made a big difference for me if I find myself avoiding a particular thing because of anxiety, I set a timer for something short minutesconfusion, and I just do the thing until my timer dings. If I can force myself to do that, it usually works. And the payoff of not having to worry about the thing makes me actually set the timer most of the time. Sometimes the whole damn thing can be done in that dedicated minutes, and I can see the anxiety of putting it off was actually much more painful.Than just doing it yay. Sometimes the thing is almost done when the timer dings and the dread of leaving it unfinished is too great, so I just finish up after the timer. Sometimes the thing needs much more time, but I really cannot stand to keep doing it, so I walk away and do it all again at the same time the next day. But at least I do not nag myself so much about avoiding the thing because I objectively did part of the thing.

While I do not know for sure, a thought that is crept up in my mind is after you go through an extended period of stress panic, it can take its toll on your body those sorts of situations where you feel like you are having a panic attack but you have a more steady state of mind could maybe be the fallout from previous panic attacks. At the very least, I think that is what I might be experiencing right now.

Had to put the family dog down weeks ago, which made me feel my own mortality, and my health anxiety got another flare up. Triggers can really give you that impending doom, sort of feeling and make you feel like there is no hope for things to get better. But what you need to keep in your mind is these thoughts eventually will go away. It could be a good idea to see a counsellor or therapist if the fear is to the point it is debilitating you, though.

Title: About to catch a flight.
Thread
I just need to feel well, I have been dealing with high amounts of anxiety lately, and alot of panicking came to the airport early, and I already knew my baggage was a little over the limit, but oh, well, I needed to pack everything. I could. Everything was fine until I was at the check in. And as soon as I saw that the weight was over the limit, my mind began to worry, heart racing, hyperventilating, shaking. I thought I was going to faint. Also, my damn mask keeps suffocating me. I felt I was not breathing, but the attendant let the baggage through with no additional cost. Thank god. But I just panicked heavily. I lost control. I have been anxious to return home, and I wanted this day to come so badly, and its just the beginning of the day, and I am already having anxiety and panic. Its a one day trip, and I just want to make it home. My mind begins to tell me something is wrong, and I begin to panic once again, I know im fine, and it is just anxiety, but sometimes it just overwhelms my mind and my whole body. I came to take a seat and drink water, and im chilling once again, its just so uncomfortable. It comes from the smallest of things sometimes, and other times it just comes outta nowhere. I just needed to vent a little. Hopefully, I will not get anxious during my flight.

Phone calls are random and uncertain, so we might feel anxious about situations we cannot handle or predict. This is my experience.

You know what is embarrassing? I cannot even order, take out. I have to have my wife make the call for me nearly years old, and I cannot make a simple damn phone call. No advice, but you are not alone.

I hate phone calls because I feel like I am expected to talk in person. You can distract with other things. But in a phone call, there is no escape. I hate phone calls, and everyone I know knows this about me laughing out loud.

But as an answer my therapist suggested phone calls are so difficult because we cannot see their expression or read the tone of voice as well so it is harder to tell how they are feeling and accommodate for

I am so bad at phone calls I just really pulled a on myself and got a job where I have to make phone calls all the time. The exposure therapy of it has really helped. I called and made a vet appointment for my dog the other day with no issues now if only I could make my own appointments

I actually find phone calls easier than talking to someone face to face. Maybe it is because I do not see the person. I still hate it, but it is better than when the person is just staring at me, waiting for me to be able to put a sentence together.

Not general kind of shaking when scared but specifically strong tremors when lowering your arms or trying. Do lean down to tie your shoes. For example, I really wonder if that is possible or if it is something else.

Op. I totally hear you and have been going through the same for the years myself. One thing that helped me was realizing that it there is a difference between procrastinating and executive dysfunction. Procrastination have a thing that needs doing, but no interest in doing it and actively seek ways to avoid doing the thing. Executive dysfunction have a thing that needs doing, want to do the thing but get overwhelmed, exhausted, just thinking about how to start or pursue the thing and wind up trying to do anything else just to get the feeling of accomplishment. About years ago, I got tested for adhd, and turns out I have it co morbid with my depression, and they feed on each other. Medication helped to break through some of the executive dysfunction, and then building some steady, low effort habits to start the win train. Best advice from my therapist was newton. Laws apply to mental health too, objects, peoopleconfusion in motion tend to stay in motion. Obviously, I am not a doctor and will not advise you to do anything without getting professional advice and help

Yes, with school, I am always doing good that first trimester then and trimester comes and I have no motivation, so I do not do much work. But then I see that not much work is being done so I try to do work but there is too much and then I just shut down. This has been happening for a couple years ink how to break the cycle.

I also experienced pretty bad disinterest in activities and it took me awhile to notice that it was actually major depressive disorder. I am by no means a doctor so just sharing what worked for me here I did suffer from depression in college after my dad passed away but I was still able to enjoy my favorite pastimes and procrastination go tosconfusion. It was not until about two years later after another major life curveball hit re my career that spiraled me into just wanting to be on my bed couch and feeling like my career was in a dead end. So what did it all matter over time, I noticed that I was pretty blah people would ask to hang out and I would find excuses to stay in. And overall, I was not myself. I thought being in nature exercising and eating healthier would help, but they didnt. I went to therapy, and my therapist helped me see that at that point in my depression, I had a chemical imbalance that needed medicationand. I was super anti meds. But honestly, the difference in energy just taking the mildest dose of what was given to me was insane. Its been years, and I am completely off meds. But also in a better career. And feeling like my life is going somewhere. Of course, I developed anxiety disorder during my last job. So just dealing with that, but it is a different procrastination to the one I suffered with depression. And depression comes and goesFor mei can be in an upswing or a downswing from month to month, but feel like I can handle what life throws at me so much better. Now, to do, definitely talk to a therapist about your disinterest in activities, not having a passion. See if they have one of those depression questionnaires to test your level of disinterest. See if anxiety may also be playing a role here. Be open to what they suggest it can really help you.

I am in my mid, as the couid is still going on, the economy is always changing, and so is the company. Goals and direction restructuring is often happening, and some of us were assigned new tasks last year. I was too anxious to start learning new stuff, and now I feel I am left behind, while the other ladies are doing ok. At least they do not look. They have problemsconfusion to cut costs. Company is trying to get rid of people. They will not fire staff, but they will make the situation unbearable. So people resign on their own. I feel that is where I am now. I do not know what is going to happen in the future, but at least I have started to ask one of the girls about the tasks that I should be learning last year. Most of the times I do not know whether I am too stressed or anxious to do stuff or simply too lazy and too comfortable doing my old duties that I avoid learning new stuff.

Home prices are not going to change by taking drugs or any other action from your side. I think the most important thing you say is that you want kids find a woman who really want that too.

Adderall and anti depressants helped me. I used to have these long periods of doing nothing, and then long periods in which I did a shit ton of work and caught up on everything I was behind in. Now I stay in the middle of that, and I am pretty happy about that. I would say, try to fing something that gets you to that middle and away from the extremes.

I pretty young. So my advice is probably not as valuable as someone with more experience, but when I feel overwhelmed by my inability, lack of motivation to achieve something, I ask myself how important that thing really is to me. If it is important to you, consider that you may be burned out and need a break. I imagine you feel like you are running out of time, but your life is not on a deadline. Give yourself time to recollect, so that you can approach your goals with a clear head and full energy. It is pointless to tire yourself out trying to accomplish something you are not ready to do, and you will only end up wasting even more time procrastinating, as I said, though, I am not an adult, so I am basically only really offering headspace advice, not sure what might be complicated given your age circumstances

It wonderful. The advice given here and something perhaps I can add of value, maybe, is that we can all at least recognise that this seems to be a universal problem right now, and that so many people are feeling the same way you re not alone. My only advice would be to never underestimate the importance of connecting with people getting out of your comfort zone intentionally and a healthy diet, exercise and routine. I have started taking some herbal remedies like ashwagandha and theanine, which seem to be helping you can read about these. Maybe they might help. I think it reminds me of a famous philosophical debate, ideology about this notion of waiting and inaction, and that, in a sense, the only way for our own sanity and sense of progress is to do something it does not matter what, because standing still is like death, a form of death, to stand still and do nothing. We re buggered if we do not, and we are buggered if we do good luck anyway,

Every week, drop one bad habit and gain one new good habit until you have a more stable and fulfilled lifestyle. It takes a bit of reflection, though, being really honest with yourself and discipline. So first, what are your weaknesses? Do you eat late? Do you not clean your living space in the morning? Or when you should do you drink, play video games, masturbate. Isolate yourself more often than you should do. Spend too much money on bullshit. Think long and hard about your bad habits and eliminate one a week. Second, do the same. But the opposite for good habitsconfusion could you exercise more? Should you reach out to family and friends? More? Should you socialize more? Do you make your bed in the morning? Can you start cooking dinner for yourself more? Think about one good habit that you could incorporate into your life every week. You have to be patient, but continue doing this weekly and overtime. This will build up your self esteem. For sure, eventually, the good habits should snowball into the big life changes you want for yourself, but you have to be consistent. It not a magic pill. Good luck.

The key to breaking this cycle is not a motivation trick or a technique to become more productive. What you need to develop is a mindset that it is ok to fall behind. Sometimes it is perfectly normal not to accomplish as much as you have set out to do it ok to distract yourself and reach a mind state of worrying, less about trying to do everything. Once the guilt of procrastination lessens, you will be able to focus more on tackling the goals you have to do and will not pre emptively stress yourself about not being able to accomplish those goals

I have gone through this for many decades history, anxiety and depression, probably high functioning, as I have always been able to appear like I am doing fine on the outside job, kids, etcconfusion. Definitely seek out mental health therapy, psychiatrist with meds, definitely try it. This was something I definitely needed at a few different points in my life, and that is, okay, exercise. I am not talking iron man here, but put yourself on a schedule. Think of it like a prescription. Go for a walk outside every day. It tricks your brain into feeling more positive and motivated. This one is hard when you are in the depths of how you are feeling, but when you are feeling motivated, find a few hobbies that interest you crafting, woodworking, photography, etc. This will come in handy when you are feeling down, gives you a sense of accomplishment. Hope it helps, and good luck.

I would love to know, too. I am stuck in this vicious at work and cannot seem to get out of it. But the anxiety and avoidance is so bad it is also messing with my cognition and memory. So I feel like I can barely do anything at all other than eat. Go on reddit and very simplistic tasks. Anything requiring concentration, decision making or critical thinking feels impossible, which isnt great for an engineer, skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant.

Instead of focusing on negative things like what you are giving up and what will be difficult, focus on the positives. Instead, I am sure the extra money will be nice and the extra freedom that comes with it. You all get to challenge yourself in some way at work and feel the usefulness and satisfaction of doing something. It gives you structure back in your day, which is a positive thing for mental health, opportunity to make friends at work at your own pace, to feel life being out in the community and seeing people splurging on lunch at a nearby restaurant, etc. Anxiety programs you to seek out all negative possibilities to prepare for the worst, do the opposite. Wonder what will happen if it actually turns out to be a good thing?

For those of you that live in cold climates and go to gym to help with anxiety if you cannot make the gym for a week because you hurt yourself or your on vacation, what do you do to help combat the anxiety?

If something hurts you rest it. Something like the back would make it harder to work out in general, as opposed to an arm injury, where you could focus on legs. I would suggest another self improvement hobby maybe read, even if it is an exercise book, learn a language, play, an instrument, meditate, do yoga. If your back permits replacing working out with something that gives the same feeling of satisfaction. And progress should fill the temporary void, or if you are able just chill and take it easy.

I think you explained it very well. Psychs do not need to hear specific jargon to know what you mean. I think if you read this post verbatim, your doctor will have an idea for a next step.

I am sure people will be using masks long after this as a matter of comfort or personal safety. One consideration to keep in mind is that once mandates are gone, businesses may opt to refuse mask wearing business. While this may seem silly, in some cases, I understantongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. A store around here was robbed, and they could not id the person. Due to mask glasses, hat, they implemented a no masks allowed policy which was overruled by the city when a mandate came back out. As soon as it went away up went, the no masks allowed sign only mention that because I can certainly see some places asking their patrons to be unmasked for security purposes down the road. Much like banks ask you to take off glasses, hats, hoods, otherwise keep on masking up.

Howdy psychiatrist here, just talking generally, please do not interpret as directed medical advice as it is notconfusion. Prozac, and its sri counterparts are first line pharmacological treatments for gad and panic disorder. They are not like benzodiazepines, and do not work immediately. Or profoundly, most people will only notice their effect once it is pointed out to them by a family member, partner or friend. They are very effective, however, and work very well in conjunction with psychotherapy. Sis for the treatment of anxiety, often takes higher doses and longer periods of time to work versus the treatment of a major depressive episode, where you might see traction for depression at my at weeks, anxiety tends to require doses of my and weeks before you achieve an appreciable effect. Major side effects include confusion, nausea, vomiting, worst in the first days, and often resolves shortly after this can be mitigated by taking it with food confusion, loose stool, frank diarrhea, also in the first days, also resolving shortly thereafter, and also mitigated by taking with food confusion, headache, usually about of folks also resolves in days confusion, decreased sex drive and delayed orgasm happens in about of folks. Its troubling to many. So it is worth discussing. Please know that just because one sri caused this side effect, it does not mean that others in the drug class will. That means you can switch to another in the class. Should the side effects become intolerable on a certain one, there are other obviconfusion side effectsThat you can look up and I am sure you haveconfusion but those are the heavy hitters. Overall. Prozac is a medication that has been safely and effectively used for the treatment of anxiety in millions of people worldwide, with about years of documented safety and efficacy if taken daily as prescribed, these are not take only when needed. Drugsconfusion, it can be very effective at managing the over abundance of anxiety that can take over a persons life. I cannot recommend or tell you to avoid prozac. I can only tell you what I said above. We got the evidence that it is safe, well tolerated and effective, especially when combined with therapyconfusion. My sincere hope is that you find peace and wellness irrespective of the path you take to get there.

Anybody who has taken prozac for anxiety did you get any bad side effects and how likely are bad side effects I have been prescribed prozac but I am very nervous about the potential side effects it can cause I do not know if I am ready for antidepressants but my doctor did prescribe them to me so I do not know my anxiety is making me not want to take the thing that might help me

As someone who works in the field, it is a mixed bag. Some people get zero side effects and feel better within a month. Some people get side effects in the first two weeks that go away once levels, even out. Some people feel discomfort that persists. You never really know. What you do know is that prozac hits peak effectiveness at weeks or so you re probably already uncomfortable. Prozac has a chance to help. If you feel yucky on it. You stop taking it after talking to your prescriberconfusion. Maybe prozac will cure you. Maybe not that the game, it about finding the right medication to feel better and stop worrying if prozac is not it, you and your doctor cross it off the list and try something else. Every attempt is a step closer. Think long term

If you have not tried it yet would suggest journaling you can write about a number of things and another suggestion would be to write about your feelings in doing this you may find that some of those bad feelings you have carry less weight the other thing it does is allow you and your subconscious mind to come to grips with some irrational fears you may have picked up through the years I have suffered from ptsd depression and anxiety for about years now I have never found any meds that worked for me and I have tried most of them but happy to say did just buy a house and had a child at the age of three years ago

I did not do well on prozac to treat my anxiety but I know a number of people who did do well with it each individual is different when I tried it was a fairly low dose and for a week straight I could not sleep more than hours a night was over heating and unable to cool down and had strong dizziness and confusion turns out I had some kind of allergy to it and my doctor had me stop taking it immediately and I was able to recover

My mother used fluoxetine for about years from an outward perspective, it seemed to make her kind of spacey. And just a little dull after years, this is coming from her being very gifted, intellectually. She was a mensaconfusion. She also seemed to not have much drive. After a while, her memory seemed ok, though she also died pretty young of a brain tumor, I wondered if it may have been assisted by prozac as she was very healthy. Otherwise, that said, if the benefit outweighs the cost, I would go for it. Personally, I have been looking into taking it short term to get through a difficult time of my life.

Title: Anyone else feeling triggered by true crime.
Thread
Tldr. My key question is in the title, and at the end of the text, I feel very alone with this. I really feel heavily drawn to true crime podcasts, documentaries and books. I was always really interested in the psychology of the perpetrators and the police work. But since I deal with anxiety, it started years ago, after having my it childconfusion, I have a feeling it triggers my anxiety and panic attacks. Whenever I consumed true crime, I have trouble sleeping for several nights cannot be home alone, especially at night, cannot deal with silence because I start hearing strange noises in and around the house, and sometimes I have nightmares that can trigger panic attacks. I also noticed I started getting really paranoid of people not just for my own safety, but for my kids safety as well. Pretty much every other person looks or acts suspicious. In my mind, I still feel very drawn to true crime content and struggle to stay away from it completely. But I think I need to make the choice to not consume this content at all anymore for my own. Well, being that one reason I stopped consuming daily news, which was much easier for me to quit whenever I tried to talk to someone about this, people do not really get why I feel influenced as heavy by things like that, and they do not really get why I am even interested in true crime while also feeling triggered by it. So I feel prettyAlone with this problem? In the end, all I would like to know is, am I alone with this? Or are other people triggered by true crime in that way, just like me and started avoiding it completely?

True crime and anxiety have an overlap of preparedness. Most people with anxiety will explore every way things can go wrong with the belief that having considered this event occurring, you will be more ready to face it, or it will not hurt. As muchconfusion. Seeing true crime shows also shows us how to take steps to reduce being victimized. You feel more prepared because you know what to look out for, which feels good when you are safely watching on a screen. So it is not hard to imagine why this could be triggering for people with anxiety. For example, some people may watch a true crime show and think, whoa, I am not safe at all from random things or great. Now there is all these other things I have to worry about

I am not sure what your age is, so my words might not be as impactful. However, I myself felt the same as your and I am in college. About to graduate. My first two years here made me feel like I did something wrong to prepare myself. I felt I was a failure. For so long, I tried getting a contract with the navy through rotc. I never met the standard. Thats okay, though I can still do it. But after college, having a contract meant the navy would pay for my college. I watched so many succeed and receive their contracts. It made me feel bad about myself. I felt I was not good enough, but I knew it was not that I was not good enough. It was. I did not try hard enough come. My senior year, I had my heart broken, fell into a depression which heightened my anxiety. I have never went through that before. It sucked. It took a good months for me to actually start getting better. Here is what I did spoke. I voiced my concerns and worries whether it was something small or something big, like my health. Voicing your feelings, puts them out there and you hear what you are saying, which helps puts things in perspective. Writing, I wrote down everything from how my day went to my constant fears and worries I did this so that I could keep my mind off the physical world and write down what I felt it helpedSo much it helped me keep my mind off the small aches and pains that caused me to worry so much, causing more stress, be active, dont stay in your home. Do not be alone for so long, the mind will wonder and make you feel any, to feel something you do not want. And you will find yourself in a loop. Get outside, go for walks when the sun is out, enjoy your life, spend less time worrying about things that will not happen to you. Spend that time enjoying the good in life. And being a better you. Depression does not dissolve instantly, but taking care of yourself will help you become mentally stronger. If it is bad to the point, you need medication. Take no shame in that youre getting the help you need. And if you need a little boost, then so be it. I hope things get better for you and know there are others out there who are going through it too. Everyone has their own way of coping. God bless

Yes I have been there now I am doing therapy which is really helpful but this has been my the attempt at therapy so a quick disclaimer confusion therapy does not work for everyone and also confusion it might not work at first in I pretty much hit rock bottom and kept asking myself with happened to the last or years of my life I am not going to go into the details of that sudden realization because it hurts and because it is not really going to help you but what I am going to say is mourning the past is a burden and projecting too much for the future can also be a burden you should do stuff because doing things rather than sitting on the couch holding a phone will make you actually feel good strive to do things that make tou feel good and not because you have the obligation to have the career or sometimes we are led to believe that some strives are genuinely ours but they are just expectations based on how we want to be looked at bow social media sucksconfusion try to be in a headspace where you are not squeezed between the burdens of expectations and idealized views of yourself. That way youl be allowed to breath and feel like living is a choice rather than a demand youre allowed to be happy I know this is easier said than done but this is what I have been trying to do it is not a linearPath. And that is ok too.

I struggle with this too. I am self diagnosed adhd and working on getting an official diagnosis. Depression and anxiety often go hand in hand with adhd. Also one week into wellbutrin, which should help my adhd as well as depression. You re not alone in this.

Hey, so I had the same issues my whole life and never understood it. I am very greatful. My husband was understanding, even though I had no excuse for why I did not do this or that, and nothing in the world worked, not reminders, not giving myself rewards, not list making, not alarms, nothing except when it inconvenienced someone else I finally found out at I have adhd. I was misdiagnosed as having ptsd due to my traumatic childhood and diagnosed with anxiety before that. When the issue was much broader. My chronic anxiety, depression and worst symptoms just went poof when I started meds. I say this because the way you are describing it sounds like adhd executive dysfunction, and it is one of the hallmark traits associated with adhd. The difference between executive dysfunction and being lazy is the desire to do the thing and hating yourself for not doing it yet, still being paralyzed. To do. So, I also have an anxiety disorder, comorbidity with adhdconfusion and depression since I was. But of course, I was dissregardedconfusion. And depression is more common in people with adhd. I really got the shit end of the stick. I have all but symptoms. I do not do risk taking behavior, at least not classical random stuff. I do work with venomous snakes and agressive dogs. But im paranoid in precautions with those jobsconfusion, and I dont have the mood regulation issues. And thank god, because those ruined my families lives, and mine by associationconfusion andAbout of them are severe, and I have combination adhd between of the typesconfusion. So I really lucked out, ok, it was actually a video describing executive dysfunction that I could never put into words that lead me to seeking a diagnosis. Some of my symptoms are time blindness, short term memory loss things slip my mindconfusion. I am awful with names, I think in eg, I am great if I have a model in my head. But math, aside from geometry and statisticsconfusion and writing are awful bad word recollection. My brain will freeze up if I cannot remember a word, and basically my whole brain blue screens and has to reboot while I go, uh oh sorry, hold on, sorry, I am chronically disorganized. I forget to eat. I forget to go to the bathroom until I am in pain. I do not feel hungry or thirsty, like I should. I have insomnia and struggle to turn my brain off at night as it is constantly pumping out random thoughts to produce dopamine, which I am lackingconfusion. I have a lot of body pain joint, muscle jawconfusion. Due to micro twitching, as even asleep, my body is seeking stimulation. I stim in the form of lip biting, nail biting, head scratching, picking at the skin around my nails leg, bobbing, singing, I talk too much or too little. I have a short social meter. I fixate on food or hobbies for short periods. And the second, the dopamine is gone and drop them. ICan get things done fast and efficiently of its for someone else, but not for me, about, of kids are diagnosed, and they say, like of adults have adhd. But people are persistently misdiagnosed with anxiety, with depression, with trauma, with bi polar disorder, etc. Etcconfusion. Because its not super well understood past lack of bloodflow to the frontal cortex and dopamine deficiency. Dopamine is the gasoline that runs your brain. Without dopamine youd just let yourself dieconfusion. People learn to hide it as they get older. Or the stereotypical symptoms, like hyperactivity tone down with age. But most symptoms do not get better without diagnosis, finding methods that work for you, like body doublingconfusion and or medication. But while the medication helps, it just sort of gives you the power to work around and or with your symptoms except anxiety and depression. It pretty much got rid of those entirely and or allowed me enough control over my own life to do something about the things that were causing themconfusion. I went from useless and helpless and overwhelmed by making one call in a month in early november to working for myself and making more than I did at my old job found health insurance for me and my husband. I ve never had health insurance beforeconfusion. Did everything involved in us, moving from finding a place to reading and signing the lease husband agreed. He would only help move large pieces of furniture. I have done everything else myself got a dog which isWhy we moved. I finally am changing my last name to my husband.

I was frustrated for a few days, but I had things to do, so I just did them. I do need a holliday. But like I am okay. Mentally and emotionally, I have not had a lazy day where I had things to do or did nothing. Since the start of december, a couple of days. I did not do much, but even when I am like I so exhausted, I am going to just rest today. I ended up spending it researching for my buisness or working on paperwork or something, not because I had to, but I was able to

Hi. I started prozac a couple weeks ago. I actually tolerated it really well, as compared to zoloft, but did have some side effects. I experienced dizziness, usually at nightconfusion, occasional hot flashes and night sweats and memory impairment, brain fog. I found that I actually regained my appetite as my anxiety calmed down, and so did my stomach. Notably, none of my side effects were very severe. The night sweats were not drenching, and the dizziness only happened like once a night. I also tried drinking alcohol after weeks do not recommend it. Lol made me very nauseous and feverish that been the only major downside for me.

Maybe you could use this time to get to know yourself, and what you would like to strive for in the future, a good place to start is by listing down your core values. You can use this to pick your top. You can then identify a goal for yourself, one that speaks to you on a deep level and is in line with the values that you hold dear. If you are willing to commit, you can then create a step by step plan to reach your goal. It very important that your plan is realistic and divided into small, achievable objectives. So you keep motivated. Obviously, this is just a piece of friendly advice, and you can do whatever you want with your free time. This is just something for you to think about hope. This helps

I found that working out was a huge lifesaver, even in a terrible mood. Logically, I knew that it was a positive to do no matter how badly I felt. Things that take physical interaction in general helped. Since my anxiety and depression comes from health and fear of health problems. In the meantime, I would keep searching for work. It has been mind saving for me. Ive honestly considered a second job since work does so well, keeping my mind off of things. Instead of worries about health, I spend all day worrying about things like gas, how much I made that day, next destination, etc.

Exercise, find a hobby, start a small side hustle for extra money, get a dog, go for walks, hikes, volunteer services, or help family and friends.

I knew it was bad, so I did not tell my mom, I do not remember the memory for sure, but now I am worried. What if he was not comfortable? I knew it was wrong, right? So what if I am a creep? Help.

You cannot hold yourself to same standards as a young child as you would now you did nothing wrong and are not a creep. It was normal, curious behavior for children that age.

Title: Why not make now alright too
Thread
Everything ends up being okay in the end, everything in the past is not with us right now. Whats happening now can be a lot may even feel like too much, maybe tomorrow or two days from now, it will not be such a big deal. The shittiness of right now will not really be around. Then its sort of temporary and weightless. The weight will eventually leave the chest, and the comfort of the breath will return. It always happens every time. Eventually it will be alright. So why not make right now alright, too.

I wish I could agree each day, I regret choices I made in the past, and I am only day after day feels the same. I only come to peace in the evening when I know there is nothing to be achieved. And during the night, when I am asleep, the things I am struggling with today are the things I struggled with two days ago, and two days ago, I struggled with the things that worried me. Days ago. This is going on for weeks and months. Now, everytime I try to find a solution for this, all I get as an answer is you are depressed as if I did not know that already I am in therapy, I take medication, but none of it helps to overcome the desire to just run away from everything that is troubling me right now, all the things I enjoyed before feel pointless, compared to the feeling of being a failure, of constantly making and having made bad decisions, not putting in enough effort and just not knowing where to head from. Now, the things people tell me I am supposed to do feel like a never ending circle. Each day, it is the same. Get a job, get your driver license back, clean your room, answer the phone. I do not want to be ungrateful, but my life feels like every single day is just a slight variation of yesterday. I dream of going places, dream of visiting the world, only to find myself even strugglingTo go outside, because I just have no drive at all. Soon as I wake up, all I am waiting for is to sleep again. It the darkness of night, I find most comfort in the sound of rain and storm outside, thinking of easier times and losing myself in visions of what I will never be, only to distract myself from what I am.

I knew a girl who had a horrible life, just the worst problems and all the time, some her fault and some just fluke, she would just cry and complain. And after she would be happy and say, everything will work out, it always does. Seeing her face such hardcore adversity and be cool with it, because she knew it would eventually be ok, always blew my mind. I try to remind myself of that when I face challenges.

Indeed, if it is going to fade away anyway, why not fade it sooner? Also, contrarily, if you are worrying too much, but the situation is actually a few days away. Why not postpone the worry for an hour or two and stop worrying for a while you re anyway, going to worry solve the problem later? So might as well do it all together rather than spoiling the next few hours.

Yes, you can. Your body already produces melatonin. Naturally, you shouldnt have a problem. Melatonin with anti anxiety, meds will have no interaction. Melatonin with antidepressants might just increase the sedation drowsiness effect thats about it.

Same. Most people would be out partying and hanging with friends. My anxiety is so bad I have come to terms I may never have a normal life or social life again. I just lay on the couch all day bored out of my mind, just watching youtube videos and browsing the internet to get the day over with only to repeat the process again the next day, hoping some day I will be able to live a happy life again.

Yes I have been there now I am doing therapy which is really helpful but this has been my the attempt at therapy so a quick disclaimer confusion therapy does not work for everyone and also confusion it might not work at first in I pretty much hit rock bottom and kept asking myself with happened to the last or years of my life I am not going to go into the details of that sudden realization because it hurts and because it is not really going to help you but what I am going to say is mourning the past is a burden and projecting too much for the future can also be a burden you should do stuff because doing things rather than sitting on the couch holding a phone will make you actually feel good strive to do things that make tou feel good and not because you have the obligation to have the career or sometimes we are led to believe that some strives are genuinely ours but they are just expectations based on how we want to be looked at bow social media sucksconfusion try to be in a headspace where you are not squeezed between the burdens of expectations and idealized views of yourself. That way youl be allowed to breath and feel like living is a choice rather than a demand youre allowed to be happy I know this is easier said than done but this is what I have been trying to do it is not a linearPath. And that is ok too.

Hey, so I had the same issues my whole life and never understood it. I am very greatful. My husband was understanding, even though I had no excuse for why I did not do this or that, and nothing in the world worked, not reminders, not giving myself rewards, not list making, not alarms, nothing except when it inconvenienced someone else I finally found out at I have adhd. I was misdiagnosed as having ptsd due to my traumatic childhood and diagnosed with anxiety before that. When the issue was much broader. My chronic anxiety, depression and worst symptoms just went poof when I started meds. I say this because the way you are describing it sounds like adhd executive dysfunction, and it is one of the hallmark traits associated with adhd. The difference between executive dysfunction and being lazy is the desire to do the thing and hating yourself for not doing it yet, still being paralyzed. To do. So, I also have an anxiety disorder, comorbidity with adhdconfusion and depression since I was. But of course, I was dissregardedconfusion. And depression is more common in people with adhd. I really got the shit end of the stick. I have all but symptoms. I do not do risk taking behavior, at least not classical random stuff. I do work with venomous snakes and agressive dogs. But im paranoid in precautions with those jobsconfusion, and I dont have the mood regulation issues. And thank god, because those ruined my families lives, and mine by associationconfusion andAbout of them are severe, and I have combination adhd between of the typesconfusion. So I really lucked out, ok, it was actually a video describing executive dysfunction that I could never put into words that lead me to seeking a diagnosis. Some of my symptoms are time blindness, short term memory loss things slip my mindconfusion. I am awful with names, I think in eg, I am great if I have a model in my head. But math, aside from geometry and statisticsconfusion and writing are awful bad word recollection. My brain will freeze up if I cannot remember a word, and basically my whole brain blue screens and has to reboot while I go, uh oh sorry, hold on, sorry, I am chronically disorganized. I forget to eat. I forget to go to the bathroom until I am in pain. I do not feel hungry or thirsty, like I should. I have insomnia and struggle to turn my brain off at night as it is constantly pumping out random thoughts to produce dopamine, which I am lackingconfusion. I have a lot of body pain joint, muscle jawconfusion. Due to micro twitching, as even asleep, my body is seeking stimulation. I stim in the form of lip biting, nail biting, head scratching, picking at the skin around my nails leg, bobbing, singing, I talk too much or too little. I have a short social meter. I fixate on food or hobbies for short periods. And the second, the dopamine is gone and drop them. ICan get things done fast and efficiently of its for someone else, but not for me, about, of kids are diagnosed, and they say, like of adults have adhd. But people are persistently misdiagnosed with anxiety, with depression, with trauma, with bi polar disorder, etc. Etcconfusion. Because its not super well understood past lack of bloodflow to the frontal cortex and dopamine deficiency. Dopamine is the gasoline that runs your brain. Without dopamine youd just let yourself dieconfusion. People learn to hide it as they get older. Or the stereotypical symptoms, like hyperactivity tone down with age. But most symptoms do not get better without diagnosis, finding methods that work for you, like body doublingconfusion and or medication. But while the medication helps, it just sort of gives you the power to work around and or with your symptoms except anxiety and depression. It pretty much got rid of those entirely and or allowed me enough control over my own life to do something about the things that were causing themconfusion. I went from useless and helpless and overwhelmed by making one call in a month in early november to working for myself and making more than I did at my old job found health insurance for me and my husband. I ve never had health insurance beforeconfusion. Did everything involved in us, moving from finding a place to reading and signing the lease husband agreed. He would only help move large pieces of furniture. I have done everything else myself got a dog which isWhy we moved. I finally am changing my last name to my husband. After years married, I am healthier than I have been in years. I am the do for and i, for the first time, ever, pushed through a mental breakdown and just kept going.

I did not do much, but even when I am like I so exhausted, I am going to just rest today.

Most meds need a few weeks to kick in properly so your body can adjust and side effects can diminish.

Title: Buspar side effects.
Thread
Has anyone taken buspar for anxiety? I have taken three other medications before this, and none of them worked. So my doctor prescribed me buspar. The main thing I am dealing with is pretty bad nausea. Every time I take it all, I feel like doing is laying in bed after I do, please tell me your experiences good or bad.

Now that I have no job, I find myself just sitting on my phone, mindlessly scrolling all day, not even making the most of my free time, just wasting every day nothing at all that I can think of that I want to do.

I find doing something productive and positive. Go for a walk. Tidy, clean your home, do something creative, maybe drawing or art, self care, face mask, moisturise. Take a moment to appreciate simple things. Seeing a bird outside the window, really slowing down. And being grateful for anything, even something really small, it a good place to start every morning, I make my bed. This is a tiny accomplishment that starts me off for the day with something positive under my belt.

I would not worry about it unless your boss challenges you about it easier said than done, I know. But you have done everything by the book and have nothing to feel bad about edit, talk to your therapist about it too.

For me, the best way I handle phone calls is by remembering that we are all human and most likely the person on the other end will not judge you. A thing you can do is practice the phone call and even write things down. If they do ask things you are not prepared for. Remember, you can say I am not sure or I will look it up. I hope everything goes well for you talking on the phone can be hard, but once it over, it feels so much better red heart

Title: Anxiety disorder focused on suffocating.
Thread
Last week, I was smoking greens with friends and suddenly got a panic attack. It felt as I would suffocate any moment since then, I am feeling much more anxious and constantly monitoring my breath. I am on sri medication, mid size, doseconfusion, and was doing really good for the past few months. Furthermore, the breaking difficulties is how original my anxiety came about when I was fifteen. Amp now I took a strong hit. I am really down. I am back to constantly thinking about my breathing. My anxiety level is constantly high throughout the day. I do know that it tends to stabilise in the days following panic attack. It been three days since the attackconfusion. However, I want to get it under control. I am in the vicious cycle where, when I do not think about breathing, I am anxious and afraid I will suffocate. But once I start controlling my breathing, I think about it even more, and it get more stressful. When I leave my house, I am already on full alert mode right now. And the fear of next panic attack is obviously all the time around. I have a lot of work at the uni girlfriend and feel really overwhelmed by the whole situation. I have to get it under control. Amp do you have any suggestions how to cope with it? I am already on the mid size dose of sri plan to visit my psychiatrist soon and want to make an appointment to the psychologist. Furthermore, iAm now back to breathing excercises and hope it will help. However, this overwhelming fear of suffocating is all around me. I would be very thankful for sharing your past experience and tips. Amp I do have asthma and take medication. Hence my breathing is perfectly normal before the panic attack last few months, were really calm, the anxiety was present, but under control. In previous years, it used to get nuts, but hope to never go back there again.
Comments
I have been here before and have not experienced it in years. So you had a panic attack from smoking. You were worried about breathing, which is why you continue to fixate. Now you feel like you have to manually breathe instead of it feeling automatic. First, it is impossible to suffocate in this manner. Go ahead, hold your breath as long as you can. You always go to breathe. If you are distracted, you will also notice you will breathe without issue whenever it is occurring, and you are scared. Just remind yourself you will not die, it will just be uncomfortable. So the main problem is this is where your mind goes when you feel anxious. So when it happens, remind yourself it is just a symptom of anxiety. And distract yourself by focusing on something else early on, you will have to do this routine a lot

Title: Having struggles with art related anxiety.
Thread
I love painting, and I have had a few years where I got into the rhythm of painting and was comfortable with it. I have art from those years I look back on that make me happy, even if the art is not good. When I was learning and figuring it out when I go for a long time not painting, I get anxiety about trying again. And in recent months, when I try to paint, I do not know what I am doing due to being out of practice and I lose any motivation to continue when the painting goes badly this winter. I have wanted to try to make some new paintings, but go through this problem where I spend all this time trying to prep myself up for it. I clean my desk and set up a work station. All the paints, ready, references up and ready on the laptop. Then I sit down and start panicking. I sweat, my head spins, heart races, and I feel like crying. It is so annoying, and I hate this is definitely the biggest hurdle, and without fail, it always comes back. Even when I was comfortable. While painting, I still had some moderate anxiety during the process, there is one painting I have made about ten years ago, and I never forget how at ease I felt at that time I wish I could re experience that relaxed confidence I felt then dae know how to get over this hurdle. I hear all the timeJust do it nikeconfusion he of course I get that and I do try to push through it but the anxiety does not really go away while I am painting lately though it is been very hard are there other tips you have for chilling out and getting over the performance anxiety
Comments
You could try making art using a different medium. Keeping a notepad and pen by you, and doodling could maybe help you relax. As corny as it may sound, you could also incorporate your anxiety into your art. You sit down and feel anxious. How does that feeling? Look on paper? You could also paint a picture with the intent of it not looking good. Do a messy painting or even finger painting.

Oh yeah, I go through this too sometimes the anxiety can have me so high strung and hyper vigilant that it is exhausting and I feel like the depressive period comes when I am totally depleted of energy it takes a certain amount of fuel to be running that much anxiety on the system so there is a slump when it all finally burns off. I am really not sure what the solution for it would. Beim so sorry you are dealing with that.

Absolutely I can never seem to remember that these things cycle when I am in the low mood phase, I was completely jacked up with anxiety for like days last week and then yesterday and today it gave way to a complete depressive abyss. Maybe it is hormonal. It could also just be the natural progression of those kinds of thought patterns I wish I could offer help, but I am insanely unskillful at recognizing what is going on or interrupting the pattern in any way.

Title: Work makes me incredibly scared and depressed.

Its happening again. I have got a new task at work, and I have no idea how to do it. Usually, I get anxious and think, how am I going to get through this? But this time, I actually feel defeated. I actually feel myself have given up, and I do not know what to do. I am sitting here wanting to cry. I can see it when I look in the mirror. I look so drowned by work that it hurts my heart. It would not make me feel so bad if I had some help to go to with my questions. But really, it feels like I am being left to drown. I really want to go home, crawl in bed, and not have to deal with the world for a couple weeks. I am genuinely scared of what is going to happen when my manager checks how my assignment is coming along, and I will be struggling to show them any ounce of progress. I feel like a failure. I got an engineering degree just to come work and realize I suck at it. I am so scared that I will not get better at it. And then I do not know what I will do

Title: Social anxiety been getting the best of me a series of not so great events.
Thread
Hello, everyone. I am a year old girl currently at my and year of university. I study something that is not my cup of tea, but due to pressure from parents to do seth. I went along with it, went there totally unprepared with zero knowledge of everyone else was just a bunch of experts. No, like, literally, yo, pal! With tons of experience and academic background are my classmates in this bachelor degree. I struggled like crazy due to being in my first year and drowning into the ocean alone. It all started during the it lockdown, barely passing barely any recognition of my work, just pure hectic life. On top of that, I had just broken up from my year long distance relationship with a guy. I really wanted it to work. As you may understand, it was difficult, af to move on to this new reality while carrying a heartbreak at the same time, a while before I left my country of origin to go study abroad. My high school philosophy teacher and I had become best friends, and she was like a second parent. To me, we had common interests, always something there to discuss. It felt so comforting. Knowing that someone is there to listen. I had friends, my age, too, at the time whom we would vibe with. Kid you not guys fast forward to lockdown. Everybody vanished for no reason. Without any closure, nothing just never spoke to me again. It was almost literally like a domino effect. OneAfter the other. There was never a fight or a misunderstanding causing this. Still, I have no closure. I was alone all summer, and im the introverted type of person, so this was not something new that made me sad or I could not stand it. I been a loner all my life, but at some point it really did start becoming lonely. I am not blaming anyone I am wishing well for all. And then I think to myself, nobody owes me nothing, not even a closure. They felt like cutting me off. Cuz they simply felt like it cool. So be it hurt me. But I did not dwell on it obsessively I have not had intercourse with anyone yet virgin at. And this is something that was messing up my confidence. Everybody around me started fucking sleeping around. Cuz it was fun or even started a family. And here I am not being able to say. I know what any of this feels. I just never felt the need to rush it unless I could trust and vibe with the other person. So many people I had met never really clicked with me to say yes. Now I feel ready to take it a step further with you. It just never felt right to me, giving something so intimate of mine to someone who, after me, is going to do it with anyone else regardless. Lol, so I wait. The events that took place with my friends and my exes in the pastHave made me incredibly closed off yes, I would enjoy my own company and stuff but now it has become too much I do not have a single friend im in my shell and I find it impossible to trust deleted majority of my insta followers. Cuz in reality I did not have a single true friend to go out for a coffee with and I know things have gotten worse when I can barely get out of bed and attend lectures in person or present a project or walk on the massive hallways full of people without crying or getting massive anxiety even going out has become a courageous act. Lol university been stressing me out like crazy. My mental health has been deteriorating and everyone seems to be in a constant meh cannot relate state no one to talk to nowhere to vent. So here I am. Thank you for hearing me out

You have a lot going on. But what is interesting is how you view everything. It quite distorted by anxiety. The anxious brain likes to plan and hates uncertainty. It compares to others. Truthfully, you are in the same boat as most people. You lack confidence and seem to be experiencing imposter syndrome at school. They re older, so what? They re probably all jealous of you for having your youth and a large head start in your field. Either way, these feelings are normal and a large percentage of students experience it at college. Most of these people were some of the smartest in their highschool. Now they are surrounded by other people from similar circumstances and feel less special. Schoolwork is harder and more specific, so it is harder for people to coast like they used to. Using their intelligence, as opposed to hard work. There is no right time to lose your virginity or start a serious relationship. You are just feeling pressure because you are finding it hard to compare yourself to others. You realistically just want to feel like you are on the right track. But this is not a videogame that plays music or has strategic loot to reinforce you are going the right way. Now, the time you are actually figuring yourself out, high school is being surrounded by people who just happen to live near you. Now, the world is open to you, and it is a little overwhelming. Just take your time and experiment. Put yourself outThere like a bazillion people at your school. Some one does not like you who cares? But every conversation is an opportunity to meet someone cool. All you need to do is avoid big fuck ups. And that is easy. Failing tests, get a tutor symptoms, overwhelming, utilize therapy services lonely, join a group. The secret is everyone at school is lonely and desperate to make friends everyone. No one has ever said I have too many friends.

I get too many panic attacks for no reason.
Comments
If you need to take a break for your health, do it, but I think it is important to explore the anxiety more. I do not think you are having panic attacks for no reason. I am not sure of your situation, or if you are receiving treatment. But you need to understand your anxiety. If you want to overcome it as uncomfortable as it is, you need to ask yourself questions about the anxiety. Is it caused by work? Is it worse at work? Does it happen during the same time each day or after you do something or have a specific thought? Is it background anxiety? In that no specific thoughts bother you? Or do you have intrusive thoughts that make you feel like you have no control? Is it mostly physical? Do the physical symptoms make you worry even more? Etc. These questions help you make a plan, identify what you need to work on therapy, and or meds are wonderful. Anxiety has a natural and useful function. Yours is just ringing alarm bells for something. Find out what it is.

Title: Just quit antidepressants looking for a natural supplement to help with nervousness anxiety.
Thread
I have stopped taking antidepressants completely a week ago after tapering down for months. I am doing ok, but I do take a small dose of beta blockers when I have to go to work, because it is quite intense. After years of therapy, I started taking antidepressants to help with my hypersensitivity and panic attacks. It helped tremendously, but I really dislike the side effects, so after about years, I decided to quit. I am starting cut next week, but I am also looking into a natural supplement to ease my mind. Il try to describe how I feel. I am very aware of my surroundings and am constantly feeling on edge when I am alone. I am fine, besides a worrying, racing, mindconfusion, but not outside or around people. Its not really a social thing. I am an introvert, but function perfectly fine in conversation and work. I am very bad with confrontation, though its more an overall hypersensitivity to noticing everything when I am in public. Its like antidepressants gave me the filter I needed no longer noticing everything, and just feeling more relaxed. Does anyone know a natural supplement that can help mic this
Comments
Cut should be extremely helpful for what you have explained. Of course, there are supplements like it, john wort, which are said to have pro mental health properties. You are essentially trading one pill for one that just is not as effective if you want to go the healthy or non medication route, I would look into mindfulness and meditation. It proven to be effective in reducing anxiety by allowing you to tap into a relaxed state, have more control over thoughts and focus, and allow you to process things in beneficial way.

My anxiety is so weird. All day long at work, I am calm and confident. Going through meetings dealing with clients, solving problems, nothing can unphase me. Whem! I am in the zone.

Title: Anxiety interfering with my work.

I have never been officially diagnosed with anxiety but my therapist thinks I have it. I started going to therapy for the first time a few months ago because I was too stressed to eat or sleep, and it was interfering with my work including affecting my productivity and memory therapy has been helping somewhat. But every two weeks or so I spiral into an anxious mess and can barely function for several days in a row. The past two weeks have been the worst I have been panicking about things that are not important and making rushed decisions out of fear that come back to bite me. I ended up taking two days off as mental health days because I literally could not sleep and could not concentrate at work the day after I had an appointment with my therapist and she gave me some new techniques to try and those help, but now I am spiraling again, and I do not know what to do. I scheduled an appointment with my primary care provider for friday to maybe try to get an official diagnosis or medication. But then I felt guilty that I have missed so much work lately between mental health days and therapy sessionsconfusion. So I canceled it. I do not know what to do. This is affecting my work, and I am scared that it is just going to continue getting more unmanageable, and I am sure my supervisor or coworkers can guess that something is up. I know I amActing weird, but I cannot talk about it for fear there will be stigma about it. So I am stuck trying to function as best as I can while pretending everything is fine.

Title: Alcohol and anxiety.
Thread
Hello everyone. I was wondering if anyone has any experience with alcohol triggering their anxiety, but not while drinking. But a day or two later, I stopped drinking about months ago, for a good reason. I was never drinking in moderation, and it became an everyday thing that I lost control over. I noticed my depression and anxiety were out of control while drinking like that. I was drinking heavily for a few years to be honestconfusion, and considered the alcohol to be playing a huge role in that. On sunday, however, I decided to have some wine and champagne for a valentines day, and I got a nice buzz, spent all of monday in bed and hung over with a little anxiety creeping in, but nothing too bad today, however, I had two full blown anxiety attacks that seemingly came out of nowhere, completely unsure of any trigger. I was wondering if this could potentially be from drinking, or maybe my anxiety is just on one today. Thank you for any input in advance. Also, if anyone has anything that works for them to help soothe and calm them down, please feel free to share red heart

Alcohol dehydrated you badly. Thats what hangovers are from. When you are dehydrated, you will suffer from an increased heart rate, dry mouth, shaking, racing thoughts, etc. The hangover itself is the trigger.

I had depression a few months back and anxiety as well. Thankfully, it got better. Seasonal depression is no joke. Youre not broken either. Just like depression, there is no cure for anxiety, its not really a bad thing either. Its our minds defense mechanism. Same with depression, everyone has anxiety, it just does not show the same as your case or even mine. Thats fine. The goal with anxiety is managing it no cure, just simply knowing when something is a threat, versus when something is not a threat, it takes time. But I promise youre not crazy. People with heightened anxiety just need a tune up that can be done a number of ways with or without medication. I took the no medication route, make sure you talk to people get your concerns out there. It helps so much voicing the concerns have a journal. I downloaded an app on my ipad. It was a digital journal where I can type. Instead, write. It helped a lot, writing everything I felt and how day went. Every journal was different. I could see my mood gradually change, going back to my old self. Develop a routine. Go to sleep early, wake up, work out, eat and eat healthy. Just know when you have anxiety attacks, you will feel weird. It takes a lot of energy, it will make you tired. Itll cause tingling feeling in your face and hands, cause your ears to ring, make you focus on pains and aches that end up beingNothing. One of my biggest things I cannot recommend enough. Stay off google. Dont self diagnose yourself. Please do not dont think that your anxiety is linked to a mental illness.

Title: My teeth are one of biggest cause of my anxiety. I just want to die.

Since I was little, I have problems with teeth so many fillings, some of them redone many times. I am in pain, so I had it scan done, and my teeth with root canals, I didnt even have money to get them crownedconfusion, and now they say all are inflamed and need to be redone again. Plus crowns on each tooth. Also, my front teeth are getting crooked and crowded, so I will need veneers or crowns too. I wasnt able to have braces because of so much pain. I also have missing tooth, which needs implant and gum graft. I am so anxious. My teeth hurt every day, they are sensitive. Sometimes I feel like they all hurt. I brush floss. I have dental hygiene. Once a year, I use remineralization gel. Still, I have new cavities under fillings. Why me frown, sad, angry or pouting so many problems in my life. I also filed my lower teeth because I was desperate after I wasnt able to have braces had bonding done. And since then, I cant use to new shape. It feels weird. But dentist said, its ok. I clench teeth and push tongue into lower ones. I cant stop. I am so over this I need minimum to repair my mouth. And what about future? I need thousands for other problems, too. My story is too long. I am so tired of this life, so very tired I am on lexapro. But I think of suicide again. I cant imagine to have prosthetic,Teeth or to live with those teeth I have.

Gosh, I was just thinking about how much issues I have with my teeth too. It sucks to have teeth issues. And god, it is so expensive to get any little procedure. The smell of the dentist room really just fills me with anxiety.

Hey, op! I completely feel for you and have been in a similar situation. I have an autoimmune condition that affected my natural teeth, and no matter how much I looked after them had a good diet, and went to the dentist ended up getting multiple cavities, reoccurring infections, and generally made my life hell. Due to my illness. Eating away at the enamel most days, I would be in pain, or at least some mild discomfort. Eating was no longer enjoyable, and just a chore they gave me crippling anxiety and depression. I would totally avoid smiling, laughing, social situations and relationships, because I was simply ashamed of them. Looking back, it was not that noticeable, but to me, I was constantly paranoid of the look of them, the potential of bad breath. And generally, anyone seeing my teeth, it was so disheartening, just watching them deteriorate, no matter what I tried, and eventually just developed a fuck it mentality towards them, and kind of accepted, I was always going to have bad teeth. After years or pain abbesses, and being completely miserable, I decided I would had enough and got all of them ripped out and started fresh with implants. Its honestly the best decision I have ever made in my life. I enjoy eating again. I smile, laugh and feel healthy and confident. They look completely natural, too. As I did not go for the luminous hollywood bright, white, and asked my dentist to shape them straight, but not that perfect. They lookFalse. Nobody even knows. I have a complete set of fake teeth. They feel like my own teeth too. Now in my country, they would have cost me around. I went to turkey and was treated amazingly and got the same quality of work done for less than half the price at just over. I know it is still an awful lot of money, but having a good set of teeth is honestly priceless and completely worth saving for. If you can do, I was terrified of the procedure, but all I felt was the initial discomfort of the anaesthetic and some mild pain for a couple of weeks after its completely safe, and people dying or getting severely hurt in a dentist chair is unheard of. If it is a possibility for you. I would highly recommend, considering the same treatment feel free to me if you would like to know more about the treatment, how things have changed, or if you just want a chat. Either way, I hope that you somehow get to a stage where you no longer have problems with your teeth. As I fully understand what it can do to a persons mental health and quality of life.

Me, too. I just had to go to dentist last monday, trying to schedule an appointment since december. My teeth are also becoming crooked. I have two root canals, one broke last december, but I could not fix since I decided to pay to fill a cavity that suddenly appeared on the canine tooth. And the dentist said, I have other cavities, at least, and possibly I need another one. If not two root canals done. And wisdom teeth pushing my lower teeth that I need to remove it damn expensive. I cannot save money because I need to spend on countless cavities that shows does not matter how good is my toothbrush or my mouth wash or my dental floss and how many times I brush my teeth. It so tiresome makes me have an extremely low self esteem. I do not smile. When I take pictures, I have to use benzo if I do not want to have a panic attack on the dentist chair. My teeth are so sensitive, and I felt like crying last monday, even if it all lasted only min. I know how you feel. I know it is tiresome, but do not let it define you focus whatever energy left on something you like, keep going one day at time, one step a day a week, but keep going. It hurts. But I tell it to myself that I will focus on things that make me happy. And those things, even if just for a fleeting moment make meHave hope about the future. We need to have hope that everything will be alright. Don give up. You re stronger than anything that life throws your way. Keep fighting cry if you need to scream into a pillow. But keep going. You re beautiful inside and out. Believe in it. Sending your way all the strength and resilience one can have, sending you good vibes and hope you re strong. I believe in you.

I would recommend getting a second opinion. First off veneers for crowding is not a solution. It is a bandaid for aesthetics. Its possible you have infection in your gums or sinuses. If all teeth have failed root canals, they may not have failed at allconfusion. Go see another dentist and see if there is any way you can get braces of any type. Maybe even plastic tray braces. Dental pain sucks and grates at you, but it is no reason to end your life. There are solutions, and in time, it does get better. I had all this as a younger adult, and years later, my teeth are healthy and as strong as they can be small things. To rectify your dental health overall, I would recommend getting a higher end electric toothbrush spend confusion and use it twice a day, floss daily, use those flossing picks. I find them easiestconfusion pick up a fluoride, toothpaste, like president or a fluoride mouthwash to use daily. All of this will prevent things from getting worse than they are then pick away at it little by little, with the necessities first, you might be able to find a dentist who will do a cash rate if you do not have insurance or a dental school that offers discounted work. Cod oil if it is legal where you live, could help with some of the anxiety as well. Sending so much love and hope your way it gets better.

My anxiety is so weird. All day long at work, I am calm and confident. Going through meetings dealing with clients, solving problems, nothing can unphase me. Whem! I am in the zone. But the moment I get back home, I start to feel my anxiety in my whole body. Muscular pain, headache, tiredness. I feel overwhelmed when I stop it, like there is two version of me a lion and a mouse. When I am doing my job, I feel confident and so sure of myself. When I get off work, the little mouse comes out, and I feel like a fraud. Like nothing I do is right the orchestra of my anxious thoughts circle in my head again and again.

Title: Pretty bad existential crisis.

Right now, I have pretty bad existential crisis since this beginning of the month. I am, but right now is not looking great right now, I feel like I wasted some time. I feel scare about my death, my siblings or parents death, like, what happen after death? I am starting to realize that time is irreplaceable. Also, reading about dementia and alzheimer's was not a great read because my mom still in her, but scared she will lose to dementia, and I see her die and slowly forget about me. Death is scary. But thinking about becoming an adult in years and going to college is going to scare me. Death is also scary.
Comments
Adult life is fun, man with some downsides, and your fear of death is understandable. I am. I still have those fears here and there, and I end up thinking as far what you thought losing the most important person in my life my mother, I feel your pain. If it makes you feel better, youre not alone with those thoughts. In fact, people our age think about death a lot and even fear it. But as we get older, we are more accepting of it no longer scares us. It just happens. Death is apart of life. Now I cannot speak on the dementia and alzheimer's part, but I want you to know that your fears are understandable. Those are very serious conditions. Talk to your mom about your fears. Man as old as I am, I still talk to my mom, whos is also in her early. My moms my best friend,

I was actually proud of myself for actually making it through and being able to actually speak and say things not exactly the right thingsconfusion. I could tell I was not saying the things I wanted to say, but I kept going the hardest part is that I am so passionate about dentistry, and I have put in so much time and effort into it, and each time I get told you are not good enough, its so hard to be seen the way you want to be seen. But I guess I was not able to get that across. I have been told by people that I do not deserve to be one. And today I actually believe it. I got my interview rejection, and I have spent most of the day crying, just noticed this went way of topic I am sorry. I have battled with crippling anxiety and depression these past few years, and it has not made any of this easy. I have a really awful home life, which is another problem in itself.

I completely disagree that you do not deserve to be a dentist. And I am sorry you had such a hard time with the interview process. I really struggle with interviews and do not always say what I want in the right way, too. I think having a dentist or dental hygienist who can relate to dental anxiety in general would be such an amazing asset. I have been going to the same dentist all my life, and they are extremely accommodating to my anxiety and disabilities. They keep the lights lower for me. Let me pick music to play, do not refer to themselves as doctor remove their badges for me. And we go at my pace. I have longer dental appointments so we can take breaks, and they talk me through every little thing. My dentist and dental hygienist both have openly talked to me about having anxiety themselves, and we talk about things we have in common before an appointment, because it helps me relate to them and feel less afraid. A lot of people in my area were seriously harmed by a dentist who used his position to abuse children. Multiple family members and friends of mine have debilitating dental anxiety because of him. He is the kind of person who does not deserve to be a dentist

Throw away because some friends follow my regular account anyways. I hate anxiety, and I could not even tell you the last time I went one single day without feeling like I am going to explode. My head is so constantly full of anxiety driven thoughts that it is hard to even have a conversation with someone lately. I have been starting sentences and then not even being able to finish them, because about halfway through speaking, my brain forgets what I was saying and continues. It is little anxiety war. My friends think it is kind of funny, but I can also tell they are starting to make jokes about it. My roommate texted our group chat the other day and said I would ask op this but they probably will not listen. So im asking the group some days I basically speak like im stoned because I cannot focus on one thought long enough to actually say it. Im so annoyed with myself

Anxiety sucks. Man, are you in college? Definitely talk to a counselor if you can get those thoughts out in words, youre not stupid either. Dont let your friends get to you. Some people do not understand something until it happens to them. Anxiety causes things like brain fog. Dont stress it, though. Once you get back up, you will be good as new, maintain good habits. I promise there is an upside.

I have really negative thoughts about not making money. Its caused me to save about over years, weekend work and over time. And I am now in corporate business, to business sales, and I feel burnt out from the targets and feel I cannot do the job. I didnt start earning proper income until before that. I was university travelling hour back and fourth each way, and then visiting the doctors clinic times a week for my medical treatments. I was not able to earn much. Apart from the holiday casual jobs. I dont know why, but I feel worn out from all the time spent studying, traveling to campus and doctors clinics and not being able to work, to the point where I ended up working a shit tonne to save, because I felt like I had to make up for lost time. And now I am in a career I dont like too much pressure and targets, and I resigned on monday. Anyone else experience this

Title: Anxiety about anaphylaxis.
Thread
I have this irrational fear that I am going to have a severe allergic reaction. I have never actually had any severe allergies, but I am so afraid. For example, today, I wanted to have some broccoli. I have not eaten brocolli in years. I do not know why I just sort of stopped eating it for a while. And now, since I have gone a while without eating it, I am afraid I will have a reaction to it, the same with lots of other foods. I have been tested. But the doctor told me he will only test for wheat, milk, eggs and soy. I know I need to see a doctor for this, but is there any advice for me from anyone who has experienced something similar or who has health anxiety like me?
Comments
I had a small little thing with that fear. It lasted a few hours for some reason. I thought I would be allergic to peanuts, even though I have been eating peanuts for as long as I can remember.

If you sneeze with your mouth closed, boogies will come out all seriousness. You will be fine. Stay off google. Thats your enemy. Those mes where web my says you are going to die because you coughed are exactly what google can do. There are people who sneeze with their eyes open, which do you think is worse? Lol, youre fine, though its okay to sneeze when you have a chest pain after the sneeze, try patting your chest. Sometimes that will resolve the temporary pain, I promise you will not die.

There is a difference between having anxiety and being anxious just like there is a difference between having depression and being depressed anyone can have periods of anxiousness or depression but it becomes chronic when there is no logical cause or reasoning and it is persistent despite this hope that helps.

Title: Never realized how hard finding a good therapist is.

I never once realized how hard finding a good therapist that fully understands your needs is I had a therapist I had to part ways with because she was quite young, and I felt like I was her way of gaining experience. And she had not really had enough experience before me to fully know how to deal with what I am going through. And every office I call is either fully booked or just wayy to expensive. I am years old and I feel like the more days I go on without seeing a therapist, the worse my anxiety gets, and I feel like I am underwater, slowly being pulled down deeper and deeper, and I feel so alone and so scared. And I feel like the moment I do find a therapist or even a psychiatrist I would not even know where to start or what I would even say

Tbe. My favourite therapist, aside from my, of, was my massage therapist. I have tried probably different am therapists in the last years. Most of them let you talk away about your problems while they work on you, and decrease physical stress. Talking with them helps me let out some of the stress about silly scenarios.

Its not cancer. Many of us struggle with this kind of thing. Think about what you just said, your weaning off my of prozac. You have to accept these feelings and tell yourself that it is just your body dealing with anxiety, and then it will get better.

Title: Anxiety about anaphylaxis.
Thread
I have this irrational fear that I am going to have a severe allergic reaction. I have never actually had any severe allergies, but I am so afraid. For example, today, I wanted to have some broccoli. I have not eaten brocolli in years. I do not know why I just sort of stopped eating it for a while. And now, since I have gone a while without eating it, I am afraid I will have a reaction to it, the same with lots of other foods. I have been tested. But the doctor told me he will only test for wheat, milk, eggs and soy. I know I need to see a doctor for this, but is there any advice for me from anyone who has experienced something similar or who has health anxiety like me?
Comments
Here is my experience. I would not call it advice, but maybe you can relate, just know it takes time and work, but it can get better. I have been dealing with anxiety about anaphylaxis for a little over years, never had an allergic reaction to food in my life. But some how my brain developped this irrational fear when I burnt out, it is getting better, but I still hear the little voice in the back of my head everytime I eat something new or that is a common allergen. What if I think this irrational fear comes from my fear of not being in control if I was in a life threatening situation? How would I save myself that? What I keep thinking I need to remind myself that it is ok to be vulnerable it? Ok, not to know what to do. To overcome this, I began by mastering my panic response. Then I started to reintroduce trigger foods gradually, and dealing with the moment of panic that ensued. Now I get minimal panic before and after, but I had to challenge myself to do things that made me scared

If you think you did poorly, instead of asking about the grade, you can email your professor and own the poor performance and ask for advice on how you can be more successful with the rest of the course. This does a few things that I think are important confusion. It helps you redirect your anxiety instead of giving in to it. If you can focus on a plan to make things better, that is a lot more productive, and it is a good habit to build in life in general confusion. It is probably good for your grade anyway, confusion it shows respect for the teacher grade schedule and an earnest interest in the course at the same time. Instead of you just asking for something, your gradeconfusion, your asking for help to bring more to their class. And teachers, typically like that,

I think having a mature conversation with your professor about your anxiety could be helpful if it comes from a place of wanting to improve your performance and not enabling the anxiety. Your professor, realistically, will not get you your grade faster than anyone else in the class, but could give you additional assignments for extra credit. Communicate how you are doing as it is, getting in the way of other work, but know that you cannot change the outcome if you failed the exam. At least for me, I conflate communication with getting what I want. You can do whatever the hell you want, but you are not entitled to them doing anything about it thats pouting

I am plagued by this too. It resulted in tics, actually where whenever an embarrassing memory enters my head, I say some variation of fuck or I going to fucking kill myself under my breath. I am not as bothered psychologically by them anymore, but the tics still happen. It happens several times a day. I just tried to remind myself that everyone is embarrassing. And of the time, people do not notice or forget about it, I do not know how to make the thoughts stop, but I just forced myself to become ok with them. It was not easy and it did not happen overnight. It tough, but I know you can get there someday.

Hello there. I have to admit, I am quite embarrassed to admit this to anyone. I am a year old boy, and I just do not find any other guys my age, having these problems. I work at a nice restaurant. It is not stressful, and for the most part, it is quite fun. But whenever I am away from work, I have severe anxiety about it. I even have anxiety attacks right now. I am off sick, and although I am sick, I am definitely playing it up to avoid going to work. I have been asked to cover three shifts from different people, and I agreed for the weekend, but I am having anxiety attacks over them. I know that I cannot stay off sick for any longer and will soon have to face work, and I am so close to just harming myself enough to where I will not be able to come in, and I know what people will say. Why do not? I just quit? Well, the whole process of quitting is also giving me anxiety, so I am just stuck in this horrible cycle and do not know what to do. I am not usually this anxious.

The way my therapist explained it is that anxiety is basically a defense mechanism preparing you to face a threat. In order to do that, the body tries expel any waste, so it will not get later in the way and also suppresses your appetite, so you will not end up fighting or running on a full stomach. Thing is that defense mechanism evolved for protecting you from physical threats, like a lion or something in modern society, though the threats we are dealing with are more abstract, i, how I am going to pay my billsconfusion so that kind of response is not really helpful.

I used to be afraid of needles, not a phobia really just did not like them. I used to be scared. They would break in my arm and become stuck if that is your fear, I promise the likelihood of that happening is very minimal. These needles are so small, but surprisingly durable. Think about this. The prick will literally be about seconds. Youll feel the pinch and boom! Thats it. Look away. Talk to the nurse, she will likely distract you. Thats how my booster went. I did not even think about it. She was talking. I was talking, and all of a sudden prick, small second pinch, I did not even flinch. Lol, your phobia is understandable. No judgement from me. And I am sure others, you got this talk to the person giving the shot, let them know theyll help you.

Title: Needlephobia is ruining my life and causing my anxiety to spike big time.
Thread
To mentions of needles, injection and couid I have my couid booster vaccine tomorrow the past vaccination I have had my mum has come with me and been there during my freak outs and I managed it with her physically restraining me confusion she told me she wasnt able to come with me tomorrow because shes babysitting, and there is literally no one else who can take my little cousin tomorrow. I have asked all the people I trust and they all have work, other commitments. The only person who is free is my gran, who I havent even asked as she is very one sided and believes my fear is overdramatic and would actively make me worse if I brought her along. All the resources I have found online are just dont look at the needle, but just knowing there is one actively coming towards me triggers my flight or fight so bad I wont let anyone even touch me without lashing out at them, making me a danger to the nurse and myself. I dont know what to do, and I am having a major panic in and cant calm myself down. Just trying to breath in virtual hugs are needed, and any advice you have would be good tooconfusion

I used to fear needles but one time I had to get a shot by myself and that time I was able to get over it no promise that happens for you but you can do it maybe tell the doctor nurse your fear.

My car is being recalled and I have to take it the service center and get it fixed tomorrow. I have already scheduled an appointment online. I have never been to that service station and do not know how everything works. The only thing I am scared and nervous about is what to say. I need help with the exact words and sentences I should tell them help. I have safety recalls and service campaigns. I want to tell them what I am exactly there for. Ask them, how long will it take to fix the car and to confirm that everything is free of charge help. When I go to pick up the car, what exact words do I tell them? Amp I will really appreciate all the help I can get. Thank you.
Comments
Youre pretty much already on the right track. When you walk in, tell them you are here for your appointment, and you need safety recalls, fixed and service campaigns, if you know the exact things that need to be fixed, write those down. So you can confirm, with the service advisorconfusion, they usually offer how long itl take, but you can just say, how long do you think it will take? Sometimes they have all the parts and sometimes they will not. So you may have to go another day when it comes to cost. Just ask, will I owe anything when it is done? Picking it up? Just say, im here to pick up my car. Its a year make model

Title: All but accepted the russian invasion of ukraine confusion.

Following the conflict between ukraine and russia for much of yesterday and today, has done a number on me mentally, especially now that I am certain the invasion is going to happen. I feel repulsed, horrified and powerless by what may be about to happen. All I hope for at this point is that world war I does not happen.
Comments
We is very unlikely to happen from this. Nato is a very strong force. They will not go into we. For a non nato country, russia is not going to attack a nato country. And if they do that doesnt mean you will wake up to nukes flying in the sky. You wont be drafted either turn the news off and go outside homie unless you are russian or ukranian. The most you have to worry about is the stock market and gas prices rising.

Comments
Excercise. After a long time of not doing, it can feel really difficult. I have chronic anxiety, and I just started working out recently, most things will be too high impact to start. I started with online classes jump rope. All of it was really difficult and disheartening. Then I got a excercise bike, and it was way better. When I was tired, I could just sit. I was not panicking or running out of breath anymore. I suggest this a exercise bike to get you started.

Just start small just walking through your neighborhood at a brisk pace for minutes is so very helpful with health and with mental health I agree with the other commenter that anything is going to feel super hard I started pilates months ago after not working out for a long time yearsconfusion and it suucked only a month in and I could do waay more than the it day now I can tell when my form is bad and I do not stop nearly as much during the routines also find something you actually like doing I really do not like anything but I love the pilates class I take because confusion there is a routine that is different each time that I did not have to come up with confusion there is an instructor to tell you when you go to the next move, and if you are doing it right and confusion there is other people there that are suffering ink if they are. But I am fa sho so I like to imagine they are tooconfusion. Right along with me. I did not want to count reps, look at times or make up a workout routine. So even though I do not like doing it, I know the benefits outweigh not doing anything. And I have these reasons to, like, some aspect of it took you a while to get out of shape, so it will take a while to get back in, go easy on yourself for a minute personally, if iAm in a gym or going on a walk run. I have to listen to music that is upbeat and or angry. It lets me focus on the words and the meaning instead of whatever it is I am suffering through. I hate exercise. If you cannot tellconfusion, I will mouth the words, and I do not care if others see me although having a mask on helps with that lol.

When I first started exercising again, I started with some lightconfusion yoga. It did not make my heart rate go up too much. Then I increased the intensity of the yoga units I did, until it gave me a pretty high heart rate. But because I did it slowly, my body learned to differentiate between workout and anxiety. Together with therapy, I am now able to go the gym and do some boxing without anxiety. Edit boxing really helps with my anxiety, too.

Title: I am a year old woman with asperger's syndrome with very bad anxiety. I have a dream to become a cartoonist.
Thread
Asperger's syndrome is something that I struggled with even since I was a child used to always get bullied, because I was always the shy, quiet kid who sat alone in class, doing her own thing in subjects she struggled in and not interacting with other children. As I had trouble expressing myself emotionally and socially, all I would talk about was what my special interests and just go on about it for ages, because I had difficulty choosing topics to talk about, and my odd speech patterns did not help either with my social interactions. That was when I was a child. I do not struggle with much of these things anymore. After years of speech therapy and having a teaching assistant helping with the subjects I struggle in. Throughout the years of my education, I still have one now in university, and I am taking a course in digital creative media. She mostly helps in parts I do not understand in the subject, explains it in parts, and then I get the hang of it that always been my mindset whenever I did not understand something, and someone explained in parts which I can understand. Then I am confident. Although the anxiety of making mistakes and failing is still there, I love the course so much I enjoy ever so much like everyone is interested in what I am interested, and they are ever so nice. I took the course because its always been my dream to become a cartoonist of my own popularAdult cartoon to show and submit it to adult swim I love writing my own fantasy stories and I usually spend months working on them, but there is one that every time I write the story and read all of it makes me so emotional because the characters feel and think like real people and how they handle the problems they go through based on my struggles I went through and some humour in there. The characters are also unique in their own way as well. Even the villains are so interesting I have worked so hard on it for months now I am excited to make it into a reality eventually and I have gathered a small team of people of an artist, musician and an animator at the moment hopefully I can get more people in the future, especially voice actors. I am very passionate about doing this project I thought telling my story on here would be good, as despite all the things I went through, I am still here and doing what I love, I know people can make amazing things no matter if they have a learning disability or not. And I want you to know that do what you love, follow your dreams and keep going no matter how hard it gets or what anyone says, and that hopefully the tough time that you are going through does not last much longer.

It feels like this cannot be anxiety I am so detached and not with it that I feel completely numb and not real but on the other hand, my limbs always feel really weird and I feel like I have so much internal pain that I obviously am. Real panic attacks make me feel like I am dying even though I already feel dead. I hope this makes sense to someone.

Anxiety. Depression are comorbid and can and often do occur together. Depression symptoms can mask anxiety symptoms, and vice versa. The numbing effect of depression could easily take some of the daily intensity of the anxiety off. You may simply just not have enough energy to worry. For example, isolating from anxiety can easily breed depression isolating from depression can give anxiety when being around people again.

I realized that it seems like my anxiety always comes just in time for when my birthday comes around. Maybe it is because I hoped to accomplish more before the next year or the dreadful thought that I am getting older every year. It just sucks, because I would like to be happy and want to celebrate. But depression and anxiety seems to get the best of me on a day that is supposed to be special.
Comments
Yes, I do, too. Its partially the ageing and progress thing, but also to do with being the centre of attention. It hard to hide or blend into the background when it is your birthday. I feel such a pressure to be happy and funny and make plans that I just end up getting too anxious and hiding at home instead of doing anything. But ironically, deep down, I do want to do things and have fun on my birthday. I am just never relaxed enough to actually enjoy it. Also, I hate any opportunity for family members to ask what I am up to these days because it never feels adequate enough, especially as I get older

I have always kind of hated my birthday, but I turned last week. The existential dread and anxiety leading up to it were bad. I had a panic attack the morning of my birthday, and I have had a few since then blargh. It feels like a neverending birthday anxiety hangover. I think birthdays are ripe to cause anxiety. Getting older. Lots of expectations from friends and family or coworkers needing to appear happy or grateful when you might not feel that way or maybe that no one cares or something.

Comments
For me, the hot flashes get more intense when I start to panic, so my immediate response to them is affirmations, gently remind yourself it is a symptom of anxiety and or your sari. If you take one, I also will opt for a glass of cold water until I can feel myself cool down again. The best prevention is going to be regulating your overall anxiety. I know that is not the most helpful tip, but as with all physical symptoms of anxiety, they go away once you address the anxiety itself.

All you can do is be there and support her. Unfortunately, until she gets proper treatment, as someone who has severe anxiety issues, there is nothing worse than someone who is putting you down for it, not saying you are you sound great and supportiveconfusion. I know you wish you could do more and you wish you could just take it away. But it is not as simple. When she starts treatment, she either try new meds or a form of therapy. And again, all you can do is be supportive. It sounds like you really care, which is awesome. So just keep being understanding and hang in there. Best of luck.

Does she still masturbate by herself? If so, I do not think it is a libido issue. Maybe her anxiety is dancing with depression because of how severe it is been. So taking care of herself is a little tough right now. Maybe she does not feel desirable. Maybe she cannot work up the energy. Maybe she is just really tired because of the mental strain she is been under. Maybe she just wants to talk about it and cry and let some stuff out.

If she is already on meds as a fellow, anxiety deal with er those meds really fuck with your libido, and I already have all needed other meds to balance it out. So to speak, its common with anxiety. But during the moment, you can slowly work as a team to make her associate sex with relaxation takes a while. I have ptsd as well. And my partner and I have worked on this for the last nine months. You got to be patient. Good luck.

Hello. I suffer from anxiety myself, confusion and I can have zero sex drive too when I am feeling anxious. Recently, I got a new job and had no libido for like two months. I have a girlfriend too and she is really comprehensive like you I think it affect more me than her. I think I know that all my anxiety crisis are always temporary and I do not try to force myself for sex when I am like that. Do you know what cause anxiety to your girlfriend? I am trying to think of any advices to help you. Two english is also not my first language hope you can understand me. Happy face or smiley

At the start of my relationship, I very much was not ready and we immediately stopped having sex for the first months or so of dating what helped me was patience and being told that he did not want to have sex that included me pushing my limits that my comfort was more important than his desire that helped me to feel safe and let me come back out of my shell because I have a very high libido when I feel safe and a low libido when I dont

I was one of the weird individuals who sis made my sex drive go through the roof. I was constantly in the mood. I am about months in to getting off, sis and I am at about half the dose of what I was on for the past four years. My sex drive plummeted my partner, and I have been stressed. So we had the longest gap without noticing in the last little while when we had an opportunity. The same things that would have worked before were not getting me excited any more. I fell even deeper in love with my of for being patient and helping me relearn my body without know you or her. As an anxious girl, I would ask you to be patient and try to give her an opportunity to be honest about what works. Happy face, or smiley edited to adtongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry for me. The lovey stuff worked better off of sis on sis and in an anxious state, giving over control to a strong partner helped

Title: Took me years but I made the call.
Thread
Today, I finally called a therapist for the first time. I had yet another awful anxiety attack, and I am just so exhausted. Living like this, I literally called while trying to get my body to stop shaking, taking deep breathes, etc. I steadied my voice, and as soon as I hung up, it was back to the shakes and trouble breathing. But I also felt so proud. Phone calls are another thing that makes me super anxious, but I did. It left a message and sorta blacked out and did not remember what I even said. I was so nervous. She called back and left a message and even said she loved the message. I left because it was so honest, so that was nice to hear. She sounded so kind and friendly, and I am currently waiting to talk to her and set up a session. I have been wanting to do this since I was a teenager, but me, being a bit stubborn, mixed with the anxiety always stopped me. But something about this year, I feel so ready to finally make some positive changes. I still cannot believe I did it. I thought I would never get the courage to get help. Its funny, because I am, of course, nervous about starting this, but not how I usually am. I am nervous in the best way possible

Title: But what if I get anxiety when
Thread
Does anyone else ask them self this question when they are feeling great and anxiety free? Then all of a sudden anxiety and fear swoops in and ruins your day. I could be playing with my year old son, and that voice in my head will just be nagging at me. My partner could go to me whilst sitting on the sofa, babe, do you want to meet up with such and such this weekend for some food? Then I ask myself, but what if I get anxiety when I am there and it zaps me of my energy and I cannot enjoy myself and I might freak out, whats everyone is thoughts on this and have you managed you shift your thoughts so it does not effect. You teach me
Comments
Yeah, happened to me today actually had a bad day with it and nearly bailed on playing football because I felt terrible all day. Only reason why I did not bail was because it would have most likely made me more anxious, letting mates down at last minute I was in catch. We won. I played well and feel a lot better in myself this evening for doing it. Try to remember your own personal little victories. It still effects me. And of course it is not foolproof, but it can be the difference between saying yes of the time, is saying yes of the time.

Title: Having some intense health anxiety and need some reassurance.
Thread
For a little over two weeks now I have been getting what I think are pics, ectopic beats, palpitations. I feel them throughout the day, but every night or when I am sitting and laying down, they are constant and happen literally every couple seconds, it feels like my heart has a hard beat or flutter, followed by a pause and then another hard beat, like beat. I sometimes get a brief adrenaline rush, and I have had anxiety about this constantly. Since I first noticed it, I have had an ekg, which was normal. And my doctor listened to my heart for a while and said, it sounded good. I am afraid the ekg may have missed something serious since I did not have any palpitations during that time. And my doctor thought it was gi since I had acid reflux when it first started. But now it is not going away. Even though the acid reflux is gone, I am drained and have no energy and have not gotten more than hours of sleep in a couple weeks. I am so scared I have fib or a fatal arrhythmia or something, and I cannot calm down at all

If you were having something serious, I think an ekg would pick it up even if you were not aware of it. Also, hearts do not have regular beats. They vary by little bits all the time. I occasionally have something similar going on. It seems to happen when I am low on electrolytes.

I do not know if it will help you, but when I find that I am being irrationally anxious and falling down the rabbit hole of intrusive thoughts, playing out worse case scenarios, it helps to switch up your thinking to answer a simple question. The question I ask myself is, what would I tell the child version of myself who is feeling anxious and worried? What would I do to make that child feel safe and relaxed when you think of how to comfort the child within while being kind to yourself? It really helps bring you back to a rational state. It helped me a lot

I have been talking to a betterhelp therapist for a little over a month for help with anxiety, depression, and the session I had today left me feeling weird. I recently expressed to the therapist that I was unhappy in the rural area I live in and the situation I am in. But I also struggle with anything outside my comfort zone people and placesconfusion today, he randomly suggested I begin saving money and move to the united states, which I have absolutely no connection to. I am not from there and have no family thereconfusion. I guess I seemed disinterested in it, because he asked whether I had anything against the united states and said I had no life where I am living right now and asked what I would do if my mom just kicked me out. It felt like he was pressuring me to move to the united states. And I do not know why it never came up in a session before

There something to be said about getting pushed out of your comfort zone, but specifically saying to move to the us that seems pretty strange to me. I do not think you are being overly sensitive. That does seem like a weird suggestion to me too.

Title: Anxiety making it difficult to work.
Thread
Hi I am a recently graduated with a tech in computer science and soon started working for a service based it company for some background I have always suffered from anxiety I have seen multiple doctors and taken meds in the past I am seeing a therapist at the moment but my anxiety has gotten so bad since I started work nothing seems to be helping anymore at work I have a very hard time asking for help, which slows down my work significantly. Sometimes I work till late night since I have to figure out everything out by myself as I cannot ask for help I stress out too much about all the meetings and calls I have to attend to the point. I feel physically sick. I feel like I am out of breathe and I have no appetite. I am at a point where doing smallest thing has become a major task. I cannot quit the job since my parents do not understand what I am going through. Sometimes I feel so unworthy and stupid I feel like giving up. Also to add this company does not have a very good work culture. There are very tight deadlines. I have also heard the manager yell at a coworker in a call. Although he did not yell at me, I have been terrified of him since then, but I feel that I make up most of my problems in my head even though the workplace culture is not that great. I think this hasMore to do with my made up thoughts than anything else. So will it be wise to quit the job? Excuse my grammar english is not my first language any advice is appreciated. Thanks.

Hi there. Just my two cents recently. I learned that putting an ice pack on my chest really helps in calming my racing heart and thoughts. When I am really freaking out, I put one on my chest. Focus on the feeling of the cold on my skin and practice. Four count breathing count in count, hold, count outconfusion. I find it really helps ground me good luck.

Title: I am so useless.
Thread
This anxiety thing makes me so useless. I cannot study, I cannot exercise. I am just watching to all day. What a crap life. I wish I could just live like our ancient ancestors, where we would have to hunt for food, obtain water, and just do our best to survive it too difficult. Living in this day and age, because it requires that you are focused and stable. But at least with my anxiety, that is impossible. I hate all this. I just cannot express how I feel. I am irritated, I am stressed. I am sad. I just do not know

No, you are not useless. Confused face.

Title: Dae get intrusive thoughts, particularly late at night.
Thread
Like I literally cannot sleep. And it is been like this for weeks now, I have struggled with anxiety for as long as I can remember, but only recently has it been this bad, especially in my own bed, at my own home. It always the most far fetched scenarios, and I feel so pathetic for thinking of them, yeah, it is true that they are not impossible, but they are highly unlikely. It gets to the point where I am literally hiding under the blanket, afraid to even move, because all I can think about is myself being in the most horrible situations that are most likely never going to happen.

Title: Probiotics curing my anxiety.
Thread
I have had severe anxiety for several years now and tried nearly everything imaginable to try to manage it even going on an sari for nearly years recently I had trouble sleeping and began waking up in the middle of the night and somehow came across something that suggested there could be a connection between probiotics and better sleep well I started taking probiotics consistently and then after a couple of days I realized there was a very noticeable reduction in my anxiety and an increase in my overall mood. In addition to better sleep. Its not something I have seen discussed very much when researching treatments for anxiety, but I highly recommend anyone struggling to give it a try. I would say this is the best I have felt mentally in years, including while I was on sari. There is a definite connection between the brain and the gut, and I believe something like of serotonin is in the gut. So it actually makes sense. I have only been on them for a couple weeks, but the results have been so significant I felt the need to come on here to offer this suggestion to anyone struggling as far as a specific probiotic. In doing some research, I discovered the strains, bifidobacterium, longue lactobacillus, rhamnosus and lactobacillus helveticus are the best for anxiety. There are several brands that offer a probiotic with these strains, and I have ordered a few different ones I will experiment with again if you are struggling with anxiety depression thereMay be some underlying gut health issues, and I highly recommend trying probiotics.

Title: Today, I received a ketamine infusion as part of a research study.

Not sure if this is the right place, but thought, hey, I would quite like to share this happy face or smiley. I have been struggling with depression and anxiety for over years, been on different meds and have a therapist I see regularly. Despite making huge progress, I still have frequent relapses and out of the blue, anxious episodes. Being super interested in mental health research, I came across an advert looking for participants willing to lie in an mri machine while receiving a ketamine infusion. I thought, screw it! Sign me up will not happen. They probably have everyone they need fast forward a few months. And holy, wow! It happened today. I put myself on the frontline of research. What an experience.

Title: Panic when people visit my house.
Thread
Every time someone comes to my house without me inviting them, I have a panic attack or anxiety attack. I have other flatmates so this becomes really hard because people always show up without me knowing because someone else invited them. I obviously cannot ask them to not invite people over because it is their house, too. But I do not know what to do about this. Even if the person who comes home is my best friend. I still panic if I did not invite them. It been happening for almost months now, usually when it happens, my girlfriend helps me get through it, and I feel better, but I cannot always expect her to be there with me, and I want to fix this if she is with me, I feel better in, like min but if she is not there, then the attack will last for as long as the people stay at home. Once they leave, I will feel better within the next minutes. I do not know why this is happening or how to fix it in any way. If anyone has any advice, it would be really helpful
Comments
I know how you feel. I hate uninvited guests. I think you isolate yourself. And while not being rude, make the guest feel they have intruded. I am lucky I am in my and own a large house.

I have trouble staying awake. All I want to do is sleep. I have anxiety and depression, but I am on amitriptyline, my for migraines. It is supposed to help with anxiety as well.

I only took medication when I was a minor, so the anxiety medicine I could take was very few. So my opinion is coming from that the anxiety meds I did take made me extremely tired.

Just remember that this panic attack is not going to kill you remember that you have made it through all your other panic attacks and that you will also make it through this one focus on controlling your breath and try to distract yourself with things that you enjoy. Usually, for me, the simplest thing I do when I am having a panic attack is play puzzle games on my phone, and it helps me get through the panic attack. I hope this helps even if it is just the tiniest bit helpful.

Good luck I tend to do the same and write things down otherwise I would say stupid stuff. And then sometimes I still say stupid stuff and forget to read what I wrote down and I also end up speaking too fast and not making sense. Something that helps me with phone calls is telling myself the other person cannot see or strangle you. Youre uncomfortable, not in danger. Just calm down and pretend to be confident they cannot see. You think of how this is way better than being face to face ink if that helps, I am sure you will be fine, though youre going to feel so much better afterwards loudly crying face

I know this whole thing may sound pretty dumb, but im in panic in due to my anxiety. Its almost am, and im working on autopilot mode on my thesis right now. So I decided to put on a podcast about ghosts and stuff to keep my brain entertained. Everything was fine until they started talking about black magic and spells and all that crazy stuff. Suddenly I started getting super nervous. Im not a superstitious person, and I do not consider myself to be easily scared, but I suddenly felt symptoms of a panic attack laughing out loud ink how to explain this. But im feeling super vulnerable in as if I let the bad energy into my mindconfusion, and I keep having these intrusive, creepy thoughts about those topics. Again, im not a superstitious person or even an spiritual one, but I just cant shake this uneasy feeling that something bad may happen. Its weird since my anxiety has never been triggered over this topics. Has anyone felt this way too? If so, what should I do to ease my mind? Or is it just me? And my fucked up mind laughing out loud

I do not know if it will help you, but when I find that I am being irrationally anxious and falling down the rabbit hole of intrusive thoughts, playing out worse case scenarios, it helps to switch up your thinking to answer a simple question. The question I ask myself is, what would I tell the child version of myself who is feeling anxious and worried? What would I do to make that child feel safe and relaxed when you think of how to comfort the child within while being kind to yourself? It really helps bring you back to a rational state. It helped me a lot

Title: Anxiety over the well being of strangers.
Thread
I have always had social anxiety and I have always had high empathy. I also have adhd, which makes me extremely sensitive to rejection of any sort over quarantine. This has developed into me fretting over even the idea of social rejection, whether its towards me or a complete stranger. This brings me back to the high empathy I mentioned as we all know. People love to say terrible things about harmless people just for the fun of it. This is especially apparent on the internet. I cannot understand the mindset behind this, and I find it very frustrating. I get overwhelmed with anxiety as if I were the one being insulted, and the feeling only gets worse when I realize that theres nothing I can do to stop people from being hurt. I know that I am overreacting and I hate it, but also I know what it like to be made fun of or outlasted, and I cannot stand seeing others experience it. I have already distanced myself from social media to avoid seeing mean posts, but I cannot get rid of the lingering guilt sadness. I know that the happiness of everyone isn my burden to deal with. But as anxiety goes, rationality does not always prevail. Hopefully, this makes sense. Any advice or insight is greatly appreciated. Happy face or smiley.

Hey I am similar empath here and it can honestly be really stressful people can wrong me in my personal life and I can still somehow feel bad for them when things go wrong for them or just see the good side of them and then feel bad and do not tell them the honest truth that they hurt me even just colleagues and do not even get me started on animals I hate that I cannot do anything to help all the animals in the world and basically just have to try avoid any media on animal cruelty so I am not triggered I cannot watch horror films with any torture cause I start freaking out for the victim it can be so hard existing in a world that can be really cruel in some ways when you are very empathetic and I wish I had some help for you but I am also not sure what to do if you like we can chat about it together and let each other know if we ever find something useful.

And the past few days, I woke up with a cough that goes away after I drink some tea. Its winter where I live. So I am pretty sure the dry air is causing all this. In addition to my anxiety, I notice sometimes when I am breathing, I can feel the air hit the back of my throat. Upper chest is that normal. I have been taking benadryl the past few days, not consistently thoughconfusion, and it helps for a few hours. Eta had panic attack in november that started my health. Anxiety. Blood work, confusion, ekg, confusion and chest xray all came back normal.

Could be dry air. Try. A humidifier could be allergens due to snow. Had similar thing recently when it warmed up a bit, and I think snow mold gets active. Did the benadryl help? Could also be a colds? All of it is normal. If you have a fever, then start to worry if not give it a few days.

Title: Today was a bad day, but thats ok.
Thread
Today was a really bad day. I was anxious since the moment I opened my eyes. I went into my morning meditation, expecting to feel better afterwards. But didn I thought maybe when I started work, it would distract me, but nope, still the same. I barely got anything done today at work. I just finished washing the dishes and cleaning the kitchen, thinking, hey, maybe im not being productive enough. Guess what? Still anxious? I have just had a really bad day, but hey, it happens. Days like this happen. What is important is to know this and repeat it to ourselves, even though our body and mind wont believe it is a constant battle with ups and downs and we cannot be defeated at the lows. I am currently writing this while doing breathing exercises, and im feeling better little by little. So know that shitty days happen as well as great days. Just keep going and try to be better every day.

Sorry to hear you had a bad day. Mine was bad, too, and very similar to yours, barely got anything done and felt anxious throught the entire day. But anxiety is exactly that you get some really good days, even weeks and then bad days and weeks. It amazing that you are capable of telling when you are anxious or not. After a long time. Without that tool, it feels like a superpower. I started being capable of the same thing a few months ago, and eventhough my progress has been slow. It really helps. Knowing it is just anxiety. It makes it easier to understand, accept and let go

Sorry, you had a bad day. Sounds like your practice and perspective on life are great, inspired by your post.

Work can be extremely overwhelming. Don be afraid to explain that you are new if you are having trouble, customers tend to be nicer after you say that if your boss yells at you or gives you stern instructions do not take it personally. Their just doing their job, it depends on the boss. But if you ever feel panicked or unsettled to the point where it impacts your work, I am sure you could ask for a quick break to breathe.

I have had diagnosed anxiety for about years and just experienced my first significant chest pains over this past year or so first time. I called the ambulance after talking with my primary care doc and psychiatrist. I did follow up tests like you with stress tests, ekg pulmonary, etc. With no indicators of medical problems from those. The attacks were pretty frequent for several months, but I am so happy to say that now they only happen rarely and are not nearly as severe. I never figured out what triggered the attacks. But what helped me when they happened was sitting on the floor, with my head tilted back, deep breathing and reassuring myself this, too will pass. I also had awful cold sweats, so if I could access cold water that helped putting some on my neck, my doctor also gave me a low dose of propranolol that I added to my regular buspar, is dailyconfusion. I do not know if that has helped as well, but I am staying on it. Something is working. I wish you the best, and I hope that your attacks start lessening like mine did. It is such an unexplainable joyous relief to me that now, when I do feel my chest start hurting, then it stops within a few minutes without getting too scary and painful. You are not alone. And at least for me, there has been light at the end of the tunnel.

Hell, yea! The brain fog I get from overthinking too much. And being generally indecisive makes me come off as a dunce in public. Sometimes one story I have is I had jury duty a few weeks ago. I walk into the courthouse and they make you empty your pockets into a bin and retrieve your items on the other side of the counter for some reason. I thought they were holding your stuff until you leave. So I walk off and the guard had to chase me down. I was anxious as hell about jury duty, and that mishap was likely because of my anxiety. I was not thinking straight

Title: Anxiety accumulation.
Thread
Do you ever feel like when bad things happens? You somehow push it a few days, weeks, maybe even months, until you reach a neutral moment and actually feel the anxiety hit you? My question is born because, okay, context, I was diagnosed pre pandemic with panic attacks, but was doing cool. Then, around march, last year, dad and I were diagnosed with couid. He almost passed away, and I got some heavy complications. Then I kept pushing my education and all and everything felt right, specially with my dad doing better and eventually getting back home safe. But around a month ago, I finished everything I had left, graduated and all, and my anxiety hit like a fucking truck. My chest and arm hurts. I have thought I am having a heart attack like ten times. And my sense of doom for this new year is fucking me up, specially realizing, almost a year ago, we were doing really bad. Does something like this happen to any of all

Is graduating, resulting in you having to go out in the real world and get a job. Anxiety is flight or fight response, hijacked by a concerned brain, uncertainty, and change something the brain wants to worry about. I recommend the method for those times where it is a panic. I struggled with this at first because it was hard to both question myself and freak out. If you pre record you or a loved one asking those questions, it helps huge when panic strikes. The bad symptoms for me were largely when I was tired, dehydrated, hungry or over caffeinated. By managing those simple levers, the panic would rarely strike long term. You need to ground yourself in the present moment guided meditations are a great way to get into this and out of your mind. But there are thousands of ways to ground yourself in the present. Anxiety does not live in the present. Breath work, for example, works because you cannot think about breathing manually and freak out. At the same time, you shift your focus to the sensation of air in your nose or of the rising and falling of your diaphragm, and your thoughts are not ramping up anxiety. If you exhale longer than inhale, you activate the parasympathetic nervous system, and this brings you down naturally, usually in second, through the nose, pause one second, then a slow second exhale. Good luck.

Yes, hydrate. Assuming you think your phone touching a bag may have got you high, very unlikely that either meth or crack would get in your body through contact. Too much coffee is definitely a huge trigger. Breathe with deep exhales.

I cannot imagine feeling emotions again without the presence of anxiety, but I do not really know to me. It seems counterintuitive that my depression would override my anxiety because they usually develop together.

Sometimes when my depression is really bad, I notice that it will temporarily pause my anxiety. I think this is just because it makes me really apathetic and unmotivated. How am I supposed to be anxious about something? If I cannot even find the will to get out of bed or put bread in the toaster? Its the complete mental exhaustion that numbs the anxiety.

Title: Anxiety is making it difficult to make and maintain friendships.
Thread
So lately I have slowly been working on an issue I have and it is not been easy, persay, but anyways to start us off, I have the issue of just not ever messaging any of my friends and then I wonder why they never do me I guess I also am always on invisible. So that does not help. I have lately organized myself in attempts to remove this fear. I genuinely am not in the mood to even talk to anyone despite it being the main goal of today I sorta do not know how to go about this. My logic beyond this is that I am bothering them or something and sometimes if I get no response it is because they are not interested in me. Sometimes it could just because of the topic itself. I guess I do no good if I just send mes and expect responses, maybe I should resort back to just asking a few questions to open a conversation of some sort him ink. This is my inner dialogue, so I cannot say, I know how bad it is. It could be much worse. But atleast I am trying to face it before I let it drown me. It already has, though I do find it easier within a group though, to start conversations of some kind. One more thing before I kind of like send this to reddit or whatever. But like, okay, things I get annoyed by the fact that some other people will not doMe first and the people who do annoy me, I feel messed up. What do I even want at this point? And thing was like, I genuinely sometimes find it as if some friendships had a peaking point, and now that it is lost or even after meeting someone for awhile, that, like it would not be that way again or that like it is met, it is expiration date, as in, they would not even be interested, to some extent, this one is a newer thought. But I am trying to head my anxiety off as much as possible. Ya know,

I do not know if it will help you, but when I find that I am being irrationally anxious and falling down the rabbit hole of intrusive thoughts, playing out worse case scenarios, it helps to switch up your thinking to answer a simple question. The question I ask myself is, what would I tell the child version of myself who is feeling anxious and worried? What would I do to make that child feel safe and relaxed when you think of how to comfort the child within while being kind to yourself? It really helps bring you back to a rational state. It helped me a lot

I am also extremely anxious about a flight coming up. So I know the feeling it permeates through every other aspect of your life. I think you have got to think logically does it make any sense at all that somehow, death is pre planned and is based on peoples good fortune? No, it is completely chaotic and random. We have to live with that to think of death as an entity rather than an event is the flaw in logic. I think next air travel is incredibly safe. I always think like this. There are literally of flights everyday. What makes you think you are so special that something will go wrong with yours. Youre not special. Its just like another bus ride to the pilots, just doing their job so they can go home to their partners and children.

Title: Diagnosed anxiety thursday from heart palpitations.
Thread
Hello, everyone. I actually just turned. I am a male. I recently got told that my issues are due to anxiety started with an episode of fib in june, got an ultrasound and wore a heart monitor for weeks. The day of the ultrasound, I remeber the lady, sticking the tool in my sternum, and when I got home I finished an energy drink. I started palpitations. This is when my journey started. I have had an endoscopy done, an abdomen cat scan done. My main symptom is I get palpitations. Very often. I never really get them during the week they usually start about am on a friday and go until monday morning. Its really annoying, because I get paranoid. There is something wrong. I get worried. I have some sort of heart issue coping with this has been pretty tough. I feel it the most with a hangover. And sometimes I feel it while I am drinking alcohol as well. It is odd, though, because there are some nights I drink, and I do not feel it at all. Whenever I tried to replicate the issue for the doctor, my palpitations would go away right before the appointment. I am pretty frustrated, because it just sucks. I felt a couple today when I was hungry and felt or yesterday after laying down, I cut out caffeine this week and plan on for awhile to see if this helps. I have been feeling pretty good today. I wish I could stop thinking about them becauseIt makes me more anxious if its going to happen or not I am most likely going to go to therapy since this all started after a traumatic situation. It has been months now I hate it. I really do. I feel like it takes a way my peace of mind when it comes to living a normal life I am also paranoid it will lead to a stroke it just sucks I am hoping things get better I am not sure if anyone else is in the same boat I also am an ex smoker paper. So I get paranoid its something with my lungs I dont have anyone to talk to about this since I got told to man up by my family. Lol. Thanks if anyone has insight

Should elaborate, more prescribed paroxetine for years. Now much better. Now thank god it all started with unhealthy amount of stress at work plus lack of sleep. And to top all that high caffeine intake couldn sleep more than hours a week. Them got a sleep meds for weeks which fixed me. Then prescribed paroxetine.

Title: Anxiety or maxx symptoms to worry about.

So I got my second dose of the pfizer couid vaccine and while my first dose I felt almost nothing with the second immediately afterwards I felt a burning sensation by the injection site I started feeling really hot tbe it was a hot day but continued even as I was in the air conditioned cos drinking gatoradeconfusion then I kept getting these headaches and waves of nausea along with them which especially hurts because my anxiety is very based around throwing upconfusion I felt super anxious kept pacing around but eventually as I feed my brother and he talked me down gradually it went away only thing afterwards is for a week or so, the ground would seem uneven to me sometimes when I walked afterwards but that also went away. Thing is now my university is requiring that I get a booster. I often hear symptoms get worse with each dose, I really do not want to deal with those symptoms again, and I would rather get an exemption since I am not in an at risk category and am already double vaxxed. But it is been pretty much impossible to get exemptions from my university and other institutions. Thing is, I have not heard of anyone else getting these symptoms right away. How many of them do you guys think could be anxiety? And how many the vaccine itself I was prone to anxiety attacks anyway at the timeconfusion? And should I just grit my teeth and get the booster or try forThe exemption anyway. And what should I do if they do not accept the exemption?

Grit your teeth and get the booster I am not sure where you heard that every shot gives you worse symptoms but I do not believe that to be true it does seem like your anxiety is making it worse as you start feeling poorly.

Symptoms would not happen immediately. Youre supposed to wait minutes only be an allergic reaction happens instantly. The actual side effects take hours after the shot goes into your bloodstream. Its just anxiety. Please get the booster to protect others.

We went to the vaccination center yesterday to get the couid shot for our kids and yoconfusion. We waited a long time before deciding to get them vaccinated because we were scare. Everything went smoothly. The kids were a little bit scared, but they understand why we had to do it now later I get a phone call from the vaccination center telling me that out of the kids who got vaccinated yesterday received the wrong vaccine. Instead of pfizer they were given modern half dose. They are unable to find out wich kids it was so they are calling everyone to let them know they told us to watch for cardiac and respiratory problem and that they will call us every few days to check on them. I am so scared right now I do not know what to do. I just had a panic attack. I am not expecting anything by writing this. I guess I just needed to vent

I have suffered a couple of significant losses in the past year, and my mental health has taken a massive hit from it. I cannot put a finger on it, but tonight I am freaking out. I just have this sense of impending doom. I try to rationalize and tell myself that as far as I know everything and everyone is ok at this moment, and there is no way to predict or change the future, but the sickening feeling in my whole body is unbearable. I cannot stop the random bouts of crying and every breath I take feels like I am suffocating.

I cannot speak for every part of your situation, but generally working out will boost your self esteem as a teenager, exercise equipment can be rather difficult to access if you grow up in a poor household as I did so I would suggest doing some beginner calisthenics.

Title: I have unpassed overdue homeworks.
Thread
I have a list, and yes, it is true. I have no valuable reason on how I havent passed modules, which is why I could not ask help from anyone. It just got worse and got worse everyday, and I keep on getting more pressured each day to even start doing something. I feel bad that I am my parents child. When they deserved better, I tried to go with the mindset of I dont care anymore if I pass this late. And if my answers are terrible, what matters is I passed it. But after hours of answering, I only managed to finish out of. I cannot ask anyone for help, even my friends, because most of these are days, weeks, months, and even a year ago, and they definitely have already forgotten about it. In fact, I basically cheating at this point, but most subjects cannot be cheated with zero way of finding answers. Even the answer key is made like trash on purpose. I do not know what to do anymore, and I decided to screw everything and just keep on doing my initial plan, no matter how long it took. Also, my parents dont know about this, but im in a situation right now where a small mistake would lead to them knowing I am so afraid of it to the point where I mastered the art of changing my actions and words, so they wont notice or mention anything about school. I absolutely cant tell them, because I always tell themIm fine. Also, my problems are small compared to theirs, so I cant really be emotional about it. But then again, unpassed overdue homeworks is not really a small problem. It could even be a world record failure if you are still reading this, I sorry that you had to read through a pathetic year olds drama that is insignificant and worthless. I feel mixed on emotions on what is coming next, and I so close to cutting myself so everyday I will be reminded of the pain and why I did it. So maybe I would not run away from anxiety and fear of starting anything again.

Your problems are important it is difficult and uncomfortable to admit to your parents when something is wrong but they need to know so they can help you also I know it means little coming from some random person online but self harm is never the answer I did it for years at your age and it only made things worse if the stress of talking to your parents face to face about what is going on is too much you could always attempt to explain to one or both of them via text email it might sound odd but at least you would be able to address the situation once the ice has been broken via that message, you might find it easier to open up to them

Title: Anyone else have to limit things they enjoy because of anxiety.
Thread
So this might sound strange, but sometimes I purposely avoid things I really enjoy, because the excitement eventually translates into anxiety. For instance, I really enjoy anime, but I hardly ever watch it, because depending on the show movie, I get too invested and excited, and it eventually leads to me feeling really anxious. Tight chest, amp, throat feeling like my breathing is not satisfactoryconfusion. If I pace myself, sometimes it works out okay. But other times the feeling persists, even after I have stopped watching it really frustrating cause, especially in this context, I see people gushing about how good a certain show is or how cool certain characters are, and I want to check it out myself. But I feel like I can. I spend so much time missing out and not to mention the spoilers I end up getting, because I am always behind. I get the same way when I try to play multiplayer online games, or if I get really invested in a book, I have always kind of been this way honestly. But since getting older, my anxiety in general has gotten worse, so I get overwhelmed more easily.

Title: What a day.
Thread
I work at mcdonald. My first customer of the day was an absolute jerk mirroring my questions back to me when I asked if they were vaccinated and if they had proof turned out they did not and they left. I have come to expect things like this. So customers being difficult does not rattle me as much as it used to. No. What made today spiral out of control was somehow getting into a fight with a coworker. I am still repeating the event in my head, trying to see what I could have done better to avoid this so far. I am coming up short. I was packing an uber and noticed the food I had did not match the drinks of the bag I was about to put it into. I checked the bag next to it that was sealedconfusion and saw that one had the drinks that matched this food. This was the third bag I caught with this kind of mix up today. So I said over my shoulder in my usual voice and tone, hey, guys, we need to pay more attention to which bag we are packing because these have been mixed up. This girl I did not even know, whirled around and started dressing me down like a toddler. Don you dare talk to me that way. If you have a problem with how I work, then you can talk to management about it, but you do not talk to me like that. I am like, wif andRespond as such what I was just saying we need to be careful you said, we need to pay attention. Yeah, you do not talk to me that way me with sarcasm and a bit of anger so it is fine for people to talk to me this way but not you I not everyone else and I honestly cannot recall what she said after that. Wow, I did not even use a tone. I was just so shocked and surprised that I did not know what else to say or do and just got back to work as she turned away, it kept repeating it in my mind, and I asked another coworker who she was, which lead to them asking if I was ok and that started my tears. I could not stop them and had to walk away. After splashing some water on my face and a minute in the freezer, I went back out but ended up breaking down again as one of my managers asked me if I was ok, I could not breathe, and I started crying again. I was so embarrassed to cry at work, and I realised I was having a small panic attack because of this nonsense I was sent home and apparently we are going to have some kind of a mediation meeting at some point which I am dreading. I hate confrontations. I cry every time I am too old to be this sensitive, but anxiety makes it impossible to stay on control. I hateBeing like this and wish my brain would just stop doing this anyways. I just needed to vent. Thanks for reading.

I am fucking terrified of psych wards. I mean, to be fair, im sure a lot of people are, but I never really thought about it that much until I started finding some fucking horrifying info about them. Did you know they have freaking solitary confinement? I mean, wif, how is that supposed to make you better? Its literal prison. There is no fucking difference anymore or forcing some weird ass injection in to you and fricking, having guards and medical staff pin you down, making you take your fucking cloths off. I mean, ive seen horror stories about mental asylums, but god, I never quite expected they were anything close to realistic. This is literally going to give you nightmares. The fact is that they can actually force you to go honestly the way those people with depression, anxiety, etc, are treated. It just makes me lose faith in humanity
Comments
I have been in a psych ward times in my life each of those times almost everyone was really nice, and I met some really amazing people. It a normal hospital, probably even a little more comfortable than your average hospital. If people get injections or are being detained, it is only to protect them or others. There are very strict legal regulations for those cases, at least where I live.

First I would ask what your reasons are for not wanting to use sis as they aree. Most commonconfusion and go from there. Psych meds are not one size fits all. And the younger you are the less formed frontal cortex is, which means the side effects from a medication that are minimal for someone else may be immensely more difficult for you. Barring sis, you may ask about saris, in which case I would recommend cymbalta over effexor personally. However, unless there is a medical reason or a previous reaction to an sri, most professionals will not start you on a different class until you have tried some sis

There are good people in this world maybe you have been dealt a shitty hand and have only seen the worst of the worst I completely know what you are talking about with more bad than good in the world but you have to look at it from two prospective to have an opinion like that. What you do does in fact matter no matter how small it is, there is a ripple effect that each person causes. Every person has their dark side and flaws but you should look beyond that when judging character for the good people you seem very pessimistic and maybe you have been treated very badly just know that you do matter and there are still a lot of positive aspects to this world dont give up yet.

Title: How do you handle your anxiety when the situation is not in our control or its not an instant fix?
Thread
Most of my anxiety is triggered by the situations which are not in my control, and it soon converts into panic attacks. For example, I do not have a job yet, and I am working on finding one, but just the fact that it takes time makes me anxious. Similarly, my parents trigger my anxiety with criticizing thoughts, but I cannot do anything about it until I afford to move out. My anxiety is also triggered online. When someone criticizes me or ignores me, and I feel compulsive to react to the situations by blocking people or by leaving groups. I cannot just wait and do nothing. I feel compulsive to react to the situations instantly in the defense of the things that cause my anxiety
Comments
I am in the same boat as you. Man it could be an anxiety and ocd combo or adhd as well. Impatience can cause you to feel nervous because you want results now to fix certain issues and need the positive feedback from an outlet. Have you ever found that you feel calm or a little happy when you play video games and you are winning? Its the same concept for basically, everything. When you have mental health struggles, it can be tough to grow confidence or even be at ease when there is a lot of stressful triggers happening the best way to handle. It would be to accept the fact that it will take some time, its easier said than done, and might not be what you want to hear, but when it comes down to it, give yourself some reassurance that you will get to the destination you planned still, its all a matter of prospective and self talk. Just know that the timing may not be in your control, but the outcome is

So let us talk through this. Youve clearly got health anxiety, so do I that will automatically take normal occurrences and turn them into perceived life threatening situations. Chest pain can have so many causes. Herd is one of them, but also something less talked about. Costochondritis is the inflammation between the ribs and where the ribs connect to the sternum. This can create sharp pains around the heart and chest area that said, I am a nurse and have been for years, and I have never seen someone have a heart attack that lasted days, nor have I seen a heart attack not be caught by an ekg. They did the ray to rule out any kind of physical deformity that could be causing the pain as well as pneumonia or another lung disease. So, you know you are clear of that. Take a deep breath, you are had a clear ekg and ray, you are not having a heart attack. Heart attacks do not last for days and pass an ekg.

So I have suffered from health anxiety for years now, my fears range from stroke to heart attacks to contracting hiv. I am really young, so the odds of something like a stroke or heart attack are really low. I do have really bad herd, which sometimes comes with chest pain, and that always triggers my anxiety. Last monday, I went to the er with chest pain. They did an ekg and rays and told me everything looked good, but I still cannot shake off the fear of having a heart attack today. The chest pain is back, but it is more of a ticklish feeling that comes and goes. I have been on the verge of a panic attack for the couple of hours be. I cannot shake off the thought that maybe this is a heart attack

I am literally going through the same thing right now I had a bad flare up of herd the last couple weeks with terrible heartburn and chest pain burning tightness, all types of weird feelings. Now the heartburn aspect is mostly gone, but I still have been getting these weird feelings in my chest, like the tickling feeling you mentioned I am wondering if it is part of the healing process from the herd attack, but ink the tickling and other weird sensations makes me tense up a lot and feel like I cannot relax at all. I am constantly tense, and I think that is making my muscles feel weird, which further adds to the problem of weird sensations. But I definitely share your same fears of a heart attack, although I am only its just a vicious cycle of worry and it sucks. I am sorry you are going through it too, but just know you are not alone.

Ive been going through the same thing for a few weeks now. I have seen a cardiologist and told him my concerns, and he told me everything looked fine as well. Anxiety loves to insist that there is something horribly wrong, even when the facts say, otherwise, try to find something that distracts you from these thoughts. Fears. Happy face smiley.

Here some advice no one is ever going to date you because they feel bad for you. I mean, what would be the point? People only date people when they want to date them because she finds you attractive, you have things in common, and she trusts you, re and have anxiety. I was once in your position, and I understand how horrible it is, especially with these thoughts of self doubt and low self esteem. Just know that your of would not be there if she did not want to be. I think it would be a good idea to go see a therapist for the time being if you are nore already open up about your feelings with them, and also be honest with your of about how you feel also seek medication as well.

I had a long excruciating talk with my boyfriend about this. I told him going to therapy and getting medication will not cure me. It will help me cope. He did not understand, so I literally had to do the if you were in my shoes thing. If you had anxiety since childhood and you are struggling with a new move and all your spouse is doing is yelling and insulting you for having anxiety, how would you feel? Because he also said our relationship was toxic because of my anxiety. I have had talks. I have gotten my hospital papers in front of him for him to read. I have sent him articles and little graphs about anxiety. If he wanted to read any of this, he would do it on his own. But regardless, I did try. I believe it all comes down to if he truly cared, he would confusion do his own research and confusion. Not be so harsh about putting all blame on you and actually take accountability. Sweetheart, if he will not respect your mental health after trying to explain it to him, which you have, and you have even expressed a boundary with him, which is awesome confusion. He will not respect it in the future, theres no changing guys, like the self centered ones they blame you before they ever take accountability, and then the gaslighting will come, etc. If you can run as fast as you can if you cant just keep expressing that you are takingTime to focus on yourself and what is he doing to fix the communication? I am proud of you for mentioning that it is not just you in this relationship. Dont let him convince you this is your issue. Stand up for yourself. No matter how scary it is, you will feel powerful afterwards.

I have been so anxious over it today I was determined to get it done. I put my food in the oven and made myself do it. My stomach is now tense, turning a bit. I am shaking like crazy, but its done. Call was fine. Very easy, told them they day I wanted it in and that was it. Apart from some details I so frustrated I have this fear. Nothing scary has ever happened over the phone. I happily do stuff online, talk in person, but phonecalls are hell it the strangest fear and I do not get it. I get my other anxieties, but this one urge. It done. My car is booked in. I fail straight away due to a sensor fault. Car runs fine with it tested safely, abs system works fine.

One of the key things is to recognize your anxiety and start to understand when it is talking and when it is trying to take control that what my therapist told me. Now when I get anxious thoughts, I recognize that it is my anxiety and I can tell it to fuck off and continue my day. Just recognizing that it is there helps at least a little bit.

I was a very athletic and smart kid in school until my anxiety took over in high school, and I could not be myself anymore. It robbed me of so much. I wanted to make a career in the military, and I did not join fear of failure, fear of life, fear of my fucking self, worry of everything hating myself, self doubt, etc. But it really all boils down to anxiety. My dad has issues with this, and after a lot of therapy, I think that I picked it all up from him at a young age, and I hate it, and I kind of hate him for it, even though I know it was not on purpose.

Thread
I have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder for years. I have gotten my panic attacks down from a week down to one every few months recently I hurt my back lifting a potted plant. I have been treating it with massages and physical therapy. In this process, I have realized that most people unclench when they are not using muscles. I basically have everything tense all the time. I have done yoga and mindfulness techniques that help while I am doing them. But as soon as I stop consciously thinking about relaxing a specific muscle, it goes back to tense fully tensed is my default. How do I fix this

I am so exhausted after dealing with this since I was child. I know I should have got the vaccine earlier. I have talked myself into it a few times, but backed out last minute. I am a year old female, very overweight. And from what I have read, everyone makes that out to be a death sentence with couid. But I have no other health problems other than a thyearoid disorder. I am not sure if that makes me a higher risk or not. I just really need someone to tell me I am going to be okay. If I get sick, I know I will probably have people think I am crazy, but I just need to sleep, and I cannot get my mind to rest

The new variant is not the same as the earlier ones. Its more mild symptoms. I was around people who had it and never got it. I am not vaccinated either due to health reasons. Calm down if he is not sick by now, chances are he will not be and neither will you.

For a little over two weeks now I have been getting what I think are pics, ectopic beats, palpitations. I feel them throughout the day, but every night or when I am sitting and laying down, they are constant and happen literally every couple seconds, it feels like my heart has a hard beat or flutter, followed by a pause and then another hard beat, like beat. I sometimes get a brief adrenaline rush, and I have had anxiety about this constantly. Since I first noticed it, I have had an ekg, which was normal. And my doctor listened to my heart for a while and said, it sounded good. I am afraid the ekg may have missed something serious since I did not have any palpitations during that time. And my doctor thought it was gi since I had acid reflux when it first started. But now it is not going away. Even though the acid reflux is gone, I am drained and have no energy and have not gotten more than hours of sleep in a couple weeks. I am so scared I have fib or a fatal arrhythmia or something, and I cannot calm down at all

So for some very weird reason making phone calls to people I do not know is terrifying. I will not answer my phone unless I know the number so my car needs its mot I have been to the place before nothing scary. But I have been putting it off for weeks. I have been so anxious over it today I was determined to get it done. I put my food in the oven and made myself do it. My stomach is now tense, turning a bit. I am shaking like crazy, but its done. Call was fine. Very easy, told them they day I wanted it in and that was it. Apart from some details I so frustrated I have this fear. Nothing scary has ever happened over the phone. I happily do stuff online, talk in person, but phonecalls are hell it the strangest fear and I do not get it. I get my other anxieties, but this one urge. It done. My car is booked in. I fail straight away due to a sensor fault. Car runs fine with it tested safely, abs system works fine. It is a system glitchconfusion, hoping it only costs me a couple of hundred to fix up, taking extra work to pay for it. So victory to an annoying anxiety. Please go away and stop giving me physical symptoms. Now

Title: Anxiety is a demon.
Thread
Seriously, anxiety, making everyday life a living, hell, intrusive thoughts, constant fear, panic attacks, disassociation, constantly worrying, overthinking every little thing until it drives you insane. I hate anxiety. I wish it would go away. I wish I could live a life free of anxiety and depression. The people who do not suffer with mental health do not have any idea how lucky they are.

My wife does not understand my anxiety, even though I know she struggles with her own. I have sought help from a doctor and got on lexapro, which has helped she does not believe in taking medication and thinks I should just live with it is frustrating. Being in a relationship with anxiety.

My husband has not directly blamed any marital issues on my anxiety. However, it is a problem that he does not empathize at all with mental health. Hes that way with literally everyone, not just me. Hell tell me, sorry, he knows he should, but he just doesnt. Its sucks, because I feel like I cant truly rely on him for support, which obviously is not great for our marriage.

Title: Sleep anxiety.
Thread
Hey, I was just wondering if sleep anxiety is a thing like when I am trying to go to bed and I close my eyes at night because I am tired. I get really uneasy about being in my bed and have to either watch videos or talk until I pass out or get out of bed and stay up. Its not because I have anything on my mind either. Its not insomnia, I do not think, because I am tired. And most nights I can sleep. But sometimes I just get intense uneasiness and become extremely uncomfortable when trying to sleep. What is this
Comments
Sleep. Anxiety is a real. You are alone in your bed in the dark with nothing but your thoughts. As you wind down from the day, I always had a problem where I needed to raise my left arm and keep shaking it as I squirmed around in bed, try taking melatonin and practice a breathing, excercise inhale for seconds, hold for seconds, exhale for seconds and repeat while doing this. Assure yourself that you are okay. Anxiety can be tricky and give you physical symptoms, and that could cause it to become worse. So be careful, googling symptoms. There are probably many things in your head that you are unaware that could be causing anxiety, but just know that it is normal. You are not alone, and it will pass. If this is something that happens for weeks and you cannot cope, I would talk to someone you trust about it. Then maybe see a doctor. I use the calm app. Sometimes, nothing works, and I have episodes where I get so overwhelmed that I pass out best of luck,

And when trying to sleep, ill get into the rem cycle, confusion and suddenly start having heart palpitations, which leads to my panic attacks. Today, I went almost all day feeling like I could not breathe, including the tightness around my rib cage amp. Im wondering if I should see a doctor or could this be something else that is not anxiety?

Most likely anxiety. I have been diagnosed with gad, and I have experienced all the symptoms you listed beside the heart palpitations in rem. But I would have trouble sleeping because I would remuninate a lot, which would cause anxiety. Sometimes, panic attacks, therapy and medication have brought it mostly under control. You should definitely speak with a professional.

This is slightly relatable to me ive had one obe but it was long before my anxiety however the physical symptoms such as the breathing and tightness around chest is common with anxiety I had heart palpitations so I saw a doctor and had an ekg on my chest for a week I have always had a fear about my heart stopping brain clotting blood being messed up not breathing and thats what triggers my anxiety going to the doctor for a normal check up helped me a little because he assured me my be was fine heart was healthy and lungs were in tact so maybe go get a check up and get some sense of relief try breathing exercises also inhale for long seconds hold for seconds and exhale for seconds try to assure yourself that you are okay because most likely you are anxiety is very common but I am also not a doctor so the only way to know if you are okay is by seeing one it will make you feel much better good luck

Yes, and just know this is very common. I have anxiety, and I never have a horrid gut feeling. I have chest discomfort and tightness, and my heart rate and lungs will increase because of panic. Try to stablize your breathing by counting slowly to seconds on an inhale and hold it for seconds and exhale for seconds and repeat. That is a quick remedy to calm down if this becomes more of a problem, consider taking notes in your phone when you have these episodes and your symptoms and contact a doctor for a check up. Best of luck.

Title: Overcoming health anxiety hypochondria.
Thread
I am a year old guy living in south of europe. I work as a tourist guide in my country. Fortunately, I have a family I have a partner, I have a lovely pet, and I suffer from moderate, sometimes severe health anxiety, hypochondria. I do not really know when it started I know I was always a bit hypochondriac, but never to this extent I was diagnosed with type diabetes at the age of. Nobody knew what I had. Several visits to the hospital were no solution. I was loosing weight. I was constantly drinking water, sleeping on the floor because I simply could not stay awake due to the lack of energy and nutrients until my parents brought me to this doctor who simply looked at my face, and he told my parents to go immediately to the hospital with a letter written by him this letter had type diabetes written on it. Immediately, I was put into intensive care, and the day after my dad went to the doctor to thank him, and he told my father it was almost too late. I was about to enter a diabetic. Comma. Was this my trigger for being an hypochondriac? I do not know, but I do suffer from this back in. When the pandemic started, I had my first severe anxiety crisis. I had a panic attack for the first time, and I thought I was going to die. I did not know what a panic attack felt like. I started constantly checking myPulse checking by blood pressure, going to doctor to tell, I was not feeling ok. I did several exams to my heart breathing, test, blood tests and everything came out, ok. But still, I was not convinced, neither by the results, neither by the doctor. I started having more panic attacks whenever I ate in the middle of nowhere. One day I woke up with a racing heart. I felt that so bizarre. I got out of bed and immediately by heart, jumped to bum. I felt dizzy and had an incredible and astonishing fear inside myself. I had to go to the hospital, and once again, everything was ok. I was told it was only anxiety. Several weeks passed, and finally, one day, I went to my endocrinologist, which is the most lovely doctor ever. She helps me a lot managing my blood sugars as I have diabetes, and she decided to prescribe me a drug which many of you may know lexapro, escitalopram. I started taking it, and some weeks after everything seemed to go back to normal, I took it for months and then stopped, because I felt much better with my anxiety, and I started working out cycling, and it really helps with anxiety, which I find incredible. I tapered off the pills and I resumed my normal life. Now, almost year after something happened, I started feeling anxious again, because I had gastrointestinal symptoms, which started back in christmas and did not went away. I went to a doctor and sheTold me I might have irritable bowel syndrome, which is also linked to anxiety. Since I am an hypochondriac, I started googling the symptoms and one search leads to another and to another and to another. Then I had couid, had all the symptoms, and after weeks, I was feeling ok but not at. I always had fear of couid sequels like long couid, I decided to work out, and I felt so bad afterwards with a racing heart that my anxiety went up in an incredible way. I am again having all sorts of symptoms, which only get worse as I google them and cannot relax my overthinking. I have racing heart, I feel dizziness, lack of appetite. I am loosing weight. I feel unstable. I feel like I cannot breathe properly. I have chest pain, I do not sleep well. I wake up several times. I have bounding pulse. I can feel my heart everywhere in my throat, in the back of my neck. My body seems to bounce with my pulse. I have fear of loosing control over my life. So I went to a psychiatrist and psychotherapist, and he told me to take lexapro once again, and we will do therapy to help me with my health anxiety. I felt worried about taking lexapro again as I have fear of having to take it for years which I absolutely do not want. I googled the side effects and I see so many people talking about the side effects, the taper, which seemsDifficult that they had to take it for years or that they cannot go off of it. I felt so anxious about taking it again, but I decided to accept it and just take it. I know it is temporary. I will take it for some months, and that what I need is strategies to cure this health anxiety for good. I want my life back. So I am at one week after starting the meds, I still do not feel it. I know it takes some weeks. So now I am trying to cope with the anxiety and symptoms the best way I can. I even have fear of being alone at home with fear of being dizzy or not feeling ok, but I have to face this fear and not let it control my life. It is just a bad phase, and I will overcome it. I am sure just wanted to share this and see if someone can relate. It helps to calm me down, to see other people with the same struggles and gives me hope. Thank you.

I am dealing with a lot of the same things as you, and it sucks so bad, and I am sorry, you are going through it too, but just know you are not alone in this, even though it feels like it. A lot of us out there are right there with you and can relate. I had a bad flare up of gi issues a couple weeks ago, and ever since then, I have been having all types of weird feelings in my chest. Breathing has been feeling weird, and my heart has been bounding, beating like you described. I am so tensed up and I cannot relax at all. When I try to relax my muscles, I get the weirdest feelings, like my skin is crawling or something. I try to tell myself it is just my anxiety, but my mind will not accept it. I just keep thinking I must have some deadly disease or on the verge of death. Its so scary and exhausting anyway, just wanted to let you know im with you. And it sucks if you ever need a friend to talk to or vent to hit me up any time.

Hello, everyone sorry. I do not know if this is going to be long. I am just going to type. If someone could read it, I would be really grateful. I really need some help for the last week, I have been on the verge of tears constantly, and today I cried for the first time in probably years I mid maleconfusion I wake up often throughout the night. Sometimes I make it back to sleep other times I dont and whatever happens, I cannot get back to sleep from onward, I just lay there worrying, nearly crying for hours. I have constant thoughts of inadequacy letting down my family guilt, fear of failure, fear of something happening to my wife and me being unable to cope, alone or unable comfort my boys as my wife would, or that they do not feel like I love them. The subject of the thoughts changes and progresses. Ie sometimes I think that I do not have a good enough job while my friends have careers, I just work for a company. I joined other times. It is that I do not have enough friends of my own. We have joint friends, hersconfusion that I have adopted, because we are a couple, and I have moved away from mine. And other times I feel like I have not shown my children enough love. And if they are happy, there are a lot more thoughts than those, and they just keep cycling deep down. I know my children feel lovedI guess like most children, they go to their mum for comfort, and I know they are happy. So although that is the thought that started this all a week ago, I feel like I can disregard it weirdly. The rest of the thoughts ultimately are true, and I have known it for a while. Its just that I have started obsessing about them all the time. I have never really cared about my job before. All I wanted was my family to be happy. I know I am capable of so much more, but I just do not have the strength to try. I am waffling a bit now, frankly, I am scared. I feel like this is never going to go away. It only been a week I did manage to forget about it yesterday. Somehow it seems like the night time is the worst, and then it hangs over to the morning. Lack of appetite is a bonus, though. I be slim again in no time slim and miserable.

First, let me state that I am not a medical professional, but I am a lifelong anxiety fighter. So I hope my advice can help it. Sure, sounds like anxiety. Since it just started, you cannot technically be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, but that sounds a lot like generalized anxiety disorder. Thats one that I have, and it is tricky to combat it because of how constant and looming it is. I would suggest maybe talking to your doctor if all of a sudden you are feeling very emotional, maybe you have a hormone imbalance. But again, that is not my area of expertise. Breathing exercises are never a bad idea. You could also give meditation a try. I struggle with it, but if you can focus your mind on the words, it can help you relax. Best of luck,

Title: Recovering from anxiety, some brief tips that have worked for me over time.
Thread
I was diagnosed with gad and ocd when I was years old. I was basically a trainwreck of an adolescent. My teenage years were mostly very difficult. I am very grateful for those experiences, but I am glad they are all over with. I was prescribed benzos. Once I turned and abused them after a couple of years, I also abused other drugs for a while. I turned and got sober, and my life has been fucking awesome. Since then, the root of all my troubles is anxiety, which causes me to rapid cycle. A mind in vicious circles is a terrible thing. I spent hours and hours on the anxiety hamster wheel. The noise would just build and build, and I would be terrified, frustrated and very depressed. I am happy to say I have recovered very much from being a nervous wreck. I have a job I love a happy marriage and a life I am proud of. I felt an urge to post some advice for anyone who struggles with this behemoth. These are in order of importance to me, personally, move, just move. Anxiety can be described as restlessness, right? I feel like I have too much energy that it is bursting out of me in ways I cannot control. If I use this energy physically, it cannot bounce around my head anymore. For me, I found therapy with dumbbells. Once I started putting all my fears into my bench press, I felt so much better. This one was night and dayFor me, I have been going to the gym and lifting at least days a week for years, and I have become a new person. I have lost insecurities in the process. But the point was never to look good physically science backs this one up. A cut approach to anxiety. Not that cut confusion for me, this means getting myself off the hamster wheel. Let me show how this works. Practically, I wake up, make breakfast and check my phone. My boss has texted me something that I believe is saying I am doing a bad job. In the past. I would let this spin around my mind all day. Literally, it would come up for weeks or so it could develop for years and become a core belief. I suck at this job applying cut. I challenge my distorted thought. I simply say, how do I know this is true? Is it possible that my boss is not saying that at all? And instead, they are just asking me to do my job in a more effective way? In this process, I do not rapid cycle. Also, my boss is aware. I have an anxiety disorder, and she is incredibly helpful about it. I let important people in my life know that I am an overthinker and prone to anxiety. I say this is often helpful, as I can use my overthinking as an advantage. I am a perfectionist which shows in my work. I also let them know sometimes I will become stressedOver small things that are not issues, so I will often ask them for clarification on topics. I will literally ask my wife, did I upset you earlier? And of the time I did nothing wrong. I am just in my head challenge your thoughts, theanine a very safe, well tolerated supplement. For me personally, it makes my anxiety around easier to manage. That is huge for me, complete what is necessary. Then give yourself permission to enjoy something oftentimes people say to be productive but take breaks so you do not get burned out that does not work for me. I need to sit down and write my week essay in one or two sittings. I need to just finish it. Then I need to clean, get it done, knock out all my obligations. Then when I have a bunch of free time, I think, what do I want to enjoy? I pick something and stick with it. I say out loud, you have permission to enjoy this relax. You have done. Well, time away from the phone, laptop, etc. On my weekends, I only use my cell phone for an hour or so I turn it off and place it under my bed on workdays. I barely use it as well. I found it was horrible for my anxiety, constantly checking it. I hope some of these help, happy face or smiley

Yes to all of these, and a good reminder on the movement. I also use theanine and have found it helpful not in a xanax kind of way, but more subtle. Do you take it when not feeling anxious or just intermittently? Thats what I cannot decide.

Title: Recovering from anxiety, some brief tips that have worked for me over time.
Thread
I was diagnosed with gad and ocd when I was years old. I was basically a trainwreck of an adolescent. My teenage years were mostly very difficult. I am very grateful for those experiences, but I am glad they are all over with. I was prescribed benzos. Once I turned and abused them after a couple of years, I also abused other drugs for a while. I turned and got sober, and my life has been fucking awesome. Since then, the root of all my troubles is anxiety, which causes me to rapid cycle. A mind in vicious circles is a terrible thing. I spent hours and hours on the anxiety hamster wheel. The noise would just build and build, and I would be terrified, frustrated and very depressed. I am happy to say I have recovered very much from being a nervous wreck. I have a job I love a happy marriage and a life I am proud of.

I have severe gad due to the couid restrictions. My gym membership was frozen. That was also the time my anxiety started. Now, I am depressed, also thinking to resume my workouts, although I still have a lot of symptoms like muscle tension, which is making breathing harder, still using ativan, but that stuff is poison, really trying to taper it off. Now does weightlifting really help lowering anxiety? All I have done last months is walking an hour a day.

If you are concerned and you are able to go, then go to a doctor and get checked out. But anxiety can definitely make you feel like that. Try to keep yourself busy and drink lots of water. I wish you the best.

I went to the er times in weeks for sudden chest pain and facial tingling always on one side so I thought I was having a stroke or somethingconfusion saw a cardiologist and everything heart looks good aside from a sinus arrhythmia, which is not normally dangerous. She a doctor who hates when women are told chest pain is just anxiety without further exploration. But she says with all the tests I have taken that seems to be the cause I have never been diagnosed until recently and the chest pain was a brand new symptom. I do have a history of nausea and digestion problems. I do not have it but ibs can be affected by stress, fun factconfusion that made me miss a lot of school, though apparently it is not uncommon for new symptoms to show up. And anxiety can manifest in crazy ways, especially in young adulthood. With all the changes, it could very well be anxiety, but I would get checked out by a doctor just in case for your gastrointestinal problems. As it could be a bug or something, the chest pain sounds like more of an anxiety thing, though, because if it was something like a heart attack, something would have already happened. Sorry to put that bluntly. But that is the line I use to comfort myself. Though I still find it hard to logic my way out of attacks, whatever it is, it is not acute, I still get chest pain attacks seemingly out of the blueSpread out nowconfusion. And I like to remind myself that I have survived it before, which means I should, again, it still scary, but it does help a bit edit to adtongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry.

I have this issue as well. What helped me was changing up my morning routine. I started by getting more sleep and using lights in my room that automatically get gradually brighter. A half hour before my alarm goes off to make waking up less jarring. Then I started taking lion mane with my coffee, which alone almost completely eliminated brain fogconfusion, vitamin and fish oil. Another thing that helped me was turning the shower on cold for a minute or so once I am done showering, it really snaps you into the present. Then, of course, coffee and a full breakfast make a big difference. I would try adding a few things one at a time to your morning routine and see what works for you, but definitely make sure you are getting enough sleep and water

Sounds fairly normal to me, considering how much change you have been through change can certainly be a stressor for your mind and body. It will take a while to adjust to the new medication change, and mornings are when you will feel it most as you transition from rest to wakefulness. When anxiety levels come down, depression and flatness is very common, and brain fog is certainly a well known symptom. Allow yourself some space and time to feel that, and it looks like your moving through. Well, happy face or smiley. Interestingly, the less you think about the brain fog, the less brain fog you get true in my experience anyway.

It could be depression. Some people feel foggy with even mild depression. It might be anxiety, but it is less likely to cause foggy feelings unless you are experiencing derealization as a result of your anxiety or something similar. So unless you are feeling disconnected from yourself, it is probably unlikely to be anxiety tends to make you more awake, since one of its effects can be flooding your body with chemicals like adrenaline. When I wake up with bad anxiety, it is like the one time that I go from asleep to awake, pretty much the moment I open my eyes that more of a common response to anxiety. I may not be able to think clearly if I wake up panicked like that, but it is because of racing thoughts and intrusive thoughts, not fogginess. It could also be a side effect of one or more. If you take more than oneconfusion of your meds, I often wake up a bit fuzzy feeling from a few of my meds, though. To be completely honest, I have always woken up a bit fuzzy. Some of my meds make it worse, thoughconfusion. It generally takes me about an hour on a good day might be two or more on a bad one, but that is usually, when I have had trouble sleepingconfusion. Before I really feel awake, I can usually make the fuzziness go away faster. If I drink a cup or two of coffee or tea. If I am feeling very high anxiety, I doNot like to drink coffee, since it can sometimes make it worse, but tea seems to be ok and sometimes even helps my anxiety. The helping part might be somewhat in my head. My gran used to always make me tea and talk to me when I was upset about stuff, so it is just comforting. It reminds me of her, and she was very comforting and loving to me. Generally speaking, though, the level of caffeine is lower in tea and it has theanine, which is supposed to help with the jitteriness caffeine can cause. I know I can drink tea pretty much all day without getting jittery, so I think there is something to the theanine thing

Totally normal. My anxiety is the worst in the morning. Something about starting a new day and the bright sun coming in through the windows sort of stresses me out. Plus, there is some science to show that cortisol levels, the stress hormoneconfusion peak during the morning. For me, having some sort of routine, totally helps a ton, ideally something that has to do with exercise. But honestly, any sort of routine and structure can be totally helpful. A shower, maybe an episode of to show that your interested in, or a podcast. All of that would help. When I was in high school, I started every day with a shower, then shave, and had youtube videos on whatever subject I was interested in at that point, playing in the background. That routine was just something that I stuck to, even if I did not feel like it, and that did wonders for my morning anxiety.

I literally went over this recently I had a swollen sweat duct and it hurt a lot. Please go to the doctor for peace of mind. I do not know if you shave, but if you do, and especially if you use deodorant that contains antiperspirant aluminum, it is very likely that it is related to this remember that it is normal to feel anxiety related to unknowns and health concerns as this is just your body trying to protect you from harm. This fear is what is going to drive you to go to the doctor and get your lump checked and follow any line of treatment they prescribe to you. This is useful and good and aimed towards self preservation. It can be a simple as hot towel compresses and some medication I know as anxious people. We over focus in the worst case scenario, but more often than not, this is just a small thing. If you notice yourself saying, oh, this can only mean the worst. Just observe your thoughts and thank yourself for trying to stay alive and well. And then remember that you are doing all you can and that there is a big chance this is minor and will go away soon enough.

Title: Anxious when getting any help from family.
Thread
This sounds so minor on the surface, but I am having crippling anxiety over the fact that I am getting help from my uncle. I am currently renting a condo with my wife, and we have our lease coming to an end in a couple of months, my parents reached out to me and mentioned that my uncles rental property is renovated, and he is looking for a new tenant. I said, yes, I am interested. So I spoke to my uncle and he is allowing me to stay at his rental property for a decent rate, probably dollars off market valueconfusion. I am grateful for this opportunity, but I keep having this hesitation that he could potentially be making more if he rented it out to another person. The whole idea of family treatment is giving me bad anxiety. Yes, I am paying money every month, but I still feel a level of guilt, because maybe he could be making more with another tenant. I spoke to my parents, my cousins friends, and they all think I should take the offer, and it is beneficial to both parties. But my own insecurities are coming into effect, and I am having this constant feeling of guilt. I know there might be a underlying issue within myself, but I just wanted to write here to let out my feelings. How can I feel better about this

You are helping your uncle by providing him a guaranteed renter. He also gets the pleasure of helping someone he loves. He still making money, and he knows his loved one is happy. People love you and want to help you out a little. You re not freeloading or taking advantage. He clearly thinks you would be a good tenant, my old landlord, who I was not even related toconfusion, gave me a discount on the rent just for not being a nuisance. You have no reason to feel guilty at all. Let people care about you deserve

Title: Cannot shake this health anxiety, fully convinced I am dying, need opinions.

In the last months, I have had eggs, a chest ray, a full blood test, a neurological exam and a urine test. Everything came back. Perfect. But I still cannot shake this idea that I am dying of something. I have so many weird physical symptoms, abdominal pain, chest pain, flushing of chest, neck, stomach and face, weird pains everywhere, discolored hands, extreme disassociation, extreme panic, attacksconfusionis, there, something I am missing. Should I keep getting looked at? Is it actually all physical anxiety symptoms? This is the worst my mental health has ever been, and I feel like I am being tortured every day, and I am lost. Do not know what to do or where to go. I have no insurance, so I cannot keep affording all these tests. Any advice would help

Try to go to the gym or workout. So something that will keep your mind off those small aches and pains sitting in your home room will not do you much good. Itll make you focus on your aches, and then you will think of something that is causing death if your results are all good, that is a good sign and should be something that helps you. Anxiety can do that to you, causes chest pain, elevated heart rate, shaking hands, etc. If you feel the need to go to the doctors, there is no shame. Make sure you voice your fears, tell them what is worrying you. If they are, say your fine, take their advice

Title: Scared that I might have cancer.
Thread
About weeks ago, I found a slightly swollen lump on the right outside corner of my armpit. It went down over the last few weeks, but yesterday I feel the area and found that the lump had turned very hard like rock hard. The lump is underneath my skin and feels approximately my in diameter. I can move it and get underneath the lump. But what is really concerning me is that its rock hard. I am not sure what it is, and I am scared its cancerous. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

Yes, go to the doctor. But cysts are very common in the armpit area due to deodorant and clogged pores.

Other than the discolored hands, reynauds syndrome, maybe confusion. Those recall common anxiety symptoms unfortunately, get the dare response book by barry mcdonagh. It was a real eye opener for me. Anxiety is hard to tackle, but half the battle is acceptingnthats what it is.

I know how annoying it is to hear you re fine. It is just anxiety, as if to imply you are immune to having an illness because you have a history of anxiety. But it is been months, and it sounds like you have seen a revolving door of doctors who have actually checked you out and did not dismiss your concerns on the basis of anxiety. You are almost certainly fine. All of that sounds like it can be attributed to anxiety. By the way, abdominal and chest pain is very common, and I am having a lot of weird pains myself. Often this is in the form of subjective weakness in my extremities, like my arms and legs. I do not know about the discolored hands thing, but I know sweating palms is also a pretty common symptom of panic attacks.

Drama at work is stressful. I have been amazed how switching jobs drastically improved anxiety. Personally, I avoid getting close with people at work after some bad experiences. Similar to the one you described, people bring their problems with them, and I felt I had enough of those. So work, when you are at work, socialize to a minimum and do the best job you can.

Title: My year with anxiety.
Thread
Hey, all this is my first post in here, and this seems like a pretty supportive sub. I really just need to vent my brain off. A year ago, I had what I can only assume was some sort of mental breakdown. I was extremely anxious and could not eat for about days. I slowly regained my appetite. And thanks to some absolutely unhelpful advice from a walk in clinic doctor about my weight and a prescription for lorazepam, I tried picking up my pieces. I have been dealing with daily, unexplained anxiety and stomach problems ever since got off the lorazepam tried different antidepressants, one of which gave me my first ever suicidal thoughts. So I swiftly got off. Those got rounds of bloodwork, and all came back with no major issues, tried or different therapists, but nothing has really clicked with me. Plus, I cannot really afford to keep trying different psychologists and therapists as my work insurance only covers so much, and therapy rates have damn near doubled, where I am in the past few years. With time, I definitely have come leaps and bounds from where I was february, but I still feel like I cant live my life normally. I cannot watch my favorite shows. Anymore. I cant listen to certain music anymore. Anything that has any bit of violence or depth or heavy emotion I just cannot handle. Its so frustrating I just have so much trouble enjoying what I used to enjoy. Its all a strange physical anxiety thatJust comes out of nowhere tight chest and throat, tension, headache, feeling every heart beat then my brain starts to get anxious because my body is anxious its all one hellish snowball effect and I do not know why its happening or how to fix it. I have been trying to be good to myself, keep lists and journals of positive things in my life. I have been doing steady yoga and exercise, taking vitamins and keeping up on hygiene routines, and that has definitely helped my confidence. I just wish I could stop overthinking and freaking myself out in the moments that mean the most when I am trying to enjoy a night out with friends or having dinner with my wife or just trying to do a hobby I enjoy. It feels like I just really have to fight to achieve any kind of joy. Amp but I just have to keep going. I guess its the only thing I can do. I just hope and pray that with time I can manage this better and maybe ill get out of this. Maybe its some childhood teenage shit I never dealt with or the subconscious stress of the pandemic. I do not know if you have read this far. Thanks for listening. I just felt it was time for me to write this out in words rather than it just cycle in my head day after day. Amp peace and love

Students often are independent thinkers, and there will be students that learn better outside of class, but that is not really the fault of the teacher. I have adhd and anxiety and often space out in classroom settings as well. So it would not exactly be your fault if I did not listen in class.

Sounds like imposter syndrome obviously you have a lot of internal anxiety so seeing others do their work while being chill makes you feel like they have something you don you see it mostly in college.

Title: Did I have a concussion?
Thread
Hi I am a years old male who has had one head impact on the and the of december respectively I do not smoke drink alcohol nor have I been diagnosed with any health problems on the of december I accidentally bumped my head against a corner made of metalconfusion just above the frontal part of my head while I was working in the kitchen at home since I have already been worrying about my brain health prior to the incident because I have been experiencing brain fog since april. I was immediately worried that my symptoms will worsen because I might have just given myself a concussion. I was even googling and was worried specifically about ate due to me having played rugby in high school earlier that dayconfusion. I can remember that immediately after I bumped my head. I felt foggy, tired and I even complained that I felt a bit minimallyconfusion dizzy. I told my girlfriend who is a clinical psychologist and knows that I have health anxietyconfusion about it immediately, and she reassured me that I could not have given myself a concussion from a small bump. After I convinced her to check my pupils, they were equally responsive to lightconfusion. We proceeded to have sex afterwards I was not quite in the mood, but since we were trying to have a child and it was a fertility day for her, we did not want to waste itconfusion, and I felt totally washed out. After the act the next morning I wokeUp and I felt like that mentally I was in a fog though granted I only slept for hoursconfusion and I could not help but to obsessively think about the possibility that I have just permanently injured my brain we visited my girlfriend parents that day and when I was texting with my friend in the car I found it more difficult than usual to understand what I have read, especially jokes which I somehow missed timesconfusion and I also complained that I found it slightly more difficult to formulate sentences it was as if I could not instinctively place different words correctly in a sentence while I was textingconfusion I also had pain on the location of my head that was impacted the day before. Whenever it was touched though no bruise was visible except for the scalp tenderness in the region affected I was and still am unable to tell if the symptoms brain fog. Minimally noticeable dizzinessconfusion that I experienced back then was psychosomatic or physical. Then for next few days after the incident, I was still feeling anxious about a possible concussion and fast forwarding to the of december, I was lying down in bed using my phone and my girlfriend years old child head collided with mine on the same side of my head that bumped against the corner on the while she was moving around next to me the child was not hurt and I do not think that I felt any differently from before immediately after this second incident.I asked my girlfriend to give me a neurological examination according to a medical video that I found on youtube and she said that all of my performances were normal she also gave me the scat and I got a full score on the cognitive screening part of the test for days afterwards however I felt mildly dizzy whenever I turned my head rapidly or if I sat and try to relax on the couch even if I could walk in a straight line by the of january my girlfriend has also told me that she was able to notice that I was unable to pay attention to what she was saying even if I said that I tried she inferred this as evidence that I was even more preoccupied than beforeconfusion I have seen doctors starting from the of january by which point I no longer felt dizzy anymoreconfusion and after clear neurological exams I was told that my symptoms can either be caused by stress and anxiety or that there might have been a concussion doctors said that there might or might not have been a mild concussion though they clarified that it was unlikely while one of them said that it was outright impossible based on the nature of the accidents themselves the one who said that it was impossible also incorrectly told me that a concussion will result in a loss of consciousness he seemed to realise that he made a mistake after I gave him a doubtful look but he insistedThat it could not have been a concussion, nonethelessconfusion. I had an mri of my brain on the and of feburary, and my doctor told me that it was normal right now. I am still feeling slow mentally, and I am still experiencing the same problem with difficulty formulating sentences. For example, it has taken me hours to write this post, which is a much longer time than if I had written something like this a few months ago, because now I would get stuck on my sentences every so often and have to rephraseconfusion. I am also finding it more difficult to understand jokes, to code abstract thoughts into words and to explain my thoughts to others. It should be kept in mind that even though I have been complaining of brain fog since april, it has never affected my ability to read, write or express myself in any way. And I managed to graduate from my university course last august with the grade that I wanted, I have also seen a very experienced neuropsychologist specialised in evaluating and treating brain conditions back in october and november, and I was told that I did not have any brain related ailments, and that my brain fog was anxiety related. I was given sessions of cut, which was discontinued at the end of november. As I left my home country to live with my girlfriend since the incidents in december. Though my cognitive symptoms and admittedly, my preoccupation with themconfusion have been so debilitating that I haveDecided to defer my university course that was supposed to begin in january so I would really like to know whether or not I have indeed suffered a concussion and is now experiencing post concussion syndrome or are my symptoms due to stress anxiety preoccupation this is the corner that my head bumped into on the of december this is the site of my head that was hit I took the picture with a selfie camera so while it might look like that it is on the right in the photo it is my left side that the picture is supposed to showconfusion this was how far my head was from the corner as indicated by the blue arrows this was the site of my head that my girlfriend child head collided with on the of december again I took the picture with a selfie camera so while it might look like that it is on the right in the photo it is my left side that the picture is supposed to showconfusion how likely was there a concussion in the first place and how likely is it that my symptoms difficulty formulating sentences and expressing abstract ideasconfusion are due to it instead of my preoccupation with them? The ominous implications of a concussion
Comments
Ok, so a lot to take in but will try to address it in parts. Firstly, did you have concussion? In my opinion, no, the impacts do not seem to be particularly heavy and especially the and one where the child was not hurt. So it seems incredibly unlikely it did damage to you. I think the second clash is evidence you are hyper monitoring everything that is going on and had you not already been worrying about this, you would not have even considered it to be a problem, but because your thoughts are constantly worrying about your head it set off a trigger you have seen three doctors, and even if two said you may have had concussion, they are clearly not worried about your current health and mri was clean, etc. You have also passed all the cognitive tests, etc. I am almost certain that even if you did have concussion at some point there are no affects from that anymore. I know a lot of people that have had significant concussions and even they are not affected this badly. So long after I am not a doctor, nor do I have any medical knowledge. So I do not want to say for certain, but I just think, given you have seen doctors and been tested by your of, and none of them have found anything wrong, it really seems likely that its more of a psychological issue. Secondly, about the current cognitive effects. I have experience here as I am just recoveringFrom a month period where I thought I damaged my brain and had all these symptoms of brain fog headaches, weird sensations, etc. All I can say is I know how intense and real they are. And this is exactly why we look to pin it on some external cause because we simply cannot believe something so real can be psychological to speak to your symptoms. Specifically the cognitive debilitation is because you are so anxious about your mental and physical state when our mind is so intensely focused on how we feel and how we think and it is worrying about whether we are feeling okay or saying the right things. It takes up so much cognitive focus and hence traps us in our heads and leads to these problems. You are having this brain fog is worse than before, because whereas before it seems like a more generalised anxiety issue, it is now tied to a specific worry that can absorb almost all of your time and thoughts. And so traps you in your head that much more. If you want to start recovering, you must start accepting how you feel and all these horrible effects it is having. This is tough, because I know how debilitating they are. But the fact is they are here. And so what your task has to be is to learn to live with it for now and simply accept that you will feel these things, but you are healthy, your brain is healthy and things will returnTo normal given time. Once you are able to start accepting the feelings, you lose focus on them, you will not feel the need to be monitoring your own mental state. And so you free up your focus to the outside world and start being able to have fuller conversations, understanding jokes, etc. Even if it was concussion, which I do not think it is. The above still applies. We heal both physically and mentally. So either way, it is a case of learning to accept these problems so you can start to lose your focus on them. Essentially, you must be prepared to live your day in spite of them. As time goes on, you will realise that a lot of the negative part of the feelings was not the feeling itself, but the amount you worried about the feeling sorry was a bit of a ramble, but feel free to ask any more questions. I have been in a very similar situation

I have social anxiety. So this feeling is not anything new, but lately, I have been having many mild anxiety attacks throughout the day due to stuff going on with my health. It scary and it feels like I cannot do anything. I have lost my hunger and have no interest in doing anything. How does one sort of cope with this feeling? Especially if you have some sort of illness worrying you?
Comments
You cope by not making it worse. Because you lose your hunger, you need to try and eat more. And earlier, I used to choke down grapes and yogurt drinks. You make sure to drink water, eat and get a good amount of rest. You do not let the dark thoughts spiral. Even if your worst thought were true, it does you no good to entertain and identify with dark thoughts. You just watch them pass by every thought, emotion and feeling is transitory. It will pass. You are none of these things. You are the consciousness aware of them. Your brain will produce thoughts a day, most of them repetitive. You do not have to listen to any of them, and with time, you can send them to you. Junk filter. I am sorry. You are going through health issues recently dealt with a kidney stone for months that really tested what I am telling you can only get checked out and follow doctors recommendations. If there is an issue worrying to the point of not eating is counter productive. If you can get out of your mind and become the awareness, it is quite peaceful. No matter what you are going through,

Constantly being anxious or similar does actually manifest into physical stress over time. If you are stressed or have long periods of anxiety. For extended amounts of time, your body is unknowingly in fight or flight mode, which in turn sends signals to your brain and other parts of your body that eventually start to misfire and cause symptoms like muscle weakness, tingling in hands or feet headaches, fatigue, digestive issues, even more serious side effects, like mystery rashes, vision issues, memory issues and hair loss, high levels of anxiety due to unresolved trauma is harder to overcome. But the first step would be ruling out neurological and physical issues before taking the mental health route happy face or smiley. Good luck. And I hope you find your answers

Title: Social anxiety in class.

Mask optional and social anxiety so my friends and I had agreed that we were going to continue to wear out masks even when mask are optional at my school majority of people therefore will be not wearing masks and I am fine with being the only one wearing a mask in all my classes except english the issue is that nobody in my english class knows me be they are all juniors and I am a senior and they do not know what I look like either I already feel isolated and left out and it is the one class in which wearing a mask would cause me a lot of anxiety probably to the point of panic attacks would I be a bad person if I wore it during anytime except for english class
Comments
You re seeking absolution. And nobody here can give that to you. Wearing a mask does not make you a good person. It not a moral statement. If you want to reduce your chances of getting or making someone else sick, wear the mask if you are not really concerned, do not wear it up to you at this point.

Comments
Many doctors are hesitant to prescribe benzos because of the potential for addiction and dependency. Benzos are supposed to be used like a rescue inhaler only for panic attacks instead of asthma attacks. Popping the pill does nothing to fix the issue that is causing the anxiety only puts a bandaid on your symptoms they re pin or as needed. Usually, asking for it is a red flag. The med your on is somewhat of a diet version of a benzo. Most doctors will try that first or a beta blocker or an antidepressant

Ask your partner what helps them for everyone? It is different. Both my fianc and I struggle with anxiety and had to have a conversation about what was helpful when we were anxious. Turns out that without realizing it, he was trying to help me in the ways he wanted to be helped, and I was helping him in the ways I wanted to be helped. So it was not that effective for each other. Lol, ex, he wants to be left alone. Is I want to be held. He hates being told it will be okay. Is him telling me it will be okay? Is super calming for me, etc. Confusion. So yeah, the best bet is just to have a gentle, honest conversation with you partner and get to know their needs and preferences

One thing I have learned is that anxiety is not something to be fixed in your partner. It is part of who they are and part of why you love them by seeing the anxiety for what it is a situation in your partner head. That is very real for them. It is possible to approach the problem with compassion rather than defensiveness, which has been my default. Compassion will build the relationship. Defensiveness will build emotional scar tissue when your partner learns to trust you, that will have a calming effect on them too. The last thing I would offer from my limited experience is that you need to give yourself permission to have your own anxieties. You cannot just be your partner rock, you are human, too. And by communicating your own concerns, you are creating a communication environment where it is okay to discuss such things

Every morning, I wake up a tired, I go to school, and there I feel, scared and apathic all the time. Here starts the sleeping problem. I take the car from school, and I sleep. When I come home, I eat, take the dog for a walk, then I go back to sleep. Rest. Then it is dinner time, eat, watch, netflix, sleep at it. Obvious that I sleep rest too much. I have had big mood shifts, bad mood and brain fog. I also feel extremely tired all the time, and my life is basically nothing. I do not feel nothing. I just want my life back. I am at a point that I ruined all my relationships. I need a new start, new friends. I nearly finished my school career. I btwconfusion my therapist, when we fist met saitongue, sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry months, and you will be back on track. It been years. Its getting really difficult for me.

At the moment, I was wondering if anybody had any knowledge on if I should or should not pull apart the capsules and take it with food.

Im more concerned about the dosage level and the extended release intention for it. Any advice helps. Thank you.

Thread
I have a very physical manifestation of anxiety. I flinch a lot and feel tingles and tickles and tremble every now and then, without reason. So when the temperature fell this january by to degrees, I start flinching at the touch of anything cold. Since everything was cold in reaction, I started cramping my muscles everywhere. Then these cramps travelled all over my abdomen to weird places to my groin. And what? Not some of them were rather nasty, all from a physical manifestation of anxiety from the cold of winter after suffering for about a week, I did things that solved this dancing, playing with a ball, soccer, basketballconfusion, finally declaring to myself that cold is a friend and actively welcoming everything cold despite discomfort. Now, my system seems to be used to the cold, kind of and no cramps, no shivers, no flinching from the cold hope. This helps someone edit it weird. How, even after you have recovered from decades long symptoms, the neurological aspect of anxiety finds new neural pathways to frighten and bring discomfort to you, effectively causing new chaos. And a relapse

Probably about six months ago, I sent explicit photos of myself to a friend. I had not spoken to him since high school, and he started reaching out. About a year ago, I initially just blew him off because he and I never really spoke, and I would not consider us friends. Eventually he bugged me enough that I gave in and started chatting with him. It was all good fun, and it was nice catching up until he brought up the topic of sex. He initially asked me to be fob and I declined, saying that I was not interested in casual sex, seeing as I have not even had my first keep it simple, stupid. Yet theres no way I am letting my first time with a guy be casual with no feelings. He relented and stopped suggesting fob and instead turned his attention to getting off to pictures of me. I did not want to lose a friend, seeing as I do not have many at all. And I found myself taking and sending photos of myself to him. This, coming after I told him how uncomfortable I was and that I did not want to do it. He kept pressuring and would not stop messaging me on different platforms. He told me I was being selfish, and I genuinely felt like I was wrong for not sending pictures, but I ended up sending some none showing my face and to my knowledge. He did not screenshot them. I felt insanely dirty andDisgusting afterward and I think I fell asleep crying that night now months later it still bothers me he messages me from time to time and tells me about the girls he is slept with and I have been ignoring his conversation since I feel really anxious all the time and it is really affecting my life.

Its okay to say no and stand your ground if you downloaded a dating app, just stand firm in your beliefs and do not feel pressured to do anything for anyone but yourself. There are men out there who are genuinely kind and respectful and will appreciate you and your time.

The way you put it sounds like you made it out sort of safely, but like thats horrible, that he still messages you and especially regarding his sex life, I would be scared to block and get assertive back. So maybe someone else will have advice for that. I wish I knew how to help you feel more safe and confident, but I think you are in the right direction. Understanding the past, I also think you will always feel some doubt for a little bit that might go away with time rewarding experiences. Also, you can maybe ask others, you know, or strangers online, how certain things read or what the situation appears like to others. I get stuck on the pictures, part of dating apps. Personally, I hope you can feel safer as time goes

Title: Weird sensory experiences.
Thread
Hi. I wonder if anyone have these sensory issues that I am dealing with, my eyes seem to constantly be taking in too much light. Whenever I do to a supermarket, it feels weird and slightly overwhelming. If I stand at the end of a aisle of goods, they kind of become a blur. If I put on my yellow tinted glasses, it looks almost normal. I have heard from several sources that anxiety can result in chronic photophopia, or at least that you let in to much light constantly as way of scanning for potential danger. This is constant and is not triggered by being more or less anxious. I recently discovered I have some slight visual snow, and when there is a very sharp light, I can see floaters a little bit. It mostly visible in the dark. I never thought of it before and thought it was all just a part of the same blurry thing. I have other sensory issues as well. That points to this being caused by anxiety, as far as I can tellconfusion, if there is bad acoustics in a room or at a caf or just a lot of people there talking. It feels uncomfortable like I am at an indoor swimming pool or something. I also feel the ground too much through my feet. In some weird way. I have been taking some time off, and I am no longer stressed and only a little bit anxious. If I am just chilling in my apartment, I doNot feel anxious or stressed at allconfusion. I am hoping this will change my situation along with exercise and bunch of other stuff. These are my worst symptoms. It is like the world is just sensory overwhelming. If I go in mcdonalds, all the sounds and lights is just irritating me. I do not really get stressed or anxious anymore, though never have panic attacks. The list of symptoms, besides the sensory stuff, is internal tremors, very mild herd and acid reflux only times per weekconfusion, mild tinnitus, burning skin, weird pains from muscles or joints, almost like burst of lactic acid. I wish every well with their recoveries stay strong. Any answers are greatly appreciated.

Title: Weird sensory experiences.
Thread
Hi. I wonder if anyone have these sensory issues that I am dealing with, my eyes seem to constantly be taking in too much light. Whenever I do to a supermarket, it feels weird and slightly overwhelming. If I stand at the end of a aisle of goods, they kind of become a blur. If I put on my yellow tinted glasses, it looks almost normal. I have heard from several sources that anxiety can result in chronic photophopia, or at least that you let in to much light constantly as way of scanning for potential danger. This is constant and is not triggered by being more or less anxious. I recently discovered I have some slight visual snow, and when there is a very sharp light, I can see floaters a little bit. It mostly visible in the dark. I never thought of it before and thought it was all just a part of the same blurry thing. I have other sensory issues as well. That points to this being caused by anxiety, as far as I can tellconfusion, if there is bad acoustics in a room or at a caf or just a lot of people there talking. It feels uncomfortable like I am at an indoor swimming pool or something. I also feel the ground too much through my feet. In some weird way. I have been taking some time off, and I am no longer stressed and only a little bit anxious. If I am just chilling in my apartment, I doNot feel anxious or stressed at allconfusion. I am hoping this will change my situation along with exercise and bunch of other stuff. These are my worst symptoms. It is like the world is just sensory overwhelming. If I go in mcdonalds, all the sounds and lights is just irritating me. I do not really get stressed or anxious anymore, though never have panic attacks. The list of symptoms, besides the sensory stuff, is internal tremors, very mild herd and acid reflux only times per weekconfusion, mild tinnitus, burning skin, weird pains from muscles or joints, almost like burst of lactic acid. I wish every well with their recoveries stay strong. Any answers are greatly appreciated.

I experience most of these things but I never connected it to my anxiety but after reading this it would make sense if that were the cause, especially the light sensitivity thing its gotten better recently but in the past it is gotten so bad that I felt temporarily blinded and only saw movement to the point I would walk into people and walls and even fall down stairs I just thought it was something wrong with my eyes but it only lasted short periods of time mins topsconfusion and when I went to get them checked they were fine honestly anxiety a pretty scary thing when it manifests into physical symptoms. Thanks for sharing, its been very en lightening bad pun intended lolconfusion

My girlfriend has gad, as do i, and she is very sensitive to bright lights. We have a little hanging lantern in our living room to turn on at night, because even the house lights can overwhelm her. I get tactile sensory issues. Certain textures will make me freak out if I am already feeling more anxious than usual. I think those sorts of things are super normal, with anxiety is I also have floaters in my eyes. They are there all the time. My eye doctor and pop both say it is not cause for concern unless there are also blood pressure issues present.

Title: Life is all about perspective.
Thread
So this is my hot take. Life is just based on someone is perspective. This idea has helped me with my anxiety very recently, and I have seen huge improvements in my self esteem. So I hope this helps others who are struggling to find a solutions to fight their anxiety. May we all find peace in this crazy world together? Happy face, or smiley? I would like to emphasize that I understand that chemical imbalances and, or a very rough childhood, may cause the achievement of overcoming anxiety to be or seem impossible. This is more of just an idea that may help a general population of people dealing with different anxieties that can be acute to mild. So is it wrong to say the life is primarily about perspective. I mean, why does one person have a panic attack when trying to talk to someone? Meconfusion and another flourish in the social opportunity? I feel like we take for granted how much perspective runs our lives. And when we are unconscious to what is actually going on in any given situation, I can only speak from my own experiences. But when I used to try to talk to someone new, first, I would overthink the situation. I would think of all the dumb things I could say I thought the other person was better at communicating than I was. I thought they had it all figured out and that I needed their approval. Now to some, this may sounds ridiculous and to me, deepDown. I knew it may be silly, but that is how low my self esteem was, and still is, to some extent. But the way I am looking at it now is why am I looking for approval from others when I should be looking for approval from myself? First, what I lacked for the longest time is the ability to see that I deserve to be loved and give love. I deserve to be respected and give respect. I deserve to be happy and make others happy, but not because someone else is telling me to, but because it is built into me from birth, just as it is in you. We are all equals in the world, no matter how it looks, how society wants to separate us. We are all on equal footing. That is the big revelation for me. Why would I want to talk down to myself and bring myself down what good does that do to me? I have just been afraid of living. I have been afraid of the unknown, of what other people think. But if I focus more on how I think about myself, then the opinions of others does not sting as much. So maybe try to be kinder to yourself. Speaking negatively to yourself of the time is setting yourself up for failure. Amp I wish you all the best of luck in your journey in life, and I hope this may help anyone who feels slightly lost in this world. Happy face or smiley

I talk about similar ideas a lot in therapy it has been a work in progress to drill into my head that of people do not pay that close attention to you chances are no one is going to remember if you do something you deem as embarrassing or stupid I still randomly think of an embarrassing moment that happened to me like years ago and I would put money down that no one who witnessed it remembers or cares anymore. It is so silly that we look at others for approval. Someone once told me that it is only embarrassing if you chose for it to be embarrassing. I have always had anxiety, but the pandemic and the sudden return to normal life fucked me up for months. I was in the worst mental place my relationship of years ended and he blamed it on me and my mental health. It was much more his fault, but took a low blow to hurt me moreconfusion, and I realized none of my friends wanted to be there when I was not at my best. During this time, my mom told me that I cannot expect other people to love me if I do not love myself at the time I thought that was the worst thing she could possibly say to me. But it really changed my perspective on a lot of things. It made me realize I really need to invest time into my self worth self love and self confidence. Obviously this stuff takesA lot of time but learning to love myself and accept anxiety is a part of me but not something that is my fault has been one of the best decisions of my life

Title: Years without an episode and suddenly experiencing anxiety daily.
Thread
The last time I suffered a panic attack I was years old it was the most intense traumatic experience I have ever had I had suffered from anxiety in my teens but at the time I had no idea what it was I could not really express to my family what was happening so they chalked it up to hormones or being too emotional fast forward to now I had my first big episode since then a couple sundays ago it was so intense that I was nearly immobilized by it. A very intense and physical presence shook me so bad I had to wake my partner up in a panick they calmed me down and I remembered to breath in and out slowly. I wanted to freak out and hyperventilate and cry. I sat at the edge of my bed and breathed for over ten minutes before I started to slowly calm down. But I felt so weak in my legs sweaty in my palms. My eyes were wide and doe like, and my heart rate would peak suddenly and then drop back down again. A few days afterward, it felt like my body had just been through trauma. I was on edge, expecting another attack. I spoke very monotone and felt very withdrawn physically and emotionally. I cut out anything that might exacerbate or trigger anxiety like caffeine sugar, medicine, etc. I would go to work as normal. Everything was okay for about a week until I had my next episode at work. Luckily,It was a saturday shift, and I usually work alone after, but I was hold up in the bathroom having a panic attack and had to force myself to finish out the rest of my shift. It was very difficult and scary. The ride home was even more intense. I just wanted to get home so bad without having to pull off to the side of the highway and cry. I am still unsure what is triggering this anxiety. My home life has been chaotic lately. Money has been an increasing issue as well. On top of losing hours at work and trying to move up to different positions to compensate. I have also started dieting and working out regularly, but I still feel on edge. I am trying everything to make progressive changes in my life, but I feel hindered by this sudden uncertainty that is shown itself in the form of anxiety. I had another episode about an hour ago, just standing in the kitchen, preparing breakfast. Prior to that, I had an anxiety attack. When I got home from work and just sat at the edge of my bed, quietly sobbing. I am not sure what I intended this post to be. I just needed a place to vent, because I do not know what is happening to me

I feel ya. I had anxiety a few years back, it went away and recently came back end of last year, I got couid and thought any body pain was from couid. On top of that, my life has been so busy of me working, and then raising my twins, their crying all night to get out, the crib stresses me out. I also started a veto diet again after new years, and probably making me feel worse because I am getting stomach aches and headaches from eating less, let alone eating no sugar and low carbs. I cut out a lot of stuff out. Recently, I used to vape, and after couid quit vaping, I use to drink coffee and caffeine, zero sugar sodas and quit that for a while, because caffeine can give you anxiety. I stopped my veto diet. I live in wisconsin, and even going from, people with low anxiety, going from hot and cold, can send your body into anxiety. So a lot of factors can play roles. I just calm myself down if I am feeling a bit stressed or if feeling anxious, keep myself busy, I find when I am doing nothing that is when I think the most. And I basically have a office job. So I stay glued to my phone, like, now, lol, I hope your days get better and better. If you ever need someone to talk to you can always message me

Fight or flight can create some weird sensations, makes sense that it is causing stomach issues. Your body is geared up to run or fight, so it does not want to waste resources on digestion or need the toilet at the wrong time and be unable to defend yourself from animals or whatever. That just an assumption. I am no expert. Usually, when I have calmed down a bit, I got to dash to the bathroom first thing. Lao.

This was me after a panic attack I was stuck in fight or flight. What honestly helped me is chamomile tea everyday for a couple of days. Combine that with some reading and exercise. Sometimes I even put on a movie to ground me.

The thought of asking someone out gets my gut all swirly and I have a history of puking during or right after first and second dates. As you can imagine, it has become a bit of an aversion for me. How did I ever do it in my I am in my now and being anxious seems to have grown as I have aged, I have noticed I only actually puke after a date if I had even glass of alcohol one beer, one rum and coke. So I avoided bars for dates, but taking a walk with someone is not as intimate and going for coffee feels like a work meeting or a friend meeting is the coffee date still a good starter date.

Title: Switching from xanax to buspar.
Thread
I have generalized anxiety. Social anxiety sprinkled with panic attacks here and there. I used to take xanax as needed, sometimes twice a day, sometimes zero times a day, depending on my anxietyconfusion. Now my doctor wants me to replace the xanax with buspar. My question is, will buspar be effective if I take on an as needed basis like I did with xanaxconfusion? Or do I need to take it regularly in order for it to be effective? I really prefer taking pills on an as needed basis, versus on a regular basis.

Buspirone is the model of anxiolytics. I would go so far as to say it is kind of weird that it is still making the rounds like it does. The likely reason is because it is not habit forming in the same way as alprazolam or what have you. But speaking frankly and very subjectivelyconfusion, it is pretty garbage. As to your question to feel an effect, you will absolutely need to take it regularly. People reporting noticeable effects taking as needed are likely experiencing some sort of adjacent psychological activation. Call it placebo effect. If you want to, though that is not exactly what is happening, confusion, it is not a bail out drug, as some physicians might call alprazolam something to help you get through a period of intense distress rather quickly. Side note, buspirone can be very activating. Everyone is different. So do not prime yourself. For this to be you. If you work hard enough to convince yourself something is going to happen, it is probably going to happenconfusion. But sleep can be a real struggle, especially in the early days of initiation. There are other, and in my opinion, betterconfusion anxiolytics that still are not benzos. And even within benzos, there are some that are not as for lack of a better term dirty klonopin is one, though, just like the others. If you take it for a significant period of time, and at higher doses, it can be a monster to taper off confusion. I suggest you have that conversationWith your doctor. Don be afraid to advocate for yourself. It is your body and mind.

Title: How do I help someone get over social anxiety?
Thread
In short, I have moved to a new country a couple of weeks ago, and I do not speak, even speak the local language. I randomly met this girl, who is extremely socially overwhelmed. We hang out some times, go out for dinners and talk a bit. She is so overwhelmed that she cannot even order the food in the restaurant or in the bar around the people. Most of the times I ask her some word in the local language and order the food for us. Even tho I am very poor at speaking local language. I think this subreddit might help me getting the ideas. How can I help her getting better at social situations for her sake, it is not normal for her. I do not think she has any friends. Also, I feel like she is been through alot of trauma and family trauma. I need asked anything in detail, because I can imagine it will not be comfortable for her to open up to me as we have only met times, but seems to like me so much that we are planning to hangout more often, because I am so nice to her, and she usually tells me how her days gets so better at the time we meet, because she does not feel anxious or depress around me. It not normal for her being so much dependent on me just after meeting for weeks, she was living in a shitty situation before that. How do I tell her to getBetter and make more friends. She so submissive and the other. We almost had sex. But I distracted the situation because I do not want to take advantage of someone in this situation. I am not a very social talkative person myself as well, but that is by choice, but she not being able to. Event food is something totally different. Last night, I saw her literally shivering while trying to get the bartender attention, because we needed the menu card. So I went ahead and asked for it. In my broken words of the local language, I have any suggestions on how to help someone getting better at social situations without making them feel bad or putting them on spot

Encouraging her to fully exhale, which triggers her rest digest nervous system to kick in. The alternative is fight flight. Your body is working in one or the other mode. Grounding techniques also help me noting colors in the room, counting backwards, etc.

First of all, I would like to apologise because my english is not very good. Is there anyone who is experiencing mostly body anxiety, like you can be completely calm and then al of sudden there is this attack. I do not know if panic or anxiety. I am not afraid of it. But two days after the attack, I am completely drained, and this only happens while driving. Second problem. I cannot workout anymore. I experience post extertional malaise flu, like symptoms, bad headache, light headedness and nauseaconfusion. I do not know what to do anymore. It has gotten so bad that I have stopped working out, even squats kick me out of body balance. I cannot drive normally. I cannot workout. After two years, I have decided to try zoloft, but I do not know. I am afraid that there is something more behind it. Although medical exams did not show anything specific, I feel so alone in this. My friends keep saying that there is fear in me that I should just go after it. But the consequences are just too much. I feel like my body is dying, and I am only years old, sleepy face

All I could do was try to breathe. I am finally physically well, but my brain will not stop focusing on breathing. I cannot read, play, do anything without thinking about breathing. I have not had a single second of peace since I got physically well. I have tried literally everything to try to stop hyper focusing on it, but I cant. So I need someone to help me by talking to me. I know this is weird, but I am an introvert, so I usually do not talk to hardly anyone. What I need is someone to call and talk to me engage me anything to help me concentrate on something else. I know this is weird, but my only other option is to keep knocking myself out with meds or just dying. I know this is a weird request, but I do not know what else to do. Other than overdose, I do not want to die, but I need someone to help me refocus my mind. Please help

It normal for me. I do not even know why it is happening. I start to feel tense, and my heart rate goes up for couple hours months ago. It was staying for days, maybe weeks when you got used to life with anxiety disorder. You do not care or realize your heart rate, if it is not above, even, is completely normal. For anxiety disorder, drink water, consume less salt and do not take caffeine. It can happen after you eat too.

Soo. I felt the same way and had anxiety about taking medication. I just started buspar about a month ago, and I have gone from extreme anxiety to it only happening here and there. I felt so silly, because this medication has literally changed my life. My doctor also thought I was depressed, but I think my depression was stemming from being anxious. Constantly, I would really suggest seeking help with medication.

Hi. I had the same issues for months after some issues with alcohol dependency. I was in a depressive episode and stuck in fight or flight for months, and it took me a while to get to where I am now. I refused medication also, and now I feel okay compared to how I used to be. If you want anyone to talk to or advice, you can talk to me. Its so frustrating.

My do prescribed me with anxiety and still gave me a re. Even though I said I didnt want one, I never filled it. I stopped drinking any and all alcohol and started meditating nothing wrong with prescriptions. It just wasnt the route I wanted to take. You can try other avenues, and if they arent working, then maybe consider a prescription or seeing a naturopath who can maybe help with some alternative medicines.

Please note that I am not a doctor, let alone a psychiatrist, and these are based on my own understandings. They may be incorrect. So please double check my facts if something seems off. So the idea it makes things worse is probably tied up with the fact that suicide is a side effect of a lot of those medications. But the thing is that they do not cause suicide or suicidal thoughts. Generally, anti depressants, anti anxiety meds, they re actually the same from what I understand. How it manifests just depends on the personconfusion, just cause things to become easier to do because it takes a while for you to feel better. And most people who get on medication are at a pretty low point, suddenly have the energy to do what they have been thinking about. They can make you feel worse if you are on the wrong medication, but there are a lot of medications, and it can take some trial and error to get the right one, but the right one will make you feel better even if it is not perfect. The fire burn analogy someone used above is very true. I can attest, though, as someone who has been on lexapro for about years now, it really does help. I went from crippled with anxiety all day and unable to move forward with life and destroying my best relationship to holding onto a steady job and considering putting myself back out on the dating market if your main concernIs that they make things worse. I would try. It may be that zoloft is not the right medication for you and that you do feel worse, but there are a lot of different medications out there, and they are worth trying.

Once my doctor and I were satisfied that my doses of lamotrigine and paroxetine were at the right level, I made more progress in a couple of months than I had in thirty plus years prior. I have since changed from paroxetine to vortioxetine, which I heartily recommend. The latter has a far better effect to side effect ratio. In my opinion, I do not want to take medications either. I have physical conditions for which I have to take medications including one that has to be injected. But I have always looked at it in terms of benefits after the benefits of the medications I take for generalised anxiety disorder. I would never stop taking them not unless a doctor told me it was in my interests to stop anyway.

You cannot treat the burns until the fire is out. For me, the meds deal with the fire, so I can talk about the burns in therapy. For me, they both need to happen for either to work well.

Omg I feel seen I would be able to talk about something in depth with a close friend or even have strong opinions about something, but as soon as I am asked about it in a group or by someone, I do not know that well, my mind goes blank I start stumbling over my words and I literally cannot think I have two degrees. Yet people always think I am clueless and lost because I cannot communicate my knowledge and often just come across as head empty sigh. I feel like my inability to communicate my knowledge and thoughts will continually stop me from achieving my potential. Be people think I am less capable than I actually am. It sucks

Title: I regret sending him anything. Its all I can think about.
Thread
Probably about six months ago, I sent explicit photos of myself to a friend. I had not spoken to him since high school, and he started reaching out. About a year ago, I initially just blew him off because he and I never really spoke, and I would not consider us friends. Eventually he bugged me enough that I gave in and started chatting with him. It was all good fun, and it was nice catching up until he brought up the topic of sex. He initially asked me to be fob and I declined, saying that I was not interested in casual sex, seeing as I have not even had my first keep it simple, stupid. Yet theres no way I am letting my first time with a guy be casual with no feelings. He relented and stopped suggesting fob and instead turned his attention to getting off to pictures of me. I did not want to lose a friend, seeing as I do not have many at all. And I found myself taking and sending photos of myself to him. This, coming after I told him how uncomfortable I was and that I did not want to do it. He kept pressuring and would not stop messaging me on different platforms. He told me I was being selfish, and I genuinely felt like I was wrong for not sending pictures, but I ended up sending some none showing my face and to my knowledge. He did not screenshot them. I felt insanely dirty andDisgusting afterward and I think I fell asleep crying that night now months later it still bothers me he messages me from time to time and tells me about the girls he is slept with and I have been ignoring his conversation since I feel really anxious all the time and it is really affecting my life. I am too scared to date now as I fear meeting another guy like him, I am a very gullible person and I am far too trusting. I am also scared a guy will just want to take my virginity and leave as I am sure that is what my friend was trying to do. I just do not know what to do to get over the intense anxiety I am feeling when I even think about signing up for a dating app.
Comments
Ok, cut this guy off. He is not helping your mental health the sooner you can forget about this guy and move on the better you will feel. Many women send photos to men do not feel guilty or ashamed. I think it is a very normal thing to do. You can protect yourself from getting hurt all you like, but you are also preventing yourself from the chance to experience something special. Its worth the risk. Every relationship is a learning curve. There will be people who hurt you, but there will also be people who will love you unconditionally. I never regret any relationships because they made me who I am today. They helped me figure out what to avoid and what to look for in a guy. Even the worst relationships had good times and lots of experiences. You do not have to join a dating app. You will meet people along the way in life if it is more comfortable for you, let it happen organically. Rather than forcing it, you will meet your guy, I promise, happy face or smiley

All the time. The bad coping mechanism for this I use is to imagine conversations of all kinds and practice their responses. This is effectively a sub category of the disorder, but I am prepared for literally every common outcome, because goddammit, I rehearsed it ten times. This is definitely not healthy, because fear makes me imagine all kinds of worst case scenarios. The good way is to realise that not everyone is in a tearing life or death hurry as we are. Fight or flight response. Remember confusion? So people accept and even appreciate it. If you think for a second or two and reply one sec, let me think, has helped me in so many conversations. Most people in civilised society are trained to accept a gentle request with a moment of patience, and therefore, when you ask nicely, they will happily give you a moment to think out your response. It also helps to anticipate upcoming conversations, which is the milder, more reasonable form of the overthinking alternative, described as the first optionconfusion in social circumstances. For longer conversations, it is very useful to be known as the person who thinks well before they reply. Heck, even being known as slightly slow, but steady is better than being in a tearing mad rush and confused and embarrassed all the time. Literally, anything is better than the haste of anxiety.

I feel like because of my anxiety I assume I am already dumb and that makes me question a lot of things I want to say like back when I was in school, I was so afraid to be called on but most of the time I would have had the correct answer or now in my working life there are questions I avoid asking for fear of sounding stupid or comments I avoid making because I am afraid of being wrong even just in casual conversation there are things I want to say, but I am afraid of sounding stupid. So I say nothing instead

Oh, I know I am dumber between the multiple concussions and the resulting alcohol use. I am considerably dumber than I was while in schooling. My brain injuries have really impacted my life, and I am way dumber than I used to be. I still read tons, but I do not learn at much. Getting hit on the head repeatedly has really fucked me over. It could be worse. The dumbest guy I know got into a motorcycle accident, and he thinks, shitting in a bucket and pissing is the woods is normal. He randomly show up at my house at am break in to my garage and mow my lawn. I still feel like I am smarter than the average asshole. Even with this acknowledged brain damaged, I am way more intelligent than the average person. It would take a few more traumatic brain injuries to make me as dumb as an average person.

Definitely it bothers me alot too, because I feel like I learn all these cool things and actively try to gain as much knowledge as I can. But when it comes to verbally express that knowledge, I go blank. And it takes me ages of thinking to actually get it out. The main thing ive realised, though, is the thought that you are sounding dumb often isnt necessarily true, and just a byproduct of your anxiety it all feeds into each other. Practice makes perfect

Omg yes, youre not dumber though your brain cannot do other things when it is in. Got to find safety mode, like, if you were in a fire, you would not expect your brain to do normal things. You would expect it to focus on safety, right? And brain fog is a real thing.

Yes, this is the single biggest frustration I have with my anxiety I always have so much that I want to say, but my anxiety makes me spit out a bunch of word salad, which makes me even more anxious in the future. It is a viscous cycle.

Absolutely I overthink and beat myself up for most of the things I do. Maybe they do not seem that terrible embarrassing to other people, but I exaggerate them in my head and I get overwhelmed thinking about them. It really hard to stop a thinking pattern like this.

Hell, yea! The brain fog I get from overthinking too much. And being generally indecisive makes me come off as a dunce in public. Sometimes one story I have is I had jury duty a few weeks ago. I walk into the courthouse and they make you empty your pockets into a bin and retrieve your items on the other side of the counter for some reason. I thought they were holding your stuff until you leave. So I walk off and the guard had to chase me down. I was anxious as hell about jury duty, and that mishap was likely because of my anxiety. I was not thinking straight

I believe anxiety makes me dumb, useless and weird. I am unable to even go out and unlock our house gate. If someone is knocking, I fear having to talk to the person. I am extremely uncomfortable around my relatives. I simply have no connection with them. Eye contact is super hard to make. Eventually, all of them stop talking to me after figuring my weirdness out. Recently, one of them stopped looking at me and started laughing at my cringeworthy actions. I am dead nervous around girls never had any intimate relationships. This has literally blown my chances at having a girlfriend. One girl was literally giving me stares at my last job. She would keep staring as if she was ready right there. But I was so nervous that I probably ended up killing her interest. Another had asked me at a club if I would like to have a walk with her at nearby beach. I fucked up and ended up going home. Instead, I did not go to that club willingly. My office team had forced me toconfusion. Another girl was using her laptop when I entered the room, she looked back. When my bag hit the door. Minutes later, I went outside and sat there. The girl came out with a packet of chips and stood next to me to offer them. She was interested, but I am a moron, and I failed to respond. Everyday things involving strangers scare me. I never send my family women alone in cabs wheneverI have to get some repair done to mobile, laptop, plumbing, etc. Confusion. I fear being overcharged many times. I end up skipping the repair work in fear that they will charge more than they should. A lot more to say. But I hope you get the picture.
