Title: Girlfriend is depressed after an abortion.
Thread
Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

Me I was about to be homeless. I could not even afford my basic needs even with my job. So I did what I had to. I always wanted a baby and I was at the right age that I always wanted one. The process pills was incredibly painful, worst pain I have ever felt I was sick for about a week after the depression will be forever when it was a baby you would have wanted to keep if you would been able almost years and a baby later and I still get sad and wonder what and who the baby would have been. It did get a lot better after having my little boy, but it will never go away.

I live in canada, and my partner works at a women hospital that provides specific counseling, focusing on helping women pre and post abortion. Perhaps there is something similar in your area.

Op future you is looking out for you and her right now mine was years ago it was absolutely the right decision but that does not mean that I do not think of the what ifs every now and then we were in a very similar situation kind of feel like I am in a time warp to be honestconfusion the best way you can honor this decision and her is to be there let her talk about it make sure she does not have any added guilt and worship the ground she walks on her journey is much different than yours will be and she needs to know that she is absolutely loved and cherished what she did she did out of love and logic but the scar will last forever its will not always be a scar of regret or shame but it will be a scar of could have beens I cannot even imagine the life we would have ended up with had we continued it would have sucked for everyone involved for what it is worth we have been together ever since then, got married a few years after post collegeconfusion and have kids that we planned for and they are amazing most of the time and we are at the point in our lives where we play the oh man we could almost be done with this parenting ish game its not regret it is just a what if its the path your life did not take and there will bePlenty more of them. Just love her with your whole self and itl be okay. Hormones are wild and therapy or counseling is available if she has a history of depression, just keep an eye out for it, because postpartum is a bear, and sometimes you need meds to knock it back into place.

It really starts with ceremony saying goodbye and not trying to shove feelings down inside. Let her know that you honor this little cluster of cells by saying goodbye in a real way. Also, you cannot underestimate the severe hormonal fluctuations her body is going through, which cause significant emotional rollercoasters as well as physical. The best advice I have heard is to continue caring for your body. Similar to pregnancy taking vitamins getting enough rest, getting quality food. The urge to go back to normal pre pregnancy shows up, but you have to care about your body. There is no normal for awhile, as it can take weeks or even a couple of menstrual cycles for her hormones to go back to the levels and frequency they were pre pregnancy

Just to add she is feeling even more depressed right now because of all the pregnancy and abortion pill hormones racing round her body, she will start to feel a bit better within a couple of weeks in my view, though no one can really say how this loss will have affected her on a personal level.

I suggest you both get some therapy. She absolutely is grieving the loss of a family member, her child. Whether you are pro choice or life, the abortion terminated your child.

Honestly, its going to take a while a lot of women, even ardently pro choice women struggle after having an abortion. It can take months or years to fully move on. I would recommend she look for a therapist. There are also a lot of support groups for people who have had abortions. This is of course not to say that abortion is bad. It is necessary healthcare, while some people may be just fine in a few days, others will struggle. There is no right or wrong way to feel.

Its normal for her to feel like this even being pro choice. The do who performed mine told me to remind myself why I have made this choice and try not to forget that its still not an easy choice for most people to make, but you both made the best one you could for the circumstances you are in. Be there for her. If all she wants to do is stay in and watch movies and hibernate do that with her. Encourage therapy. If she has that option and encourage her to focus on goals she would like to achieve in the near future. That one really helped me things like getting a car, a job, making new friends, exploring new places, etc.

I had to break off my pregnancy due to an illness that will cause much pain through life. We did not want that pain for our baby. It took me about months to be able to go to work again, and I am still not fully there. Give her time and love. Talk about it and let her find peace with the situation.

Post parfum depression also happens after abortion. As the hormones return to normal, things will likely improve.

I felt extremely depressed after having an abortion, even though logically, I knew it was the right choice for years. It weighed on me until I had a baby. I was so scared that I may have aborted my only chance, especially after my abortion went wrong, and I ended up in hospital for a second surgery. It was a very traumatic experience.

An abortion is also very hard on a woman body regarding hormones, so it may take a while until she is fully back to normal, and she will probably need some time to grief too. My advice would be to just continue how you are doing. Now, it sounds like you are doing great pamper her. Let her know that she is loved, cuddle her stuff like that. It will help her through the rough time. Another option that would probably be beneficial for her may be therapy.

I went through the same thing in was just about to start my masters course had not been with my boyfriend that long had no money and a part time cash in hand job I wanted a baby desperately but I was not ready for it looking back boyfriend at the time was not nice to me about it if I am totally honest and I had the abortion I am pro choice but it left me feeling numb and exacerbated my mental health problems I suffered for a few years afterwards and because he was not ready to talk about it which I do understand it eventually killed our relationship however I am glad that I did not have the child I think about what could have been a lot and sometimes I am sad about it but that child would have had a terrible start in life now I have a reasonable income a house as of this week confusion a new loving partner and I am far more mature I was barely an adult in and now I am much closer to if it happened to me again I would be ready and be able to give the child the love and security it deserves I look forward to being a parent now two years ago I still would not have been able to see things this clearly counselling and the kindness and love of the people I know have really helped I have also spent time working on myself and becoming aMore stable and happy person. I really empathise with you both, and I hope you can work together through this to feel better about your decision. It really hard but you will get there and you have made the right choice for yourselves right now. Sorry for the pain your girlfriend and yourself are going through. It gets better.

I did not have an abortion, but I did miscarry. There is no way to explain what it is like to have life growing inside you, just for it to die, its natural to become attached. And so many women who have abortions or miscarry end up having depression. Please get her into counselling. If you can, she needs help, letting go of the guilt.

It only happened a couple of days ago. Shes most likely still bleeding quite heavily and will continue to do so for about weeks. Give her a damn minute. Of course, she feels shit, its still happening. Dont even try to make her get over it while it is still happening. Unfortunately, your politics will not protect your feelings in these scenarios. Therapy is a great option, maybe in a few weeks or months, but let her process properly and feel her feelings and do not rush her. Its an incredibly visually and physically traumatic experience for her to have gone through. And like most medical professionals dealing with women, she was probably not told the full story about how gory an experience it would be. Just be there. Once it is done, you simply being there will have done more than, you know,

For anyone reading this who may be pro life. I want you to read this and remember that absolutely nobody who needs an abortion is ever thrilled about it. That being saitongue, sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry, give her time. Its a lot to process, even if she is okay with her choice. I had a friend who got an abortion because she found out the babys father who she had broken up withconfusion was involved in some unsavory things, and people were threatening her, had the circumstances been different, she would have kept it. She did not want an abortion. She felt like she had to. I am sure that your girlfriend feels the same way its something that is going to stay with her. Grief is a tricky sob. Just continue to be supportive. Give her time, let her talk about it if she needs to and do not force her to. If she does not want to. Aside from the emotional trauma, the physical aspect is horrifying. Its like getting her period on steroids. Its unimaginable pain and feeling gross. Shes going through a lot. Be there for her. No conditions or exceptions.

Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

I had a friend go through this. I think it is important to understand the gravity of the situation. In my eyes. There is always going to be a close to equal sized, negative, compared to the positive. With most life decisions, you were both able to avoid something that could have cause a lot of issues for both of you for a very large portion of your life, but on the other hand, you will probably deal with what you are feeling now. Its a natural part of life. Everything comes with pros and cons.

I know a few women who have had abortions in the past, and it almost always screws them up for a while, couldnt say if it was forever, if they eventually hid it well or actually moved on, though hopefully she moves on. But I would do my best to be supportive right now.

It could honestly take her years until she feels completely back to her old self, all of those extra hormones and she could have postpartum. I would suggest seeing the counselor on campus and go from there. Stay strong. She really needs you.

Dude, your expectation is part of the problem. She got pregnant and her hormones swung wildly one way. Then she took the abortion pills, causing a huge swing of more but different hormones. She going to have physical effects for at least a week, likely maybe more. Think the worst period she ever had then multiple that by several times, you need to be sucking up and doing whatever she needs for the next days after that, you can complain, but only to yourself do not let her catch you. It going to be hard and you need to reset your expectation.

Just be there for her and make life a little easier. Get her some chocolates and food and a blanket and some movies she enjoys. Don make it a light thing, but do not keep asking if she is ok about it. Just be there. Tell her you are there for her and make life easier for her.

I had an a abortion when I was my relationship with my of at the time was abusive and toxic and we were not financially stable at all I also underestimated how awful I would feel after was grieving for a really long time as it was happening it was like I was not thinking anything at all but tears were just dropping out of my eyes and I could not think or talk for a while after it you literally feel it leave and realise that you could feel it while it was there just a really awful experience and was so depressing me and my new partner have an amazing loving relationship and I am months pregnant its still sad to think about the fact I would have a year old right now and still have a place in my heart for my unborn baby but I do still feel like it was the right choice even though at the time I regretted it. Lots of affection and love and listening and understanding will go a loong way, just being there and understanding that she might be sad for a while. I stayed at my mums for a couple of weeks with my of and she got me lots of snacks and treats for movie nights and it was just really good to be with my mum. It only took me a couple of weeks to get back to feeling a bit better. I also had to go and work in a daycare afterConfusion but if she has your support, it will be a lot more than I had and she will be able to move past the intense grieving, eventually sending lots of love to you both grimacing face beating heart

It a hard decision to make the pills really mess with your hormones and on top of the pain, she is miserable and will be for a couple of weeks. Just let the time pass.

Title: My confusion, boyfriend confusion hired his childhood friend confusion as his maid personal assistant.
Thread
My boyfriend and I have been together for years. Our relationship is great, and we have experienced a lot of great times together. We both are very career driven and live separately because it is more convenient because of work. I do stay over a lot at his house, but like to keep my apartment as my own personal space eventhough, we are both pretty busy. We always manage to make time for eachother. My boyfriend works at a law firm and started his own business last year. So he does not really have much free time since the start of the pandemic. He has been working from home, and he usually likes to spend the free time he does have hanging out with me or going to the gym. This pretty much leaves him very little time to do any house work or cook, so he pretty much orders food daily from a couple of local places and cleans his house. Once a week, he has talked to me about hiring a personal assistant who pretty much does everything he does not have time to do. They would basically cook clean, do his laundry, go grocery shopping and run errands for him. This way he would be able to live healthier and better, since he would not be eating take out every night, and his house would be clean and presentable. He has a childhood friend who I have pretty much known since the start of our relationship. They are pretty close friends since theyHave known eachother for over years. She is great and we like to hang out all together. She has helped him through some struggles he had when he was younger, so they trust eachother a lot. The friend has recently been going through a rough time. She broke up with her longterm boyfriend, who she lived with and also lost her job. She lives in her own apartment now, but is having a hard time financially to help her out. My boyfriend asked her if she wanted to work for him as his assistant maid, untill, she found a stable job. I had no problem with this because she also was there for him when he was struggling, and I want her to be in a better position. She accepted the offer. She has been working for my boyfriend for about a month. He pays her good, she does her job well, and objectively, the situation has been great. But somehow, over the past month, I have started feeling weird about this whole arrangement, and kind of built up some jealousy. I guess she works days a week for him and does everything she cooks, makes meal preps for the days she does not work cleans, does his laundry and his grocery shopping picks up packages for him. She is still a friend, so my boyfriend is still pretty informal with her. Since he works from home, they pretty much spend a lot of time together. The days she works and cooks, she joins him orUs, depending if I am able to come over that dayconfusion for dinner. He also lets her drive his car to run errands. I know she is working for him, and she is getting paid, but it still feels weird that she is doing all these personal things for him cooking, doing his laundry and other things to take care of him, almost being a wife. I feel like those are things I want to do for him. I want to take care of him like this, and I feel weird that another woman is doing. It has been nicer for our relationship since his house is now nicer, and he can spend all the time he does have with me. My friendship with her is still great, and nothing has changed. I just have this weird territorial feeling over my boyfriend, my boyfriend and I are both very mature, and we trust eachother, and normally I would think that something like this would not bother me. But somehow, now I feel weird. I have not really talked with my boyfriend about this, because I do not want to come over as insecure and controlling. How can I deal with this situation in a mature and rational way without letting my emotions get the best of me?

You are articulate and realize it is irrational. So you are doing pretty good talk when you both have time, and no one is emotionally worked up. Mate jealousy is pretty normal and it is good. You are cognizant of what is going on.

My boyfriend works at a law firm and started his own business last year. So he does not really have much free time since the start of the pandemic. He has been working from home, and he usually likes to spend the free time he does have hanging out with me or going to the gym. This pretty much leaves him very little time to do any house work or cook, so he pretty much orders food daily from a couple of local places and cleans his house. Once a week, he has talked to me about hiring a personal assistant who pretty much does everything he does not have time to do. They would basically cook clean, do his laundry, go grocery shopping and run errands for him. This way he would be able to live healthier and better, since he would not be eating take out every night, and his house would be clean and presentable. He has a childhood friend who I have pretty much known since the start of our relationship. They are pretty close friends since theyHave known eachother for over years. She is great and we like to hang out all together. She has helped him through some struggles he had when he was younger, so they trust eachother a lot. The friend has recently been going through a rough time. She broke up with her longterm boyfriend, who she lived with and also lost her job. She lives in her own apartment now, but is having a hard time financially to help her out. My boyfriend asked her if she wanted to work for him as his assistant maid, untill, she found a stable job. I had no problem with this because she also was there for him when he was struggling, and I want her to be in a better position. She accepted the offer. She has been working for my boyfriend for about a month. He pays her good, she does her job well, and objectively, the situation has been great. But somehow, over the past month, I have started feeling weird about this whole arrangement, and kind of built up some jealousy. I guess she works days a week for him and does everything she cooks, makes meal preps for the days she does not work cleans, does his laundry and his grocery shopping picks up packages for him. She is still a friend, so my boyfriend is still pretty informal with her. Since he works from home, they pretty much spend a lot of time together. The days she works and cooks, she joins him orUs, depending if I am able to come over that dayconfusion for dinner. He also lets her drive his car to run errands. I know she is working for him, and she is getting paid, but it still feels weird that she is doing all these personal things for him cooking, doing his laundry and other things to take care of him, almost being a wife. I feel like those are things I want to do for him. I want to take care of him like this, and I feel weird that another woman is doing. It has been nicer for our relationship since his house is now nicer, and he can spend all the time he does have with me. My friendship with her is still great, and nothing has changed. I just have this weird territorial feeling over my boyfriend, my boyfriend and I are both very mature, and we trust eachother, and normally I would think that something like this would not bother me. But somehow, now I feel weird. I have not really talked with my boyfriend about this, because I do not want to come over as insecure and controlling. How can I deal with this situation in a mature and rational way without letting my emotions get the best of me?

Your both career driven people. He doing the perfect move, helping a close, trusted friend, while also making home life better and freeing up personal time to be with. You could take over her position at the cost of your career, her new income, and probably put stress on your relationship. Going from a few days a week together to almost might not be a good move. Give it time, and do not think that he is going to cheat.

If this is your gut telling you somethings off, listen to it. Shes a friend, not some stranger, he is paying to help. Shes replacing you and getting paid for it. I do not know if she sees it that way, but if you do, you need to bring it up to him. The way your wrote it in here is pretty mature. And if he knows you have a good relationship, then I do not think he will think you are insecure. If he is not hiding anything, he should not get mad or call you insecure.

Years together and living separately sounds crazy to me but to each their own I get where you are coming from emotionally, but it is a consequence of not living together maybe you have been too busy to cook for him and he has no time to clean, but it would be different if you guys came home to each other my boyfriend usually cooks, but lately he is been too busy. It still nice to at least come home to each other and figure out what is for dinner. You should definitely talk to him then hopefully come up with a plan. But the way I see it is you cannot take care of someone if you are not living with them is living separately strictly because of work or is anything holding you guys back? This sounds like one of those things where you are choosing your career over your relationship, and that is fine. You should not stop your professional endeavors because you are in love with someone, but you also have to bend a little keeping your apartment as your own personal place sounds a little not good, especially since you spend a lot of time at his place anyway.

She is still a friend, so my boyfriend is still pretty informal with her. Since he works from home, they pretty much spend a lot of time together.

I know she is working for him, and she is getting paid, but it still feels weird that she is doing all these personal things for him cooking, doing his laundry and other things to take care of him, almost being a wife. I feel like those are things I want to do for him. I want to take care of him like this, and I feel weird that another woman is doing. It has been nicer for our relationship since his house is now nicer, and he can spend all the time he does have with me. My friendship with her is still great, and nothing has changed. I just have this weird territorial feeling over my boyfriend, my boyfriend and I are both very mature, and we trust eachother, and normally I would think that something like this would not bother me.

Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby.

I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

Title: My confusion, boyfriend confusion hired his childhood friend confusion as his maid personal assistant.
Thread
My boyfriend and I have been together for years. Our relationship is great, and we have experienced a lot of great times together. We both are very career driven and live separately because it is more convenient because of work. I do stay over a lot at his house, but like to keep my apartment as my own personal space eventhough, we are both pretty busy. We always manage to make time for eachother. My boyfriend works at a law firm and started his own business last year. So he does not really have much free time since the start of the pandemic. He has been working from home, and he usually likes to spend the free time he does have hanging out with me or going to the gym. This pretty much leaves him very little time to do any house work or cook, so he pretty much orders food daily from a couple of local places and cleans his house. Once a week, he has talked to me about hiring a personal assistant who pretty much does everything he does not have time to do. They would basically cook clean, do his laundry, go grocery shopping and run errands for him. This way he would be able to live healthier and better, since he would not be eating take out every night, and his house would be clean and presentable. He has a childhood friend who I have pretty much known since the start of our relationship. They are pretty close friends since theyHave known eachother for over years. She is great and we like to hang out all together. She has helped him through some struggles he had when he was younger, so they trust eachother a lot. The friend has recently been going through a rough time. She broke up with her longterm boyfriend, who she lived with and also lost her job. She lives in her own apartment now, but is having a hard time financially to help her out. My boyfriend asked her if she wanted to work for him as his assistant maid, untill, she found a stable job. I had no problem with this because she also was there for him when he was struggling, and I want her to be in a better position. She accepted the offer. She has been working for my boyfriend for about a month. He pays her good, she does her job well, and objectively, the situation has been great.

This is normal even for people that are pro choice you are doing great at helping her but definitely look into both of you getting therapy it is not an easy thing to deal with, especially alone.

I had a miscarriage, and it is a horrible thing to go through. I did not even know I was pregnant. I was around months. It still sucks. Your hormones are messed up and your mind is in the what if stages? It does not matter if you want or do not want the baby. We are biologically made to reproduce it for the survival of our species. Give her some time pamper her. Be there for her. So she knows she is not alone.

Op I do not know if this will help you any, but I had an abortion over years ago, I am very much pro choice, as was my boyfriend at the time and all my friends and family. I am also the type to follow my head over my heart. With most things, I like facts and figures and logic. I cannot put into words the absolute whirlwind of emotions that followed my termination. I was a wreck. For the best part of a year, I suffered depression and ended up on antidepressants and having counselling sessions. I am still trying to reconcile my feelings. Now I know that factually, I made the right choice. My boyfriend at the time was a massive ah, I was only years old. I was in my first year of university. I knew I was not ready for a child in my life. In fact, in the years that followed, I realised I do not even want to have a child at all. But my emotions were still all over the place. I was grieving, my body and my heart knew I would suffered an ineffable loss. I know it was the right choice for me, but it certainly was not a nice choice. Like all losses, time eases the pain it will take time, it will take good days and bad days, plenty of tears and sadness, but you will get there I highly recommend a book called the healing. Choice. It is sort of a diary as well.As a book and it asks the reader questions along the way I found it helpful and I still have it now.

Its normal and common. And for her, she is grieving. A lost family member. When you are pregnant, your body is pumped full of hormones to make our monkey brains love and take care of that baby, and now it is screaming at her. It is extremely unusual for things to just go back to normal after a few days. Weeks is more typical, but some women have severe post parfum depression that lasts months. This will take time and love. Really look into grief therapy, or a support group. There has to be something available in a college setting. Encourage her to follow up with her ob gyn and really talk about it. If they are supportive, just empathize and respect that she has gone through something profound here and do what you can to support her

Just understand her grief process is valid. Sometimes the right choice is not the easy choice I am pro choice. It does not mean you want to have one or will not grieve. Most colleges have a few free counseling sessions. Go to student life and ask about it. Mine had free sessions, but you have to find it and schedule it. She needs to talk to someone. Maybe just be there. Let her cry. Let her feel empathize. Everyone processes this in their own timeline.

This common, especially for people who actually want children in the future but in their current situation. Shouldn it common to be depressed for quite a while? It can be a lot easier for men in a way because they are not the ones going through the motions of pregnancy and then making the decision to end something inside of you give her time, be supportive. Encourage therapy for both of you. It not an easy time.

Being pro choice does not mean it is an easy choice. Its one that is an important one that you are able to make is all she is grieving, as I am sure you are, and has hormones surging. It is a loss its ok and normal and right to feel conflicted and wonder about the life that could have been that does not mean you did not both make the right decision. It is not always an easy one. Keep doing what you are doing, whether they seem to be working or not, is not as important as her. Knowing you are there for her and working through this together. Just be there for each other

Op no matter how you do it, no matter the stage, abortion will always take its toll on a person. Thats one thing that people dont talk about when it comes to this topic, the after math of it mentally getting to you at the end of the day, what is done is done, and I dont mean to sound cruel when I say it. But here are some of the things a very strong professor of mine told our class who had done it herself when she was in college, it will hurt, and you will hurt for awhile. If you have a support system, stick to them like glue. You and your girlfriend seem to be pretty close, and kudos to you for sticking by her. Not many boyfriends who are there to witness abortion or even speak of it stick around. Very long be each others rock it. A very scary time for you guys, especially for her body is going thru the sudden change of no longer having life inside her. So her emotions and her body chemicals will cause her to go sideways, treasure her that there was no harm done if she wasnt that far into the pregnancy, reassure her that you also supported this in order to build a bigger and better future. Not just for you, but for the family you hope to have. One day. And this one I always will remember what my professor saitongue, sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry better to beSelfish than cruel to follow what society expects you to be. Yes, a baby is a blessing, but it is also cruel to bring them into your world when you dont have something to give. Once a child is born, your entire plan for the future revolves around them. One of the cruelest things, many parents who have accidents fail to realize is that the struggle to survive is real an extra mouth to feed medical bills after birth, clothes, diapers, bottles, daycare, annual check ups and so much more at the end of the day. Please be her rock. She needs you more than ever, just as much as you need her, it will hurt. But this hurt will pass maybe not entirely, but it will pass

Hormones. Man let her process. It takes how long it takes, miscarried and had to have surgery and wanted the baby. The hormones they do what they want therapy, support groups and yoga and educating. I knew nothing and am still learning. Its a loss, regardless of how it is a loss and it is a trauma to the body.

Regardless if you are pro life or pro choice, abortions can be very taxing mentally, emotionally and physically. You both agreed on the decision, so the best thing to do is just be as supportive as possible.

You are doing amazing at supporting her and although you may not be able to tell you are comforting her a great deal continue being patient and supportive and without seemingly like you are trying to fix the problem you should def suggest therapy to her or better yet help her research places that both of you can go to for support planned parenthood is a great place to start if it is any consolation at all. This stranger on the internet me hello confusion does not think that either of you killed your baby she is not a murderer neither of you snuck into someone is house and stole a healthy baby out of its crib and killed it you are both doing the best you can with what you have and you are far from the only people in history to make this decision for the reasons you did, wishing you both the best and hoping that you get the support you both need waving hand

My boyfriend and I have been together for years. Our relationship is great, and we have experienced a lot of great times together.

I do stay over a lot at his house, but like to keep my apartment as my own personal space eventhough, we are both pretty busy. We always manage to make time for eachother.

I guess she works days a week for him and does everything she cooks, makes meal preps for the days she does not work cleans, does his laundry and his grocery shopping picks up packages for him. She is still a friend, so my boyfriend is still pretty informal with her. Since he works from home, they pretty much spend a lot of time together. The days she works and cooks, she joins him orUs, depending if I am able to come over that dayconfusion for dinner. He also lets her drive his car to run errands. I know she is working for him, and she is getting paid, but it still feels weird that she is doing all these personal things for him cooking, doing his laundry and other things to take care of him, almost being a wife. I feel like those are things I want to do for him. I want to take care of him like this, and I feel weird that another woman is doing. It has been nicer for our relationship since his house is now nicer, and he can spend all the time he does have with me. My friendship with her is still great, and nothing has changed.

But somehow, now I feel weird. I have not really talked with my boyfriend about this, because I do not want to come over as insecure and controlling. How can I deal with this situation in a mature and rational way without letting my emotions get the best of me?

Shes washing his underwear. She does not want to be with him. Yes, it may seem intimate and personal, but no woman who washes guys clothes will want to be with them as clean as guys are. Their boxers briefs are disgusting. You should be thanking her. Lol, you feelings are definitely relevant. Just tell him how you feel.

Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this.

Sad to say, though this is normal, it may seem like a relief for both of you, but the responsibility of that event does weighs a lot.

She will also be under a lot of hormonal changes and imbalances in the next few weeks, even up to a month.

Even when you know it is the right thing to do. There is still a grieving process. It will take time and love and support, but it sounds like you two are pretty solid in your relationship, so you will get through this together. There are always counselling services that you can go to for advice if you think you need more guidance. But it sounds like you are doing all the right things. Just give her your time and love.

Pro choice here, my former partner and I had an abortion in january of we do not regret it. We were together for nearly years, and we were in exactly your situation. We could not afford children. It would limit us in pursuit of our education and make climbing any type of economic ladder that much harder we wanted kids. We talked it through and even though we had supportive families who offered the moon in the instance, if we had kept the fetus, we worried more about our family as a whole. Would our second kid have a better chance since we would be worse of financially? Would they have a better or worse life? What would they grow up to be given that we would be working constantly and would not be able to spend time with them? The right choice was to hold off on kids now to provide the best possible life for any future kids so we can also live to our potential as humans? As a couple, I still have thoughts of, oh, they would be going to preschool. They would have been born this month, but I do not regret it at all. I am the slightest. I do wonder what it. The pills in my situation caused bleeding for two or three months, spotting constantly. It was not a whole lot. It stopped. It was just an unpleasant reminder that kept us from moving on for longer than necessary. She needs to get into therapy. You two needTo get into therapy together and go through these emotions, process them. Its okay to grieve, even if it is the right choice.

So sorry. This happened honestly, probably do not listen me. I am only and am partially high in. When I was depressed, I listened to music, calm, soothing, music. And sometimes its best to think about all the good things in your life. Instead of focusing on the bad

Apply for either couples therapy or a joint therapy session. There no other way going about it that honestly, the only and best choice you can make right now support her no matter what, and try and comfort her as much as possible.

I was the same way after my abortion, and honestly, only time made it better. Ive struggled a lot mentally in my life, but it was the most alone I had ever felt. It is been almost four years, and I still feel a pang in my heart when I think about it. She is grieving and just needs support. Keep doing what you are doing and check in with her. A support group would have helped me a lot. So I would look into that for sure.

Mate. I am really sorry. You are going through this my wife of years now and I had an abortion at age, and we have never regretted it every few years, I check in with her to see how she feels about it, and every time she says zero regrets. So I cannot imagine what you are going through my point. Thats it is different for different couples. But all I can say from experience is that you have made the right choice at a pivotal time of life, sending all the positive vibes I can mate.

This is normal. No woman has an abortion and does not feel awful. Try and get her some counselling. It was only a tiny ball of cells, and you made the right decision. That does not mean it was not hard support her as much as you can, but do not ignore your own mental health either. She will feel like this for a while. A trip away would be good. Some new stuff to fill both your brains be kind to each other.

Yes, I had an abortion and regretted it so much. The father wanted the abortion and made it clear he will not take part in my baby life. He knew my father had abandoned me, and I suffered for years because of it, and feared the same happening to my child. I was depressed for months. Whenever I saw kids, I would cry and get emotional, I prayed and fasted. It was hell, and it was kiling me. I became mentally ill and cut myself. I did therapy, but it did not seem to help much. I eventually got over it and hated my ex for abandoning me and forcing me to do that, because I did not want to raise the baby alone in the ghetto that I lived just the way I grew up. I had a tough childhood and wanted to give my child a better life. I would tell myself it would have been ok, just me and baby, I hated myself too. Eventually I got over it and realised I did what was best and asked god to forgive me. Sometimes I would get emotional. When I talk to my kid through prayer, I always stop myself from talking further before I lose my mind again. Whenever I see a baby with big, dark eyes, I always think maybe my child would have looked like her. Him. This never goes for me. For me. It gets better, and you get strong and learn to live with it.

Anyone that has a miscarriage grieves and blames themselves for it though they know deep down its not their fault but someone that has an abortion blames themselves and cannot tell themselves its not their fault she made the choice yes but that does not mean shes happy about it she grieving a life that could have been its definitely not something that shes going to get over in the matter of days she might not ever fully get over it I had a miscarriage in my hormones werent high enough to get a positive pregnancy test but already being a mom I knew the signs that I was pregnant so no one believed I was actually having a miscarriage except the father whom cried with me we both still grieve you should be there for her as best as you can and do not repeat.

A pregnancy loss is a pregnancy loss, chosen or not. The what ifs haunt you for life? Esp if you want kids in the future, im pro choice and have not had a abortion, but I have had a miscarriage at weeks and a stillborn at weeks, the end result of emotions was the same. In the end, I am still grieving for both children equally if I had chosen to abort early on, because hubby and I were not ready. I imagine I still would feel the same grief. Pregnancy hormones do not fuck around. It can take anywhere from weeks to months to be able to get back to normal, depending on the person support her and grieve with her. Honestly, it all you can do. Your choice was not wrong, even if it feels that way. After everything is all said and done, everything happens for a reason. Aborted miscarriage, if it was not meant to be, it was not meant to be whatever made you two come to the same conclusion of abortion. It could of saved you suffering a miscarriage or a stillborn had you not made that choice, too? And you would end up not having the child anyway or the baby could have been born and died shortly after. Both are way more common than you might think. It just a topic not talked about enough publicly. Heck, maybe the baby itself said, fuck! Nows not a good time. Mom, dad, stop this now you re not ready andMy body will not be right and compelled you two to terminate. Who knows, really something to think about that might bring her comfort if you both can overcome this together for all you know, that baby spirit can come back to you two I know that is what I like to believe happened with my losses. Each of my miscarriages followed with a successful one. None of us know how the entire life death thing really works.

I felt like this it was with me a long time until I got some counseling. It was surprising to me because I have always been pro choice, etc. But it did plunge me into guilt and depression edit to adsadness. The guilt was due to feeling I had no other choice and that I let myself be coerced.

Please put on alarms or some things that remember you to take care of her or dont miss you in your own sadness or anger. I can tell you that even if you dont feel, the things can get fixed or you think you can live without her. I have passed this and can tell you I dont want to live anymore. Cuz she left me I cant sleep or think, and I cant fix it or have a normal life. Please listen to me and watch yourself of hurting her.

As a woman who is strongly pro choice, pro choice does not always mean pro abortion. I personally could never have one, regardless of the position in life. However, the feelings she is experiencing are most likely due to the hormones that are being produced from the pregnancy, even thought it is being ended. I strongly urge you both to go to therapy, whether it be together or separate sessions to talk through the emotions you both are feeling also keep an eye out for post parfum depression, which is more common than you would think.

Been in ur position also in college. It sucks, but it gets easier for her, be there for her but try not to be too overbearing. And hopefully in a few months, she will only be thinking about it a couple of times a day. It gets better.

Her body is still raging with hormones. She going to be more moody and irritable than usual. She could be fine one minute and in tears. The next be there for her support her. Show her love and affection and everything will be okay. It natural to have abit of regret and wonder about the could be and the what ifs after doing something like this?

With respect. She is upset because she knows exactly what she did. And so do you it easy to repeat the convenient and soothing lies. We are all fed and brush the kid off as a clump of cells until it is your kid and they are gone. Then reality sets in the new life. You two made your growing child is dead and now you have two choices. You can sink into denial, pretend that you feel bad for no reason, and probably go on to do it again, or you can acknowledge what happened. Learn from it and develop as a person. The former is tempting and easy. The latter is one of the hardest things anyone can ever do your call man, whatever you choose. I wish you both well,

This is why I just could not be pro choice anymore. My mom told me a year or so ago that she had aborted her first I her only child, but knew she had two miscarriages before meconfusion. She was so depressed, it affected her physically like pain, and she could not leave her room for weeks because of the abortion she had trouble conceiving after, and her second was a miscarriage. She was lucky enough to have me. But the doctors told her she absolutely could not have any more kids because it would be another high risk pregnancy. As I wasconfusion, I am not sure of the details, but I know she had complications. I am not religious or anything, but from listening to my mom and others describe what actually happens during the process of the abortion, a cluster of cells or not some things just are not right, and I believe we all subconsciously know this, especially given the after effects of it mentally and physicallyconfusion. I really do not say this to shame you. I just do not think many people realize the effects it can have on people potentially for the rest of their lives. I have never heard a lot about the risks of infertility or how it affect you afterwards until I started talking more with my mom, and she finally told me, I hope you two continue to heal and are able to get therapy, talking with others, especially if they have been through the same situation.Can really help you get through this.

The what if game is a slippery slope? Statistically, you were times more likely to birth a serial killer than a president. So just be cognizant of the fact that when you are doing that, you generally only apply the most optimistic of attributes and accomplishments. In reality, though the child will be much more likely to achieve that positive result of birth, parents are educated and financially stable, the homelife and zip code will likely be better and your future kids will be more likely to have parents that are present instead of trying to hustle the next rent payment that the pragmatic answer the other side of that coin, is that her hormones are probably going ape shit right now on top of the mental stress and young age, it is going to be a little turbulent for a bit. Same thing if she were to carry to term that first few months can be an emotional roller coaster, calm and steady wins this race man, and figure out a more suitable birth control method. Once is an ops. More than once is a pattern

Its like she is actually grieving a family member. Well, yeah, because she is the two of you just snuffed out a human life, your own child, life at that, whatever hardships you would have had to overcome to make things work, I am sure that child would have preferred that to being murdered before it ever even had a chance to live, to grow up, to experience joy and sorrow, to fall in love, all gone. Now, this is such a sick part of our society. Not only that we do this to our children, but that we teach people it is okay to do so or even the right thing to do if it inconveniences us too much if you cannot afford to have a kid in your life at the time, use some contraception or keep it in your damn pants. Using abortion as a mulligan is just monstrous. Get yourself some therapy, not much else to say.

Title: My confusion, boyfriend confusion hired his childhood friend confusion as his maid personal assistant.
Thread
My boyfriend and I have been together for years. Our relationship is great, and we have experienced a lot of great times together. We both are very career driven and live separately because it is more convenient because of work. I do stay over a lot at his house, but like to keep my apartment as my own personal space eventhough, we are both pretty busy. We always manage to make time for eachother. My boyfriend works at a law firm and started his own business last year. So he does not really have much free time since the start of the pandemic. He has been working from home, and he usually likes to spend the free time he does have hanging out with me or going to the gym. This pretty much leaves him very little time to do any house work or cook, so he pretty much orders food daily from a couple of local places and cleans his house. Once a week, he has talked to me about hiring a personal assistant who pretty much does everything he does not have time to do. They would basically cook clean, do his laundry, go grocery shopping and run errands for him. This way he would be able to live healthier and better, since he would not be eating take out every night, and his house would be clean and presentable. He has a childhood friend who I have pretty much known since the start of our relationship. They are pretty close friends since theyHave known eachother for over years. She is great and we like to hang out all together. She has helped him through some struggles he had when he was younger, so they trust eachother a lot. The friend has recently been going through a rough time. She broke up with her longterm boyfriend, who she lived with and also lost her job. She lives in her own apartment now, but is having a hard time financially to help her out. My boyfriend asked her if she wanted to work for him as his assistant maid, untill, she found a stable job. I had no problem with this because she also was there for him when he was struggling, and I want her to be in a better position. She accepted the offer. She has been working for my boyfriend for about a month. He pays her good, she does her job well, and objectively, the situation has been great. But somehow, over the past month, I have started feeling weird about this whole arrangement, and kind of built up some jealousy. I guess she works days a week for him and does everything she cooks, makes meal preps for the days she does not work cleans, does his laundry and his grocery shopping picks up packages for him. She is still a friend, so my boyfriend is still pretty informal with her. Since he works from home, they pretty much spend a lot of time together. The days she works and cooks, she joins him orUs, depending if I am able to come over that dayconfusion for dinner. He also lets her drive his car to run errands. I know she is working for him, and she is getting paid, but it still feels weird that she is doing all these personal things for him cooking, doing his laundry and other things to take care of him, almost being a wife. I feel like those are things I want to do for him. I want to take care of him like this, and I feel weird that another woman is doing. It has been nicer for our relationship since his house is now nicer, and he can spend all the time he does have with me. My friendship with her is still great, and nothing has changed. I just have this weird territorial feeling over my boyfriend, my boyfriend and I are both very mature, and we trust eachother, and normally I would think that something like this would not bother me. But somehow, now I feel weird. I have not really talked with my boyfriend about this, because I do not want to come over as insecure and controlling. How can I deal with this situation in a mature and rational way without letting my emotions get the best of me?

Omgosh. Yes, depression is normal. The fact the you are questioning and wanting advice I do give you points for that. I am confused about the turning to reddit for answers, but to each their own, she should see a therapist, and you need to be there for her, even if she goes off the wall, this is not going to be an easy road. Okay, the fact you thought everything would go back to normal in a couple of days is highly alarming. That tells me your relationship, most likely, will not last. This is your moment as a man push through and fight for her

Grief has no time limit at all give her as much time and support as she needs if she thinks that getting some grief counselling will help look into it. I tried emir, and that worked for me.

This is not uncommon. Being pro choice is one thing actually making that choice is something altogether different. You do need to keep an eye on her. This does not always go well until after they affect us, and then things often go poorly.

I am sorry I have been in the exact same place as your girlfriend. Give her time to grieve and maybe suggest she talk to a counsellor, be patient and take breaks for your mental health. Sometimes the right decision is still painful. Once she feels better physically, that should help a bit that makes you extra vulnerable.

I went through the exact same thing, but from the female side, I am a college student currently and had ended up pregnant in at only years old. So decided that an abortion using a pill method like your girlfriend, didconfusion, was the best option, despite previously believing I would never in my life do something like that. I struggled with depression, suicidal thoughts for a long time and still have issues talking about it in depth. As I do think of what my child would be like today, I would mainly recommend just making sure she is aware you are there for her and supporting her as she goes through this, which it seems you are doing already. So props to you. I believe it just takes time. There is also support groups where you can talk with others going through the same thing virtually or in person, which I would recommend, as it personally, helped me to talk to others who could relate. Also, look into therapy for yourself as well. I wish you and your girlfriend the best and good luck.

I had a medical abortion a week ago and have been experiencing the same thing as your partner. My hormones were out of control, and I was only weeks along. I had the same guilt as I am in a loving relationship with a man that I want to marry and have kids with someday. So I was heartbroken thinking, maybe I had made a mistake. Its been a week, and my hormones have gotten back to normal. Though I am still depressed, I am feeling more level headed and can see more clearly that it was the right choice for both of us. Just be supportive and shower her in love. My partner wrapped me up in a coon in our bed, bought me lots of snacks, a pair of pa pants and some fuzzy socks. It helped a lot, and it made me feel really loved.

Ye that is a normal response. Abortions are generally traumatic. Do consider that this will take a toll on your relationship. Do not be surprised too if things get blue valentines after this.

Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

I was forced into an abortion years ago and that still haunts me even more so now that my fiance and I are struggling to conceive and have been told my partner is near enough sterile I grieve that child everyday but it has gotten easier when I start to feel like a terrible person I remind myself that I was not in a position to care for a child at that point in my life the guy who got me pregnant back then was an abusive pos and that would have been a healthy environment for a child I was in a job I hated that had the constant threat of redundancy so it was definitely for the best that I got bullied in to that abortion

Hey, op you already got a lot of great advice. The only thing here that stood out to me is your comment about that you thought she do be over it within a day and maybe there are some people that get over it that fast. But I had an abortion over a year ago and still have days that I feel like an absolute shit. Even though I fully stand behind my choice, she might not be like me and get over it earlier or take longer, but things like these normally take a long time.

This is normal it will get better but have no illusions that she will ever completely get over it or forget it. Mothers never forget such things. It will always remain a shadow of the past, even though it would pale over time, the coping is best under the watchful attention of a trained professional. She needs therapy.

I had an abortion almost two years ago, and there is not a day that goes by that. I do not think about my bean. I am pro choice, and im so thankful I had the right to actually make the choice. But it does not mean it was ever an easy one. I knew it was the right decision. And I can confirm that the first year month pregnancy and then leading up to possible due date is extremely difficult there where days I could not get out of bed and you are right to say it is like a grieving family member, but it does get easier, and you just have to be there for her riding the waves of her emotions. I did not have my partner with me through the stages of my abortion or grieving. But I did have a fantastic support system around me, and it really made a difference in this time. Please just let her feel however she wants to feel and support her like you areconfusion, lots of physical and mental support. It was also incredibly hard mentally for me to have sex after the abortion. So please give plenty of time for this as well. Youl both get through this with time and patience. Best of luck,

I think people have been very helpful in their responses, but I just one to add that you need to always remember that the right choice is not always the easy one. More often, it is not, in fact, doing what is right for you and her does not mean it will not come with a price.

Yep I felt this way even though I was getting myself out of a bad situation with a guy that was like a sociopath and mentally insane it was hard on me very painful but I literally started bawling my eyes out when I woke up after the procedure and was a melted down mess for two weeks after hormones are stripped from your body suddenly that were created during pregnancy which also leads to hormone issues but it is sad and you do grieve happens during a miscarriage too which I have experienced that too bring her home some flowers and run her a hot bath and just be as loving as you can let her know that you guys will try again in the future when you are ready and maybe get some sort of pill protection or use condoms until you are ready because it is harder every time you go through it, I feel for you guys

I have always been pro choice but never expected that I would be in that position myself. I just had a baby back in august. She was my second, my fiance, and I were doing what we could for birth control. I was on the pill. Well, early january, I took a test and found out our worst nightmare, pregnant. I immediately knew that I could not go through with the pregnancy. I am still trying to finish college as well as I went back when I was now turning in aprilconfusion. I called planned parenthood and started preparing myself mentally. A couple of weeks before my procedure, I opted for the surgical abortionconfusion. I started spiraling. I started questioning my decision. I felt a whirlwind of emotions, but then I reminded myself, it is my body, it is my choice, nobody elses and I am valid. My reasons are valid and I can get through this. I should add as well that I had two sections recovery after second section is about months. I was in a lot of pain as my uterus began trying to expand for this fetus. I am a plus sized woman and also high risk for gestation, diabetes. I had it both pregnancies and likely would have had it this one. Both babies were born with sugar issues. Second, one needed a week of hospitalization after birth. My ob said my chances of dying during this section delivery were higher and dangerous. Chance of uterine rupture was high chance ofPreterm labor and extremely low birth weight due to growth restriction was high. I had to remind myself that I have two beautiful babies that need me. I chose them. I chose myself. It was just a fetus. At that point, I did not murder anything I made a choice to exterminate a clump of cells that I did not want in my body. It was not wanted, and I did not want to risk losing my life and leaving my babies behind the day of the procedure, everything actually went extremely smooth. My fiance was there to support me. My babies were at daycare, and I was in and out within hours, no excessive bleeding. And walking out of there felt great. I opted for the nexplanon arm implantconfusion, and they did it right after my procedure. I walked out with confidence. I put a middle finger up to the protestors that came up to my car, calling me a baby killer. As we drove out and forced myself to move on, I made a choice. It was over. I did not want to spend my days grieving. What could have been? I did pay respects mentally to this pregnancy that I ended and knew that I needed to soldier up and move forward. So I did not end up spiraling. It sounds like she is really struggling and regrets her decision. I would recommend getting her to talk to somebody a professional she can and will get through this. But it was a bigDecision she made and trauma happened to her body. Try to be there for her. Dont say too much, offer support to her as best as you can and for the love of everything I know get her some help heart suit.

I think it is deeply naive to expect things to go back to normal in a day or two. It sounds like she would benefit from talk therapy. Hopefully her insurance covers it.

I was not ready for my first pregnancy and had an abortion. But not being ready does not make the loss hurt any less. I too severely underestimated the emotions involved in deciding, and so did my family. To my detriment. I spent the next few years in a deep grief spiral and could not fix it. Please get her and you both some professional help. It is necessary. Today, I am on baby and I had one other abortion a couple of years ago. That was an entirely different experience, because I had just had a child and truly was in a different place than the first time, but still just as unprepared to go to term, I still suffer from the trauma of the first time, but the second time was very relieving. Its less about the abortion and more about the circumstances under which you have to make a life changing decision. I truly hope for the best for you guys.

I am pro life, but I do not judge anyone going through it after they have an abortion, be there for her and comfort her. Thats what she needs most right now.

So the abortion pills are not all that easy to process they change your body because you are trying to end something and expulse it out afterwards. I believe that is how the pills work confusion these pills are mostly hormonal, and hormones are not really all that kind to anyone. It will be a couple of weeks until she stops hurting the emotional aspect of it. No one will ever listen to someone say, im so happy and exited to have an abortion cant wait for this friday. Want to join. Abortions are hard. They hit everyone hard. You can be pro choice or pro life and they still hit you hard. You understood that you could not have a baby right now. Imagine if you dod had it, you could have been an unfit parent, traumatized a child with different struggles that should not have existed in the first place grew resentful of a child because they were not meant to be here right now. So many factors that must have contributed to you guys taking the decision of having an abortion. Im pro choice, but I am not pro abortion. I cannot go to another persons life and tell them what to do. That is just messed up. And it is not even my business to begin with. And at the same time, people cannot tell me what to do. If I were in that situation, what you guys did must have hit you so hard. It is also a loss for youToo. It would be a different story if the abortion was forced on her. But from what I read, it is a mutual decision. Both of you need couples counseling, because this is not an easy event to process. I hope for the best, and I hope things get better for both of you.

It is normal to grieve an abortion. She needs some time and space and someone to listen she can visit, or if she needs anonymous support. Invite her to be gentle with herself. No one gets pregnant on purpose to have an abortion. And as she moves forward, remind her that you both did the best you could with what information you had. And abortion is often a thoughtfully made and loving choice. As her hormones change, she may feel better, but it can also take some time. It is normal to feel a wide range of emotions, but most people ultimately feel a lot of relief.

Theres no one right way to feel after an event like this. And I think your instincts here are wonderful. My advice is to embrace the grief and vulnerability that are to come in the following weeks with your girlfriend, of course, if she needs her space and alone time to process, too. That is perfectly fine and encouraged. But my point here is try not to work through this alone as painful and messy as it can be to work through this aftermath as a team. It is also a time to come together and lean on one another and even grow closer. A lot of people simply need someone to be there following this, and ideally it should be your partner who you are going through this with. These are the times where you really learn. If your relationship can stand the choppy waters and there is nothing more emotionally isolating than feeling like you have to work all these ensuing emotions out by yourself. A lot of people here have already given great advice, but mine is to simply check in on her regularly. Hey, how you feeling? Can I get you anything? I just want to let you know that I am here for you and I care about you and I want to help you, etc. These are small things, but in my opinion, they are the most meaningful. Just be present attentive, gentle and caring. I truly wish you both all the best moving forward. Purple heart

I had a very close friend who got severely depressed after an abortion she eventually got on anti depressants which really helped her. I also had one at when I got pregnant I was obviously scared and far too young, but he was mentally and physically abusive. This maybe will not help much in the moment but now she and I both have children that we were prepared for and are amazing and would not be here otherwise I would not change a thing personally.

I had an abortion without telling anyone at all. And driving myself I did cry during the actual procedure, but it was because they did not inject my iv correctly. So whatever was supposed to help with the pain did not actually go through or whatever. I stayed like an extra min because I turned pale. Vitals were super low, and I was shivering. Once my vitals got back up, I drove myself home. I never really thought about it in a negative way. It just depends on your outlook. I suppose I do not want kids in the future, so I think I sensed relief. She obviously wants kids in the future, and moreover, she wants them with you. So she is feeling a genuine loss, not to mention the hormonal changes that occur after an abortion. Those did make me very emotional tbhconfusion. I would suggest her or both of you taking to a therapist if you feel the pain or loss might impact you all a lot

Title: Girlfriend is depressed after an abortion.
Thread
Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this.

Me and my girlfriend are also broke college students, and I cannot even imagine what we would do if we were put in your position. I cannot imagine what you are going through. Your girlfriend is brave. She is not a bad person for doing what is best for her. Make sure you tell her that. But try to have tact, be there for her. Give her space when she needs it. And more than anything, just love her like there is no tomorrow.

Pregnancy is a roller coaster and terminating pregnancy is like a rollercoaster that broke in the middle her body, her emotions, her hormones, they are everywhere right now allow her time to have her feelings be there and cry and talk and mourn with her. Be careful with her. Depression is very normal at this stage, and probably for several weeks and into a few months, she should grieve. Maybe get some books or watch some videos that align with her death culture to help ease her heart. I personally find a lot of comfort in reincarnation myth. It feels a lot more forgiving. But either way, please be kind you yourselves and each other. Nobody can tell you how to grieve

Still going through it. Now I had one in october. Some days are better than others. Just continue to be there for her. Remind her it was the best decision at the moment. I am not sure of your beliefs or religion, but repent. Try to do better in the future.

Title: My confusion, boyfriend confusion hired his childhood friend confusion as his maid personal assistant.
Thread
My boyfriend and I have been together for years. Our relationship is great, and we have experienced a lot of great times together. We both are very career driven and live separately because it is more convenient because of work. I do stay over a lot at his house, but like to keep my apartment as my own personal space eventhough, we are both pretty busy. We always manage to make time for eachother. My boyfriend works at a law firm and started his own business last year. So he does not really have much free time since the start of the pandemic. He has been working from home, and he usually likes to spend the free time he does have hanging out with me or going to the gym. This pretty much leaves him very little time to do any house work or cook, so he pretty much orders food daily from a couple of local places and cleans his house. Once a week, he has talked to me about hiring a personal assistant who pretty much does everything he does not have time to do. They would basically cook clean, do his laundry, go grocery shopping and run errands for him. This way he would be able to live healthier and better, since he would not be eating take out every night, and his house would be clean and presentable. He has a childhood friend who I have pretty much known since the start of our relationship. They are pretty close friends since theyHave known eachother for over years. She is great and we like to hang out all together. She has helped him through some struggles he had when he was younger, so they trust eachother a lot. The friend has recently been going through a rough time. She broke up with her longterm boyfriend, who she lived with and also lost her job. She lives in her own apartment now, but is having a hard time financially to help her out. My boyfriend asked her if she wanted to work for him as his assistant maid, untill, she found a stable job. I had no problem with this because she also was there for him when he was struggling, and I want her to be in a better position. She accepted the offer. She has been working for my boyfriend for about a month. He pays her good, she does her job well, and objectively, the situation has been great. But somehow, over the past month, I have started feeling weird about this whole arrangement, and kind of built up some jealousy. I guess she works days a week for him and does everything she cooks, makes meal preps for the days she does not work cleans, does his laundry and his grocery shopping picks up packages for him. She is still a friend, so my boyfriend is still pretty informal with her. Since he works from home, they pretty much spend a lot of time together. The days she works and cooks, she joins him orUs, depending if I am able to come over that dayconfusion for dinner. He also lets her drive his car to run errands. I know she is working for him, and she is getting paid, but it still feels weird that she is doing all these personal things for him cooking, doing his laundry and other things to take care of him, almost being a wife. I feel like those are things I want to do for him. I want to take care of him like this, and I feel weird that another woman is doing. It has been nicer for our relationship since his house is now nicer, and he can spend all the time he does have with me. My friendship with her is still great, and nothing has changed. I just have this weird territorial feeling over my boyfriend, my boyfriend and I are both very mature, and we trust eachother, and normally I would think that something like this would not bother me. But somehow, now I feel weird. I have not really talked with my boyfriend about this, because I do not want to come over as insecure and controlling. How can I deal with this situation in a mature and rational way without letting my emotions get the best of me?

You are not being irrational at all. No one starts off with the intention of cheating also, if she is spending all that alone time together, strengthening their relationship. As you have said, doing all the wifey stuff for him could cause him to have feelings for her. I would nip it in the bud, approach him softly with kindness and put an end to it. I mean, romance novels are not based of fantasy alone. There is something to be said about the hot boss falling for his maid secretary and her underprivileged life becoming easier, etc.

Title: I confusion think my sister confusion is being controlled by her boyfriend confusion.
Thread
Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

Look, theres a reason so many people fall in love with their babysitters assistants, coworkers, you fall in love with the people you spend time with. Shes basically having dinner with him nights a week. Shes getting more face to face time than you are and shes improving his life. Why wouldnt he think, huh? I want to have kids and who would make a better choice? You who is not even ready to live with him and wants personal space or the person who makes him food every night and asks him how his day went? Its like an obvious choice. Ultimately, though, you focusing on moving in together and not on her, just on the natural next steps in your relationship are what you should do, not trying to get him to fire her yet be you probably wont win that argument.

Sounds like she is in an abusive hostage situation, and your family may need to consider working with professionals who can help with deprogramming her stockholm syndrome.

Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

Shes clearly in an abusive relationship. All of this he is doing is just the beginning of something much worse that can occur in the future. If you do not do something, I would definitely seek domestic violence help because she could get hurt even worse. And that would be terrifying to think of.

Caleb is definitely pretending to be your sister in those texts. Refusing to video call and only giving super short answers is incredibly suspicious.

I hope she is ok, which I believe she is. But caleb just shutdown all ways for her to contact the outside world. If she is resilient, as you, she will be fine. Many blessings and prayers.

Hoping for the best outcome. But right off the bat, that age difference is a huge giveaway. Yes, more likely than not being controlled. No modern day, sober minded male over typically wants to be in a relationship with a year old, and if he does, there is probably going to be some not so innocent intentions deep down inside, not saying it cannot ever work out. But most of these age gaps do not work out.

But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

I do not know much about physical abuse in relationships, but I know that after fights, boxers will go into hiding until their faces have healed enough. It could be she is injured and is ashamed of herself and thinks it is her fault until she is healed.

This breaks my heart. Men and women like caleb deserved to have their autonomy rights completely stripped so they know what it feels like to be a prisoner in a relationship. Unfortunately, in these situations, you cannot do much because she is a consenting adult who is being manipulated and frightened into doing whatever this man says. This is a very shitty situation, and most of your energy should be spent reminding yourself that you are doing all you can

This is really frightening. I am sorry you are going through this and seem like it is mostly on your own. I hope your sister turns up to be okay.

Sounds like they are suffering from ptsd from your brother dying. They re together because of the connection to your brother. And the best thing you can do is be there for her, but do not try to break them up. Try to get them try, go the therapy to help them heal mentally from your brothers death, you should probably go tooconfusion. I went through something similar when me and my of were dating, my brother was murdered. We did not have any relationship issues at first, and our relationship actually got stronger. The issues started when my parents felt like she was taking me away from them long story short. They caused a lot of problems for us, but we did not break up over it and made it harder to break up with her further down the line when we did start having relationship issues. We dated years, but it probably would have only been if my parents stayed out of it. Kind of hard to dump someone who put up with what she put up withconfusion. It also sucks when you break up and your family is happy about your sadness and is not supportive at all. Sounds like you would be a lot more supportive. There was not any abuse in my situation. So it is not really the same. But my point is you cannot make them break up and trying might make it worse. I am very introverted and do not like the thought of therapy, but think itWould have helped.

Its recently gotten worse because we are both beginning our careers after university. I like mine. She is unhappy with hers. I am now wondering if, just by living our common dream, I am doing more harm than good to her, I would never want to break up with her. You can tell how important we are to each other.

She probably would benefit from therapy its not very helpful advice to just say she just needs to get over it when it comes to a lifelong dream she needs a professional to help her cope with her feelings about it and gain to tools to help her cope with watching someone live her dream while she cannot she would also likely fare better if she were not openly unhappy with her new career path. Whatever it may be, most people have multiple things they enjoy some dont some people just really have one thing and that is itconfusion. So it seems strange to choose to go into a career you hate when you could likely find something you at least feel neutrally about, much less enjoy

The whole reason you made this your life goal was because the two of you wanted emulate her father. So maybe have him talk to her and get her to persue something. Fulfilling money will not really be a problem. I am guessing.

Wow, I feel her. I made it to med school and realized after years and debt that I was not good enough and have had to start my life over. Its tough. I could not imagine living with someone who is getting to live the dream, but honestly, she can make it just keep being attentive and supportive. I crumbled in my shell. The fact that she still tries is remarkable and inspiring. Just keep loving her.

Why is she failing? Is she unable to retain the information? Does she get really nervous during a test? And second guess her answers if she knows the material but keeps failing the test I wonder if she could have adhd it commonly underdiagnosed in females, it presents differentlyconfusion and the more intelligent a person is, the harder it is to diagnose since they learn how to mask the more obvious traits fairly early on.

But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

Bro, please. I beg you, this is very serious. That dude is a maniac. I know people like that who get furious about a single mistake, like a glitching app. Trust me, someone who screams on top of his lungs at his partner, for a glitch would even kill a person who hides a whole day from him. This is worst scenario, but you hear it on the news too often. Maybe its caleb who is answering the phone, and only god knows what happened to her. I dont want to panic you, but there are many scenarios in my head right now. Maybe the fight got even more serious. I can imagine that he threatened your sister on the phone, maybe that he would beat you if she dont go home right now, or stuff like that or kill someone who is important to her than at home. Things could have escalated even more, and you can imagine the rest. I cannot judge that guy. Maybe he is just an narcisstic idiot who would not get violent that easily. Did she ever got beaten or stuff like that bruises on her arms, etc. Confusion. But it scares me that they are both not at home and that she is not answering anything, maybe make her say something that only you both could now from the past in a funny way, or even fake it? Like I just remembered that we did. Xy. Do you remember? But you actually lie about the story? If she answersYea I remember or is like that then you know that its him and not your sis. And this could mean code red.

So basically you have not talked to your sister to where you could actually hear her voiceconfusion since before she came to stay with you, I would get the police involved. I hope everything turns out okay.

My sister does the same when she is with her fiance and they have a similar type of relationship to your sister, and I really believe she is in a extremely toxic relationship. Through we tried to tell her multiple times she just does not care.

Title: Girlfriend is depressed after an abortion.
Thread
Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

I mean, she basically killing a baby. Just being real woman, shrugging. Medium skin tone.

First your sister is an adult and their legally is not crap you can do about it other than asking the police to do a welfare check and they will get tired of that fast we are heating what happened in the red party and there is likely more to it than you know that does not mean he is abusive though he may very well be having said that the best advice is talk to her really talk to her ask her where she sees this going. Ask her what happens when she is? And he is the and I had seen this before in my case, an ex amd friend hooked up with a guy years her senior it fizzled out in a few years. We cannot control what another adult does. Sadly, even if they are making poor choices, we need to understand we do not have control

Is no one at the least suspicious of the fact. Almost all of these replies are a bit too convenient, and the police are just that bad at their jobs, massive red flags, but they do not issue a warrant to search the place. Room mate only audibly heard someone going through the room collecting things dad does not care no family to talk to. And an older of whose family is unreachable, he is not on social media, not a red flag, really, but it is a stereotype for people who have something to hide won file a missing person because the room mate says she is usually like this. But the history of abuse and manipulation is still present. And the sudden change in the communication, really, this is like an officers wet dream to catch a kidnapping victims, victimizer and save someone life. You can get a warrant very easy if there is probable cause, which there is seeing as they cannot locate either of the party members in the victim and suspect list. I am not saying this is true, not saying it is false. What I am saying is, I am over here, passed off at the thought a stranger is in danger, and the sister cannot even fucking usher, anger or frustration, no swearing, no assumptions, theories or actions that tell me this is a real matter. If it was my sister or my friend or even a fucking co worker that I am mildly friendly with, my ass isOut of my seat and not asking reddit for help post on the missing persons sleuth forums telling me they cant catch a license plate on camera a debit card a phone call made its not hard to pull phone records I know how fast this shit works because an ex of mine whose brother went missing in a red world country on vacation had a lead within, like, hours he was murdered and robbed at a stop light in south america with his of american police have way more tools to locate if thus is real. You hide tour fucking emotions really well. Even through text I am very good at understanding text and connecting it with emotion you only sound mildly concerned wouldn even call your drunk father a piece of shit for dismissing your missing, probably dead or kidnapped sister that what is suspicious? Who replies to their brother dying as it? Whatever? Like, it is not fucking weird to say in context with an older guy, possibly grooming a young girl whose, like, what years you get at the age of a high schooler who fucking says whatever to that? Either you are trolling looking for karma or a really bad liar

And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

Title: I confusion think my sister confusion is being controlled by her boyfriend confusion.
Thread
Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion.

So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

This is extremely fishy. The year age gap, considering your sister is just starting out in life, is especially concerning.

Title: How can I help my of confusion cope with the fact that I am confusion living her dream and she is not
Thread
Its a long story. Il try my best to sum it up. I confusion lost my dad when I was a little kid growing up. I spent a lot of time at my best friends house. That friend has become my girlfriend when we were in high school, and we are still together almost years later. Her dad is a surgeon and a very charismatic person, and naturally, we both wanted to be like him when we grew up. Here comes the rough part. I am currently training as a surgeon in her dad field. My of never passed the medical admission test and has gotten more and more stuck in another field in the last years since I began med school, and she didnt. She has not moved on a single bit. Its recently gotten worse because we are both beginning our careers after university. I like mine. She is unhappy with hers. I am now wondering if, just by living our common dream, I am doing more harm than good to her, I would never want to break up with her. You can tell how important we are to each other. From our story, our relationship is more important than any job for both of us. I just want this poor girl to find peace. I would do anything to pull her out of this hole. She is stuck in. What should could I do? I see no easy answers. Is I want to clarify that she is in no way guilting me orMaking me feel bad about my job. She is as supportive as she could be but it is also very clear that it is eating her from the inside to do both wanted to become my I am she is not she is unable to cope with it and move on. I do not know what to do to help her when I am part of the problem.

I am a first year med student and a lot of the people in my class are in their mid to late twenties. Its normal to have had work, career experience before med school. At this point, I think only of med students are straight out of college. At this point, she can still pursue medicine. In fact, having a partner in medicine, and the ensuing connections is a huge advantage, as you must know. Hook her up with shadowing volunteering research at your hospital. As much as you can show her how to use andi for the cat proofread her apps before she submits, have her apply to your previous med school or schools in your area by stating she has ties to the area. The list goes on and on youve played the game and won now show her the tips and tricks

Title: My confusion, boyfriend confusion hired his childhood friend confusion as his maid personal assistant.
Thread
My boyfriend and I have been together for years. Our relationship is great, and we have experienced a lot of great times together. We both are very career driven and live separately because it is more convenient because of work. I do stay over a lot at his house, but like to keep my apartment as my own personal space eventhough, we are both pretty busy. We always manage to make time for eachother. My boyfriend works at a law firm and started his own business last year. So he does not really have much free time since the start of the pandemic. He has been working from home, and he usually likes to spend the free time he does have hanging out with me or going to the gym. This pretty much leaves him very little time to do any house work or cook, so he pretty much orders food daily from a couple of local places and cleans his house. Once a week, he has talked to me about hiring a personal assistant who pretty much does everything he does not have time to do. They would basically cook clean, do his laundry, go grocery shopping and run errands for him. This way he would be able to live healthier and better, since he would not be eating take out every night, and his house would be clean and presentable. He has a childhood friend who I have pretty much known since the start of our relationship. They are pretty close friends since theyHave known eachother for over years. She is great and we like to hang out all together. She has helped him through some struggles he had when he was younger, so they trust eachother a lot. The friend has recently been going through a rough time. She broke up with her longterm boyfriend, who she lived with and also lost her job. She lives in her own apartment now, but is having a hard time financially to help her out. My boyfriend asked her if she wanted to work for him as his assistant maid, untill, she found a stable job. I had no problem with this because she also was there for him when he was struggling, and I want her to be in a better position. She accepted the offer. She has been working for my boyfriend for about a month. He pays her good, she does her job well, and objectively, the situation has been great. But somehow, over the past month, I have started feeling weird about this whole arrangement, and kind of built up some jealousy. I guess she works days a week for him and does everything she cooks, makes meal preps for the days she does not work cleans, does his laundry and his grocery shopping picks up packages for him. She is still a friend, so my boyfriend is still pretty informal with her. Since he works from home, they pretty much spend a lot of time together. The days she works and cooks, she joins him orUs, depending if I am able to come over that dayconfusion for dinner. He also lets her drive his car to run errands. I know she is working for him, and she is getting paid, but it still feels weird that she is doing all these personal things for him cooking, doing his laundry and other things to take care of him, almost being a wife. I feel like those are things I want to do for him. I want to take care of him like this, and I feel weird that another woman is doing. It has been nicer for our relationship since his house is now nicer, and he can spend all the time he does have with me. My friendship with her is still great, and nothing has changed. I just have this weird territorial feeling over my boyfriend, my boyfriend and I are both very mature, and we trust eachother, and normally I would think that something like this would not bother me. But somehow, now I feel weird. I have not really talked with my boyfriend about this, because I do not want to come over as insecure and controlling. How can I deal with this situation in a mature and rational way without letting my emotions get the best of me?

I do not think that you are being irrational my ex was helping his childhood friend out in a very similar fashion and I soon noticed a very emotional affair between them and they told me that I was wrong I decided to break it off. They have been a couple since almost the day that I ended it but that does not mean that is your situation just pay attention.

She could maybe do with removing herself from the scenario. I always encourage a month to months of travelling. Its long enough to remove you from your current surroundings. You stop thinking about the mundanity of work life, and more about the bigger picture. Travelling gives you lots of moments for introspection. Obviously, this might not be doable with you current work commitments, but a month travelling often helps.

This is her own internal battle she has to find a new passion and whatever she is in school for right now that is not it she should not continue something she is miserable with. The only thing you can do is support her maybe you can help her find her new passion if money is not a problem, maybe she needs time away from school work to explore new hobbies to find herself maybe in the future you can both sit together at a laptop and explore different career paths for her together there something in the world for everyone. If a path just does not work, no matter what we do, then there must be a better path ahead. She just needs to explore herself and find that better path it will take time to get over her initial dream. She will probably need to cry a lot to get her emotions out. Just be there for her embrace her. You do not need to say anything. Just be there as a shoulder to cry on, then you can both move on together and you can help her find her new passion

The cause of her failures is beyond your ability and oursconfusion to identify and to remove. Therefore, you are not a rescuer for her. And your attempts to play rescuer can only frustrate you both despite your honorable intentions. Despite your common sense ideas, no matter how desperately you want to help, you must stop trying to help. You are emotional support, not a therapist, not a career counselor. The sacrifice you must make is not to abandon medicine, but to abandon rescuing. Let take all this frustration to the trashcan. Stop helping start loving

It hard when you are trying to follow in someone else footsteps and sometimes people mistake that passion for what their loved one does as their own I am positive there is a field she would be happier in as for how you can help I would encourage her to try out therapy don be like I think you need this but maybe try it out yourself to make her comfortable with the idea and invite her to do it too could be shit advice ink

Is she aware of the book growth mindset as stuck as she is? She is certainly not ready to begin any kind of medical training. You cannot change her or anyone, really, but you can model possibilities and even show curiosity as a virtue through your own actions. I used to work in the or doc and I know a bit about the surgeon personality. He dad might have done a bit of a number on her personality in a different way than you experienced. If only due to the gender difference, I will point out your own self preoccupation by seeing yourself as part of her problem and you having some sort of responsibility to fix her. She is not a poor girl, she is a struggling perhaps woman who has to live her own life and make her own choices. My suggestion, truly is time apart. Dad pretty much overwhelmed you both, apparently, did she ever have any other choice, really? But to be like him, do she ever have an opportunity to figure out who she is, or was she a sort of social accessory? And you join the band, harsh, maybe but also, maybe true. She is unhappy in her career. It is her job to find what career she might be happy in? Not your job, not her father job. Has she had any freedom of choice at all? Does she have any freedom to explore now? Or are there expectations for her, aka social pressure and restraints as strong asAn in real life straitjacket if you never dated anyone else, are you trapping her or perhaps looking for a good reason to spread your wings, you are altruistically doing it for her wellbeing to repeat. You cannot fix her. She has to live her own life. Do not use her. And no temper, please I have survived, thrown scapples, horrors I cannot and will not describe here intentionally and knowingly created by well respected, highly charismatic medical professionals. You took the time to describe your situation, and I am giving you the benefit of the doubt. Assuming you are telling the truth and sharing my perspective and time, you will have human life in your hands day in and day out humility. Real humility is a virtue. So maybe you can start being honest with yourself, at least about this entire situation. Your statement that your story shows how important you are to each other, makes no sense. You took yourself into her family, found yourself a father figure, and have built yourself a life where in there does that entitle you to a relationship with the daughter you managed to create one. And if you do care for her really face these truths. Perhaps the time apart will give you both space to see what is real and what has been constructed around you. And maybe by you yourself. Honesty is not easy you will find daily. It is the only way I never told a patient, it will be all right, you willBe fine in any surgery. That is a lie. I saitongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. I will be with you. I will be here. I suggest you consider the same. One of the best surgeons I knew included the cleaning staff in the weekly unit meetings beginning to end because the unit had critical, long term patients. And he said the patients tell the cleaning staff more than they tell any nurse or doctor and they see them for longer times. And more often, the cleaning people know more about the families, the situations and the patients than any of us, and we need to know what they know to get the best results. Smart man, good man. He also happened to be a great surgeon, too, ultimately famous, too. The surgeon who told his harvard med school roommate that he wanted a specialty in which he could become famous. I learned this from the roommate, directly, in personconfusion did become famous harvard, being harvard, after all, and in many circles, widely reviled, I knew him well. He did few of his own surgeries. Never mind whose name was on the charts.

Buddy went through something similar with his wife. She achieved her dream job and realized after a couple years, she was not fulfilled. She resigned from her job and is doing various part time gigs to find out what she wants to do. My buddy supports her in her journey. Dream jobs are generally overrated. Work will always kind of suck whether it is a dream job or not still a job. Whats important is what you do with your time and money when you are not working your identity both as a couple and as individuals should not be defined by your job seriously, though, why are not you guys engaged? Dont waste time. Build your lives together as one actually commit. Show her that you love and support her no matter what, and she will follow your lead, probably time to drop the offs thing and start being someone she can trust to walk her through life.

My man and I have been together for years. I often feel the same feelings you do that. I am living a better version of the life we envisioned together by myself. Cold, hard, truth is, she can have that dream and life too. My man can, too. But you can only make so many excuses not to do things before they pass you by completely. You can only avoid failure for so long before all chances of winning disappear. The best thing you can do as her long term partner is to encourage her to continue to make changes that bring happiness and fulfillment in her life, because she is not mad. You are living her dream. Shes mad, she isnt, and she is mad at herself that she can get out of this stuck feeling. If she hates her job that much, she will quit tomorrow and make moves towards finding another income, working on studying for entrance exams.

Its never too late for medical school. My mother started when she was in america. Shes a happy dermatologist. Now it sounds like she has the want to surely she studied and prepared herself the best she could for admissions. Maybe a therapist could help her with test anxiety. Either way, it is never too late.

I get that you want to be supportive but nobody can fix this but her she needs to be in therapy encourage her to get started on that she might also want to take a career assessment test to help her think of explore occupations that she has an aptitude for.

I know it may not be the practical answer, but if you have the means to support her going back to school and trying again is that something she would want to do? I imagine you will be able to help her with her studies. My wife got her first degree but didnt like it. So she is now back in school for a completely unrelated degree, and I am really happy for her if I didnt have the ability to support her to be able to be a student again, we would be in a more unfortunate position.

I know how your of feels. I always wanted to be a pilot dreamed of it for years. However, my eyesight is terrible, and as I got older, it got worse. Eventually I passed the acceptable limit and my dream was over. I can never fly commercially. I spent years in a funk not know what I wanted to do with my life. One day I just realised that if I cannot fly them, I can build them instead. Six years later, I had a masters in aerospace engineering and I love what I do now. Just be there to support your of in every way you can encourage her to try new things and open her mind to new careers. I can pretty much guarantee that there are other careers she would love out there, as others have suggested. She may be depressed and need professional help. So please look in to that.

That quite difficult to deal with. Either you find her a therapist or be the therapist you just have to understand what she really wants. I was looking how to establish a relationship with new girl, and luckily found the following website. Go for the free version and enter any mail.

Good for you for putting yourself out there. In the dating scene, this guy does sound promising same place in life. Similar interests. Good listener and I am glad that you are excited about seeing him again. I would suggest, though, take your time dates is nothing. Watch how he interacts with other people, particularly servers, retail people, etc. Confusion. Is he respectful of them? Watch how he responds if you tell him no to something. Listen carefully to how he speaks about his deceased wife. I am not saying he should act like she was a saint. But listen to see if there was respect and affection. If he says, does something that hits you the wrong way do not make excuses for it. Trust your gut. In such a case, we re given the gift of intuition for a reason. I would hold off on the bringing treats thing for a bit. Offering to buy lunch is enough and thoughtful enough. At this point, I sincerely hope that this guy is as good as he seems, and that this does turn into a great relationship for you sound like you are a lot of fun. Good luck.

Jot down little things that he says he likes or places he wants to go or see like a museum or a park or a lake. That way you can come up with date ideas as well. It will let him know that you are listening and care about him. I am super happy for you. Best of luck, please keep us updated. Smiling face with heart eyes.

You might consider a card something expressing that you are happy having met him something you can write a little message on saying it is wonderful to meet a gentleman and that you are excited to see where this might lead or that you are really enjoying spending time with him or something to that effect I know I would consider it a very nice gesture and it would be touching to me

I am so happy for you. This is a lovely problem to have met someone and be worried about how strongly you feel if you can try to take it slow, enjoy these early heady days of romance with a new and fascinating person and cherish all the small moments remember that you will both be on your best selves behaviour and that any major dealbreakers in his character might not show up for a good while. What about a heartfelt card or note scented with your perfume and either some home baking or a box of his favourite chocolates? A lot of men would also appreciate a bunch of flowers so you could try that if you feel he would like that. I hope you have a wonderful next date together. It is such a rare and lovely thing to find someone you click with

Title: Brand new romance advice for me confusion.

So it is been years since I have confusion dated but finally decided maybe I should try it again and signed up for an online dating service. I met someone who seems to tick all my boxes. Lives in my city, owns a home, kind loves dogs, financially stable, not rich, but in my same ballparkconfusion hobbies in common has close friends and family. We ve had two dates, and we are both totally infatuated. He also relatively new to dating widower, but some years out from losing his wifeconfusion he retired. I retire next year. So reddit, he is absolutely delightful. We had an instant connection and spent our first date talking for hours. This does not happen often for me. What usually happens is someone talks. I listen.

Title: My confusion, boyfriend confusion hired his childhood friend confusion as his maid personal assistant.
Thread
My boyfriend and I have been together for years. Our relationship is great, and we have experienced a lot of great times together. We both are very career driven and live separately because it is more convenient because of work. I do stay over a lot at his house, but like to keep my apartment as my own personal space eventhough, we are both pretty busy. We always manage to make time for eachother. My boyfriend works at a law firm and started his own business last year. So he does not really have much free time since the start of the pandemic. He has been working from home, and he usually likes to spend the free time he does have hanging out with me or going to the gym. This pretty much leaves him very little time to do any house work or cook, so he pretty much orders food daily from a couple of local places and cleans his house. Once a week, he has talked to me about hiring a personal assistant who pretty much does everything he does not have time to do. They would basically cook clean, do his laundry, go grocery shopping and run errands for him. This way he would be able to live healthier and better, since he would not be eating take out every night, and his house would be clean and presentable. He has a childhood friend who I have pretty much known since the start of our relationship. They are pretty close friends since theyHave known eachother for over years. She is great and we like to hang out all together. She has helped him through some struggles he had when he was younger, so they trust eachother a lot. The friend has recently been going through a rough time. She broke up with her longterm boyfriend, who she lived with and also lost her job. She lives in her own apartment now, but is having a hard time financially to help her out. My boyfriend asked her if she wanted to work for him as his assistant maid, untill, she found a stable job. I had no problem with this because she also was there for him when he was struggling, and I want her to be in a better position. She accepted the offer. She has been working for my boyfriend for about a month. He pays her good, she does her job well, and objectively, the situation has been great. But somehow, over the past month, I have started feeling weird about this whole arrangement, and kind of built up some jealousy. I guess she works days a week for him and does everything she cooks, makes meal preps for the days she does not work cleans, does his laundry and his grocery shopping picks up packages for him. She is still a friend, so my boyfriend is still pretty informal with her. Since he works from home, they pretty much spend a lot of time together. The days she works and cooks, she joins him orUs, depending if I am able to come over that dayconfusion for dinner. He also lets her drive his car to run errands. I know she is working for him, and she is getting paid, but it still feels weird that she is doing all these personal things for him cooking, doing his laundry and other things to take care of him, almost being a wife. I feel like those are things I want to do for him. I want to take care of him like this, and I feel weird that another woman is doing. It has been nicer for our relationship since his house is now nicer, and he can spend all the time he does have with me. My friendship with her is still great, and nothing has changed. I just have this weird territorial feeling over my boyfriend, my boyfriend and I are both very mature, and we trust eachother, and normally I would think that something like this would not bother me. But somehow, now I feel weird. I have not really talked with my boyfriend about this, because I do not want to come over as insecure and controlling. How can I deal with this situation in a mature and rational way without letting my emotions get the best of me?

Why is everyone being so mean op you are being very rational about your irrational ness lol youre just experiencing some jealousy that is all take a deep breath and remember who you are and who he is you already said you trust him and you are fine with the friends too also you should definitely see the benefits of having help especially someone close cause then it is does not feel like someone random is snooping through your things not sure how to replace your worry besides you mentally knowing that there is nothing going on maybe to ease you is to make dinner together with the friend and invite her to eat maybe ask her if she would help you around your place

Honestly, this sounds like a perfect situation to me. Your boyfriend has more quality time to spend with you, and you do not have to waste time doing chores to take care of him. The only issue is it is an unusual setup, and it makes you feel uncomfortable and your feelings are valid. I would have an honest conversation with your boyfriend about your feelings to explore why you feel this way and come to a solution together. Is it because she is his friend and you are worried he might develop feelings for her. Would you feel totally comfortable if he hired someone he had no relationship with? Or is it more that you feel guilty because you think you should be doing these things? If so, maybe talking about it with your boyfriend or a therapist would help you let go of that. Also try devoting one or two nights a week to date night, where you cook for him or the two of you cook dinner together to have that time where you are taking care of him. Otherwise, it sounds like this arrangement is working well. It may be that just the fact that it is unorthodox, uncommon is making you feel uncomfortable. Maybe give it some more time to clarify your feelings. But from where I am sitting, I would love nothing more than to have your arrangement. I personally dislike cooking, cleaning and laundry. So paying someone to eliminate those chores sounds like a dream

I have an old friend who only ever wanted to be a doctor. Shes taken the mcats, the us admissions testconfusion times in the past years. She has not gotten a high enough score to get into a school she wants to go to. Shes still working at the part time job that she had while studying. The first time your of is not alone. And this type of reaction can happen even without a significant other in the same field. She needs therapy to come to terms with her changed circumstances. She needs to grieve this dream and find a way to find a new one. This is a mental health issue, not a you issue. All you can do us encourage her to talk to someone and support her. I want to believe that once she gets help and is in a healthier headspace, she would hate to know that you considered giving it all up.

After years of undergrad and years of masters, I decided to pursue my career in a different field. It was not easy, and I got a few rejections. My then boyfriend, who was already in this industry, made no effort to help me, but sat me down and told me that maybe I did not have the aptitude for it. I broke up with him days later and decided to do it for myself. I made a plan and studied hard. This time, I had more motivationconfusion did whatever job I could to gain experience, faced more rejections from the company I wanted to be in years later, I finally got in at a more senior level than my ex. I pinged him and thanked him on company. Im some of the things you can take away from this. Only she can help herself. She has to find the strength to try again, support her, help her understand that the fear of failing should not hold her back from living her dream. What is the worst that can happen? She fails again. Clearly, she will survive it, honestly succeeding now will be more rewarding than before. Her story will be more badass than yours. Not discounting your successconfusion

What did she score on her mcats? How did she do in undergrad? What kinds of courses did she take? In addition, where was she applying for medical school? My brother has almost million dollars in student loans. He has bachelor degrees, masters degrees and his grades, gpa and cat scores were so terrible that the only medical school that accepted him after applying for years was a satellite school program in the caribbean, where the cost of living was insane. He finally graduated medical school years ago. It took his years to become a doctor, but he did it. He put in the work never stopped, never gave up because it was his lifelong dream. I told you this story because from your description, it sounds like your girlfriend should keep on trying. If this is truly her dream, her lifelong dream she cannot give up if she gives up. I promise that she will regret it her entire life.

I withdrew from college and it took me a while to feel like I had not just fucked up my whole life. She needs to grieve the life she thought she would have and meet herself where she is now. Has she considered therapy to help her find her footing and decide what she wants to do next.

To be honest, your path to success here is a much more rare case than hers. What she is experiencing is what of the population go through. You cannot pursue your desired dream because you do not have the qualification, could not afford the education, life circumstances, etc. Its very natural for her to feel terrible about this. However, if this is the dream she wants, then she still has the time. If you or her family can support her, its only a dead end if the finances are not possible. Otherwise, tell her to live life and pursue other careers that maybe more suited to her and brings her joy.

She needs to get past this. Frankly, she is the one hurting herself. It probably very difficult for her, but there is nothing you can do to fix it, I would say find a gentle way to bring it up. Maybe ask how work is going, how she feels about her job career ask how she feels about you continuing in your career. Find a way to explain. You can see what she is going through and just want to help her. Of course you are not the person for her to talk to about this. So suggest she find a therapist to speak to make it clear you want to help her through this and help her find a path forward where you are both happy and fulfilled in your careers.

Your girlfriend and yourself need to just realize that there are things in life that are unattainable to us no matter how much we want them. I am not sure how she is managed to reach this age without having a grasp on this simple concept. Careers such as medicine require more than just passion and drive. You actually need to have the academic aptitude for it there, no getting around that. And if she has not accepted that about herself and her own academic limits, she is going to hold you back and punish you in the long run. I am also picking up gratitude vibes from you, judging from your early history with her family. It almost as if you feel you owe her for being the one to emulate her dad instead of her. Imagine a future where you are all gathered together as a family, and you and her dad get to talking medical related stuff. She is going to be one of those that get up from the table dramatically and locks herself in the bathroom because her feelings are hurt, and then it will be your job once again to bring her back from the edge. Now, imagine also having to tip toe around her. Whenever your jib is brought up, it will never end. You will never be able to take joy and open pride in your career, because here is this albatross around your neck who still has not gotten over her hangup. This relationship will not lastThe resentment and anger, especially from her, will kill it from the inside.

She needs to learn to cope with her own emotions, and you can support her in doing that by encouraging therapy. This is not your problem or responsibility. Life does not always work out they way we want, and that is not your fault.

Look, she cannot hack it as a surgeon or even a go. If she had half a brain, she should know that you can take the mat more than once. I know someone who took it times before he got it.

Getting rid of the problem by you quitting or set does not acc help her it only erases the problem rather than having her work thru her deep rooted issues therapy is better dont sacrifice ur career cuz this issue might turn up in another form later if it is not addressed healthily

You cannot light yourself on fire to keep others warm. She is unhappy because she has failed to achieve her dream career. If you give up on yours, it will only hurt you both long term.

I agree that therapy would help. As a psychology student, I can say that usually when two people are very common in career interests and good at the same thing or in your case want to be good at the same thingconfusion, it can cause a ton of jealousy in the relationship and feelings of competition its not your fault and it is not her fault but therapy is a wonderful option so she can understand and control some of those feelings that she is keeping bottled.

You to tell her to find her passion and you will support her my father was very successful in the corporate world and I chose to work in government to help people guess who was more happy me his and my mothers love of money made them miserable your wife can be successful in other ways and have just as much impact as you and do not be surprised that she ends up more successful her problem is she is comparing herself to her father she is her own person so she needs to be herself.

The only fix is to get her into therapy and to help her find something she genuinely enjoys in that order, because unless she has the therapy first, she will not likely be happy about any other job.

Sit down and talk, find out what else does she like? What fields do interest her help her get into those fields basically support her in finding something she likes, even if it means she has to start over from scratch.

It not too late for her to try again. Bro when you become a surgeon and make that dosh try and support her into getting back into it if it is not possible for her due to the difficulty or just incompatibility of the subject help her achieve a different kind of success that would be hers alone. She will be able to overcome her father shadow if she has her own successful path.

As someone who was in a similar boat to your of I would suggest she meets with people who also struggled and managed to go later in life also get therapy because it is a heck of a let down when you feel you cant I hope she realizes it is not that she cant and that it is honestly never too late. I understand it is hard and difficult seeing loved ones go through it and as supportive as she is, there is a pain she needs to seek therapy for op keep being a support and ask her if anything to write down what she would want in years time and if she sees medical school and becoming a doctor as a dream, she should not stop herself. There are a lot of resources online and students who have not gone until after they have done something else and came back

A cognitive behavioral therapist would do her a lot of good. She all have a safe space to talk about her feelings and perceptions, and she will get tools and recommendations about how to deal with this. I am also a woman, very career driven, and I am studying in the stem field. Everytime I failed a milestone, I was appalled. I can confidently say that I understand the pain she is going through. Your girlfriend needs to know how to keep going, no matter if it means pursuing her dream again or just finding a new one. Recommend therapy support her and let her make the final decision. It will make her feel better.

Title: How can I help my of confusion cope with the fact that I am confusion living her dream and she is not

Its a long story. Il try my best to sum it up. I confusion lost my dad when I was a little kid growing up. I spent a lot of time at my best friends house. That friend has become my girlfriend when we were in high school, and we are still together almost years later. Her dad is a surgeon and a very charismatic person, and naturally, we both wanted to be like him when we grew up. Here comes the rough part. I am currently training as a surgeon in her dad field. My of never passed the medical admission test and has gotten more and more stuck in another field in the last years since I began med school, and she didnt. She has not moved on a single bit. Its recently gotten worse because we are both beginning our careers after university. I like mine. She is unhappy with hers. I am now wondering if, just by living our common dream, I am doing more harm than good to her, I would never want to break up with her. You can tell how important we are to each other.

The best thing you can do is be supportive and patient as she explores new options if she opts not to explore thats not on you or about you.

Ask her what she wants to do. Would her becoming an in be a step that would be good for her? It still medical but not surgery?

What stopping her from going back and doing the test now seems like she might be giving up after a bump in the road, maybe encourage her to try again and help her study.

If she is emotionally weak and could not pass the entrance exam this career maybe was not for her unfortunately kind of sounds like she was pursuing it only because of her dad and therapy can help her address that and maybe even help her find a career more suited to her personality and abilities it would help to deep dive which parts she failed and look at careers that maybe do not require things like problem solving or analytical thinking or whatever it was maybe an alternate related field like patient advocate administrator or he

Has she thought about becoming a veterinarian, being a veterinarian myself. I can say the job is not without its downfalls, but it can be an immensely rewarding career path as well. Depending on your country, many schools will accept people with less than perfect grades if they can demonstrate long term commitment in terms of volunteering and working in animal related industries. Also plenty of opportunity to do surgery even at the go level.

Title: Girlfriend is depressed after an abortion.
Thread
Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

Title: I confusion do not want anything to do with my dad anymore
Thread
So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in. Mins was supposed to have an hour. At that pointconfusion, yells at me to make my bed just as good as his wife had it. Before I arrived repeatedly yells hes leaving right now. While im in sweaty, smelly, workout clothes with no time to shower before a two hour, drive calls me. I tech repeatedly and calls me stupid, tells meI remind him of everything he hates about my mom puts down my grandpanrets who have passed away on the other side of the family told me I need therapy told me he knows all about why my ex husband left me told me the reason I will not go to therapy with him is because im scared I will find out the truth that it is all my fault kicks me out of the vehicle in february in canada with my suitcase while calling me bitch tells me not to attend his funeral amp do I need to stay in contact with this man I can not be a good partner to my boyfriend or a good teacher to my students when I am being abused and wrapped up in anxiety with this insane so

Did she have an actual abortion, or is it plan? Tell her plan does not actually kill the developing fetus that might make it a little bit easier. Being disappointed that she did not allow a pregnancy to begin versus ending an already developing one.

Year old male here. I once was dating someone back in college. We started of as friends as the years went by, we felt more for each other and started dating. However, I was much more invested in her than she was in me, which the half naked picture of her and her fiance I saw on her instagram confirmed. While we still were dating, it been almost years since this happened. I really have not recovered from it since then. People keep telling me to work on myself, which I always have been since iv always been goal oriented. I am fit. And though I am no prince charming, I do look good. I have hobbies, a well paying job and I play sports, so I do have a life, but I just cannot, for the life of me, be able to date women who are interested in me because the prospect of me getting attached to anyone is just scary. I do not approach anyone anymore, too, because it just a constant fight in my head to preserve myself and my mental health, because all my thoughts take me to the last experience I had, which was not fun at all. Having that said, I do feel the isolation and the lack of a significant other. When I go to parties where all my friends are in stable, happy relationships, not perfect, but satisfactoryconfusion hookups have never been my thing. I blame that on the sexual abuse I received from my teachers back inSchool, I put myself out there and I might even start talking to someone, but that is where the whole thing ends. It is like a cycle, meet someone new. Start talking, and then it just starts fading away. The whole thing just seems to mentally drain me. And lately, I have been doubting if I feel anything for anyone at all, iv done everything I could to get me out of this space, but nothing seems to work.

Youre you have many years ahead of you. If all goes, well, look, I have been sexually abused, and I have been terriblyconfusion hurt by prospectiveconfusion partners. Part of moving forward is realising that, well, it is actually pretty normal to run into all sorts of dickheads when you are out there dating. Its just that most people do not have a traumatic background that makes those things feel extraordinarily painful. I have been on a handful of dates in the last years. They all sucked. Well, some were ok, but none of the guys were actually into me, which, isstatistically, not that weird. A lot of women have many dates with men who are only looking for sex or who present themselves in a way that they think will appeal most to you for selfish reasons or just do not click. I know people who have a first date with a new person once a week. I tried it like times. Every man and woman has shitty dates stories. The difference is that every time I had a shitty date or shitty person I was seeing for however long I would spiral into thinking there was something wrong with me. It takes me months to recover every single time, because at the end of the day, there is something wrong with me. I have a low self esteem. Its improving. Thoughconfusion and I have been through some truly horrific stuff. Every bad thing that happens is amplified and it hits me so much harder thanIt would a regular person because it hits me where it hurts. Dating is supposed to be a pretty natural thing. You meet someone you might fancy, and then you see if they are what you want. You show your personality, they show theirs. You find out if those are compatible. And if the other stuff is a match as well, sexual chemistry and libido humor, social activities, hobbies, friends, goals, ambitions, sometimes a couple of those fall short. Sometimes you find that out after a while, and you go help guess this was not a good match. After all, for most people, when there is not a match, they shrug or they feel disappointed and sometimes even sad. Most people do not question their worth as a prospective partner, because they are pretty secure in their belief in themselves. I suspect that when you date, you focus on doing it the right way you try to be, whatever it is you think is the best you are more concerned with, how they feel about you than how you feel about them like an audition or job interview. Its a performance. People usually do not like that. They want to see the genuine you. I used to think I attract assholes. But the thing is, the assholes do not care if you are doing a performance, if your behaviour is all about pleasing the other person and being whatever they want. Well, there is a particular group of people that gets off on that. Its theKind of person that does not give two shits about what you feel. They can be shitty and get away with it because you lack self respect and confidence. My advice stop dating for now. I think you have a lot of healing to do. If you are strong and secure in who you are, your values, your likes and dislikes, it does not shake you up as much when someone rejects you, the sexual abuse part probably requires therapy. Look into ptsd, rejection and abandonment are strong fears for people who have experienced traumatic events and who have had few positive experiences. Part of growing your strength means understanding that you can withstand rejection and abandonment. Its also possible that you do not treat women as people, but more a means to an end that sounds harsh, but when you date, do you actually focus on her? Do you see her for who she actually is or for what you hope shel do? For you end your loneliness, give you physical comfort, not just sex, but hugs and touch something virtually every person enjoys, from those they trust. Speaking for myself, I was so wrapped up in just wanting a companion that as soon as someone was remotely compatible, I would overlook red flags, ignore gut feelings. My behaviour changes. I am not the me I am around friends, I am not at ease. There is a certain desperation, and it is noticeable for me for now, it is too soon to date. I haveSome stuff I need to work on. I inherently want to please those that I feel could offer affection that absolutely started in my childhood when I had be perfect in order to get a crumb of affection from my family. I am so used to not being wanted that my reflex is to try harder and be better instead of realising that, hey, this person does not want me, and I do not want someone who does not want me until I feel like I can date without losing myself without going from funny, smart, outgoing, spontaneous to nervous wreck. I am not doing it in a while. Il start with low stakes dates as in not hype it up in my head first, but just experience a regular old date. Experience is key there. In the meanwhile, il be doing things that build my confidence and belief in myself, not just as a person but as a woman worthy of love. What works for me are things like improving in sports, finishing, hard tasks, treating my home and my body in a mature way, having meaningful friendships, with deep conversations, mindfulness, being alone, being adventurous, trying things that frighten me, and none of that, because I want to be more lovable or desirable. But because I want to grow as a person and invest in myself and my friendships. If you feel lonely, you might be lacking connection with people in general, even if you have friends, how many of those people do youTrust with your thoughts and fears. How many people do you actually count on and ask for help? How many of them do you keep at a permanent arms length because you fear that if you lose them one day itl hurt too much if the fear of losing people holds you back from connecting to people you have already lost in trying to avoid the pain that everyone experiences you are causing something much worse loneliness.

Is not old. You sound pretty superficial from the fact that you understand you need to be fit and have money when people tell you to work on yourself, that more means work on your mentality read, watch stuff. Educate yourself. Work on your intersocial skills, have your mental and emotional health in check. Stuff like that is what people mean when they say, work on yourself. Now that you got a bit more insight on what work on yourself means go do it if you are still stuck with your ex. Sure you cannot have a relationship

You are getting in your own way. What you need to do in working on yourself is face your demons. All of them, I know, because I had to do the same thing when I had to find a way to cope with my ptsd from being in the military. Here is what I advise. Lay down on your back every night before, going to sleep, breathe deep and start facing your demons one by one and rise above them. They have no power over you anymore, then you will start to heal. After that, you need to confront your biggest challenge yourself. You are putting yourself down in thinking that you did something wrong in the previous relationship, but the truth is, your ex is the one that did sure you are no prince charming to some women, but to others, you very well may be. So I do not consider myself the best looking guy in the world, but I am confident, intelligent, strong, working hard in my current job and getting my education to get a better job. I have been in relationships with quite a few women, so if I am worthy to be with someone, so are you start healing and do better? On a side note, you are still very young, much too young to give up so quickly

Do not be so hard on yourself. I went through the same ordeal. She came back to my life in a touch and go. The second time took me to suicidal thoughts. And a psychiatrist, what I learned years later is that she was not worthy of me. I am a professional with two masters and have had a great life confusion once I saw her in a mall passing right in front of me. Guess what? She was trying to hide behind her current partner. I felt so redeemed. Why? Later on, I searched well, she had been bankrupt twice, and her current husband, who is an ex cop, at least once she has an, is in accountancy and is financially a total failure. And so her entire life in her adult life, after she left me for the second time she have lived a life without credit. I do not have a day without her popping into my mind for many years. I thought that I was the failing one. Nowadays, I have thrived, have had a perfect and productive life, even at my age, confusion. I have women in their early approaching me. So I have done and still doing well. She left your life because she was and is not good enough for you. God, heard her thoughts and protected you by taking her away from you will see one crossing your path that will wipe her off your mind, hang in there and forgive yourself for getting involved with a worthlessPerson and forgive and forget her, too.

I have had a similar experience at your age now I am and I am here to tell you that you cannot run from your problems I did and will forever pay the price. Define yourself as a person who falls but is able to get back up face things head on and although things are going to turn out badly, sometimes know that you will be working on getting yourself to a better place and eventually you will get there.

So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in. Mins was supposed to have an hour. At that pointconfusion, yells at me to make my bed just as good as his wife had it. Before I arrived repeatedly yells hes leaving right now.

There is no possible reason for you to stay in relationship with such a mentally emotionally and physically abusive person the fact that you mention needing to be a good relationship titleconfusion and good occupationconfusion as a reason that you need to be free of such severe stress makes me feel that you do not believe your own needs are important they are looking at your father behavior it is easy to see why you do not understand that you are precious that does not change the fact that you are what would you tell your very best friend in the whole world about staying away from such a person

If and when you continue to work on this, I would very directly address the shock of finding out this information, but also any other similar shocks you have ever had in your life. Some people, physical bodies, have a harder time with shock. Specifically, I do not think there is anything wrong with you just have to address it. Sorry, this happened to you.

You are. Why is this even a question I get that there is abuse nuances that I probably do not understand. But for fucks sake, why have not you been no contact for a decade already? Are you in therapy? If not, get in some and scream, cuss, throw shit, whatever it takes to remove this guy from your memory?

Please do attend his funeral. And when you go up to the coffin, put a picture of your mother in his breast, pocked so she will always be over his heart but by all means, go no contact. He sounds awful.

So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in.

No, you do not. And for your mental health, it sounds like you shouldn. My mom is a real pos, and I stopped talking to her completely after my grandparents died. Then I found out that is the death of a grandparent is a somewhat common event that adult children stop talking to toxic parents after

Its ok to cut out toxic people, no matter who they are to you. I remember the peace we felt as a family when we cut our dad out of our lives. He came back when my mum passed away recently. We thought he had changed, but took a week before he started being a tech about all the things we are doing wrong, such as my divorce, talking about my mums family and worst of all, digging around what is happening with inheritance, some people do not change anxiety surrounding family and home life consumes you put yourself first because he is not going to do it. Surround yourself with good energy

Can you go no contact with him? No. The question is, why are you still in contact with him? He does not deserve contact with you or with the rest of humanity for that matter.

There was a point I wanted to kill my dad cause of his narcissism and abuse towards my whole family. I always struggled with the idea of cutting him out cause he is still family at the end of the day. However, it is also soo, toxic and draining. I would leave him and focus on yourself until he gets the help he needs that or just keep him cut out. You never know. Things might change down the road as he ages.

That pretty awful. You have the right feelings about avoiding him next time. Listen to yourself and do not take the easy option. The reason he offered you is to get that feeling of power over you back. Don surrender it again.

Making me want to speedup his funeral timeline after reading this, I would end him if I was in your position. So in comparison to that, you just totally cutting ties with him is not that bad, right? He does not deserve anymore of your time. Stop talking to him. Dont answer his phone calls, dont reply to his texts or emails. Do not let him hear your voice or see your face again. He is miserable, and he has made his life that way. He pushes others away and treats them like shit. He is manipulative and only wants you around to have power over. You never give him that power again.

Honestly if your feeling guilty or something about it, even after how he is treated. You look at it from another perspective. Would you want one of your students to be treated like this or go through this? Would you want your boyfriend to go through anything like this? I know what it is like putting up with parents like this. And I am sorry you still feel like you have to deal with it. Please do what is best for you and those around you that care for you.

Year old male here. I once was dating someone back in college. We started of as friends as the years went by, we felt more for each other and started dating. However, I was much more invested in her than she was in me, which the half naked picture of her and her fiance I saw on her instagram confirmed. While we still were dating, it been almost years since this happened. I really have not recovered from it since then. People keep telling me to work on myself, which I always have been since iv always been goal oriented. I am fit. And though I am no prince charming, I do look good. I have hobbies, a well paying job and I play sports, so I do have a life, but I just cannot, for the life of me, be able to date women who are interested in me because the prospect of me getting attached to anyone is just scary. I do not approach anyone anymore, too, because it just a constant fight in my head to preserve myself and my mental health, because all my thoughts take me to the last experience I had, which was not fun at all. Having that said, I do feel the isolation and the lack of a significant other. When I go to parties where all my friends are in stable, happy relationships, not perfect, but satisfactoryconfusion hookups have never been my thing. I blame that on the sexual abuse I received from my teachers back inSchool, I put myself out there and I might even start talking to someone, but that is where the whole thing ends. It is like a cycle, meet someone new. Start talking, and then it just starts fading away. The whole thing just seems to mentally drain me. And lately, I have been doubting if I feel anything for anyone at all, iv done everything I could to get me out of this space, but nothing seems to work.

Op I want to encourage you and say, you are going to be ok. It is rough after a break up, you sound like a really great guy. I believe you have not met the right one. Yes, you should seek therapy if even in another country by zoom, I firmly believe in self care, especially mental health.

Lost the ability based on the context you gave us. It sounds more like unchecked trauma and commitment issues. People keep telling me to work on myself, which I always have been since iv always been goal oriented. I am fit, and though I am no prince charming, I do look good. I have hobbies, a well paying job, and I play sports, so I do have a life, ok? But part of working on yourself is also therapy. It sounds like you still need to go down that route of therapy too.

I can empathize with your feelings after being in a long term marriage of years that was mentally emotionally at times physically abusive I ended it he committed suicide later that night I finally remembered he raped me early in our relationship that I remembered finally last year he cheated on me at least times that I now know of I had no self worth but I chose to save myself instead of him even his last words to me were manipulative I called him on it as I walked away he knew then that he lost control he had severe bipolar borderline personality disorder and he was a master at manipulation with me part of his behavior I can blame on how his father beat and molested him and his disease I had watched him fade away rapidly over the last years he did not work or have any hobbies but thankfully I had my best friend confusion who was in a similar relationship that would talk with me and ask advice I started to finally see the red flags in my own life then my first love confusion came back into my life we started talking a lot getting closer he asked if I was really happy because I was not sounding like the girl he knew after thinking hard about that I realized I was not happy and finally left I chose me and told my ex I could not save him I have to save myself I have been lost not knowingWho I really am. I have lost my identity of who I am. Without my ex. I started counseling. It is called trauma counseling, and it is doing amazing things for me. I know my story is long, my apologies. I wanted to give a little background. I am finding it very difficult to open myself up and be vulnerable again. I am also suffering from extreme independence, which means because my trust has been broken. I could not rely on my ex. I do not want to accept help from others. In my trauma counseling, I am learning that I did not give up control, and im still there. Even though im hard to find with the tools im learning, im able to work through my stuck points, learn to open up. Im learning what I enjoy doing, and im finding my voice again. One of the best things I have learned so far that I use each day is to ask myself when I go to the dark or depressed feelings, is this fact or feelings? Is it fact or habit? Trauma counseling is wonderful? And after what you have described, I urge you to try it. I will keep you in my prayers.

If you dont have therapy in your country I would suggest going on youtube and looking at better bachelor he walks through a lot of real life examples dating profiles articles etc that outline the exact type of behavior you witnessed your not alone there are a lot of women with this mentality men too for that matter but I would suggest better bachelor so you can understand the mentality in order to help you avoid it some of these women have been so indoctrinated and confused by and wave feminism and wokeism they do not even understand themselves they re both poisonous the society as a whole and constantly getting contradictory information shoved down their throats and for the haters I am differentiating and wave feminism from real feminism which just seeks equality

What you are talking about here sounds like ptsd to me, especially when you mention things like past sexual abuse. No one on reddit is going to give you advice that will change your life. You need therapy. Ptsd cannot be willed away. It has to be treated just like any other serious internal wound. You need a surgeon. You cannot do this on your own, just like you cannot perform surgery on yourself. This is serious, and if you want it to change, you need help.

Hi, you have been through some really rough stuff, but I think that everyone expresses love in different ways, and maybe you have not found that one person just yet the kind of person you feel like talking to everyday and wake up next to, I can guarantee you that you can love and be loved just like everyone else. If you cannot find a therapist that you like and feel confortable, what about talking with a friend or someone you really trust? I am really sorry. You feel like this, but remember, you are progressing each day and you are doing the best you can

I get it. I am like you in a lot of ways. I am currently seeing a counselor to work through a bunch of stuff, but I understand your fear and anxiety, something my counselor told me really hit home and helped me gain a different perspective. Allowing yourself to be vulnerable is scary, but never finding love is even scarier. Basically, what I took away from this is that a lot of things in life are scary, but their counterpart is even worse. You cannot blame yourself for every relationship failure. Some people just are not a good fit for you. Having healthy and positive self talk is the foundation of a positive self image. Dont allow one negative relationship dictate the next years

You are allowed to be disappointed, angry, upset, however, do not allow these emotions to control you cloud your life. Give other women a chance, because sometimes, attraction isnt always instant. Some people need emotional connection to be attracted to someone.

Hey there, friend, it sounds like you got hurt pretty bad. I do think you should take a step back from romantic relationships and focus on healing yourself from this hurt. Love is about putting everything into one person, go out and make friends travel a little bit, do something you would not normally do. You might be surprised what you find along the way. Therapy is probably a really good option for you, too. Sounds like you have some healing to do. Love is also about getting hurt. You have to be ready for it or at least willing to, except that it is a possibility thats life doesnt mean it does not suck. I hope this helps you just a little bit. No, you are not alone, and it is not uncommon to feel this way

I would suggest finding another therapist I am on my third one and can tell this one will be more helpful than the other two first helped with a situation at the time so I cannot say they did not help the second one did nothing the third one has a treatment plan and asked a lot of background info to know where I am at so try another therapist and if this one does not work look for another there a lot of baggage trust issuesconfusion you need to unpack before you can move forward none of it is your fault some people are awful and take advantage of others

Sounds like it is time to look into a therapist they can give you the tools to work through that fear and start building meaningful relationships again it hard to let go of past trauma but it is worth it eventually maybe do some reading online there is plenty of articles around trauma and methods for moving through it other then that might be time to expand your hobbies find something that will increase your pool of friends connections therapy great but nothing motivates change like a goal connection

There is absolutely no harm at all in remaining single and not being romantically attached to anyone. There are millions of people who lead very happy and healthy lives on their own with no partners. Some like you had an experience that just caused them to swear off it, and they just live their lives for themselves. They are happy, are comfortable with themselves and no longer need a partner to share their life with. You can live with looking on others who have it with a disinterest, it is not for you and not what you want in life. And that is ok. So if you do not want to do it and you do not ever want to place yourself in that vulnerable position of feeling affectionate or romantic with someone else, then just don get on with living your life and doing what makes you happy.

While we still were dating, it been almost years since this happened. I really have not recovered from it since then. People keep telling me to work on myself, which I always have been since iv always been goal oriented. I am fit. And though I am no prince charming, I do look good. I have hobbies, a well paying job and I play sports, so I do have a life, but I just cannot, for the life of me, be able to date women who are interested in me because the prospect of me getting attached to anyone is just scary. I do not approach anyone anymore, too, because it just a constant fight in my head to preserve myself and my mental health, because all my thoughts take me to the last experience I had, which was not fun at all. Having that said, I do feel the isolation and the lack of a significant other. When I go to parties where all my friends are in stable, happy relationships, not perfect, but satisfactoryconfusion hookups have never been my thing. I blame that on the sexual abuse I received from my teachers back inSchool, I put myself out there and I might even start talking to someone, but that is where the whole thing ends. It is like a cycle, meet someone new. Start talking, and then it just starts fading away. The whole thing just seems to mentally drain me.

Dont give up. I am telling this to myself too. These people are simply not the right ones. Weve got to stop giving so much credit to marginal efforts when there are way too many other red flags when it is right, it is easy.

Here. This will probably fix this tldr. This is fear is not what you think it is. And once you figure out what it really is, you be able to dig into it and get everything you need to know out of it, and then no longer have it stand in the way confusion. It always means something opposite enough of the problem. Circumstance matters. Anytime you have an awful feeling, you are experiencing the world in a backwards land framework. It a mirror image of your circumstances to impact your forward motivation. Whether it is the pull of positive association or the push of negative association, both all boils down to how your brain gets you going in the right directions. It means the fundamental meaning of either kinds of emotion is going in the right direction. Now here is where it gets tricky. Negative association works kind of like a cue ball on a pool table, hitting a ball, if it forms right, it hits hard enough and in the right way to get you going enough in the right direction, but it is hitting how things seem to you hard enough. And unfortunately, if you keep remembering that this is really all about going in the right direction, it cannot hit with the kind of intensity that has actually going to make the right kind of impact. So this is kind of like a two for one deal, you re going to be able to get rid of the uncomfortable feelings. The fearGives you and you are going to be able to get the data the fear gives you because the way that you fix this is translate every bad feeling into the opposite of itself but without the extremes think opposite enough you ask what opposite enough of this but also circumstances are layered so your emotions are going to be layered so you got to ask yourself what is bothering you about the circumstances that bother you and remember any bother is about a negative association because you have to remember backwards land gets tricky and you cannot count on anything in backwards land translating one to one with forward thinking because backwards land also has to twist things to make them seem worse enough to motivate you but once you start exposing what matters in a forward direction for each thing you find in backwards land it starts to make backwards land lose its lustre as the way to understand everything I want to also say that this is a lot different than positive psychology of which I feel downplays the problems themselves and which can cause a person to blind themselves to genuine problems and the need for adaptation

Therapy when people say work on yourself they do not mean distract yourself with work and hobbies and working out they mean work on the problem you are having you can try to do it alone and that does work for some people but I do not recommend it even if it does work and does not just turn it into something else you do not want bouncing around in your head it is going to take way longer and be way harder than if you had someone who is specifically trained to help you in your corner steering you in the right direction and giving you validation and support

It never easy to put yourself out there because you are making yourself emotionally vulnerable. However, by not even trying, you are letting your former girlfriend impact your life, even though she has moved on. Don let her ruin your life. She obviously was not worth it. You can find the right person. If you do not interact with anyone. It may take a long time to find a person you feel you can trust. And I think it is wise not to rush into anything however, please keep trying. You all never know unless you try. When youi meet someone. Take it slowly. If nothing else, maybe you will find a new friend.

The moment you accept that you may very well be alone, you will feel happier you re already doing things on your own, which is great. And I know the loneliness can get to you sometimes, but if you try to consciously stay single, it takes the pressure off wanting to be romantic, you be happier, and then people will magically start to be more available to you in every wayconfusion.

Maybe not feeling anything is your body way of coping it your body alarm system that is telling you that do not feel for anyone since you are still not over your past traumas seeking psychotherapy is the best option here

I have and still experience a lot of things you do. One thing I can recommend is looking into therapy. It a hard thing to talk about, but it can be life changing. If you can find a good therapist, you could maybe look into the therapy apps. If you do not have anyone locally, you can go to sometimes those are nice too, because it is a lot less pressure.

Look, man, you are the only one holding you back. Fear and anxiety are very real, but avoiding them, like you are, is not. Copingits a slow death. Your are living an empty life vicariously through your friends that would feel more like a tomb. Albert einstein once said, a life without mistakes is not a life worth living. God bless dolly, if you want to see the rainbow, you have to put up with the rain, and if you do not like the road you are on, pave a new one. I was assaulted by a man at work in my. I wanted to un alive myself. As a teen, I was bullied and had a dad who took years to finally understand me. By the way, am gay, hate, sports and spicy food, which made me the weird one. I spite of my anxiety, I somehow managed to become the person I wanted to be. So as yourself, what you want to be and be ok, knowing you have to become someone else to do it. Who your are is already broken. And with a little work, you can make those pieces become something beautiful, but you and only can do the work. Find a therapist, maybe a new one. Dig into yourself. Introduce yourself to who you want to be and find out how to be happy, alone in a corner with a puppy and a goldfish, because then you can handle your own silence. You can make room for someone else. TheWoman who cheated. That was her mistake, not yours. Those people who assaulted you that was not your mistake either. Free yourself to make your own mistakes.

Title: I confusion do not want anything to do with my dad anymore
Thread
So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in. Mins was supposed to have an hour. At that pointconfusion, yells at me to make my bed just as good as his wife had it. Before I arrived repeatedly yells hes leaving right now. While im in sweaty, smelly, workout clothes with no time to shower before a two hour, drive calls me. I tech repeatedly and calls me stupid, tells meI remind him of everything he hates about my mom puts down my grandpanrets who have passed away on the other side of the family told me I need therapy told me he knows all about why my ex husband left me told me the reason I will not go to therapy with him is because im scared I will find out the truth that it is all my fault kicks me out of the vehicle in february in canada with my suitcase while calling me bitch tells me not to attend his funeral amp do I need to stay in contact with this man I can not be a good partner to my boyfriend or a good teacher to my students when I am being abused and wrapped up in anxiety with this insane so

Honestly, I cut out my dad years ago for less in the moment. It is stressful, especially if you have anyone in your ear giving you the but he is your dad, as if it is supposed to be some sort of qualifier for putting up with all the abuse and negativity. Once you rip the bandaid, though it does get better in the long run to have that sort of toxicity out of your life and a bit of advice for the future. It does always suck a little to reflect on choosing to cut a parent out of your life, especially if you are talking about it with people that have always had nothing but a positive dynamic with their parents. Its a big thing. And for some people, it is just a foreign concept that a parent could not only be bad but bad enough to not want them in your life. Youre going to get people that are just so steadfast in convincing you to make amends, even though they will never comprehend what they are convincing you to do. It sounds weird, but I have ran into more than one person that just insists on me burying the hatchet as if there is some sort of imbalance in the universe. If I dont hell. Even my mom mentioned it recently because he was in the hospital with health issues, even though she herself has not talked to him in years. Ultimately, though, just remember, the why like the stuff you saidIn your last paragraph about not being able to be a good partner and teacher because of it. I do not want to assume you are anything like me but I guess I am trying to warn you to not get trapped into having regrets later. The absence sucks, but the presence sucks more if that makes sense.

Absolutely not. You do not owe this man a relationship. I am close to your age, confusion. And a few years ago, I started abruptly cutting off people who are toxic, abusive. And honestly, I have zero regrets. I have too many amazing relationships in my life to tolerate people that treat me like this. I am so sorry you are going through this.

No. Consider him as having died the day of the funeral. Abd take him at his word and do not bother to show up at his funeral unless you feel like dancing.

Op you do not have to allow anyone who treats you with disrespect to be a part of your life. You father is abusive, and there is no perfect way for you to be or act that would stop the abuse. The abuse has literally nothing to do with who or how you are it about who he is, and you have no power over how he chooses to act. Give yourself the gift of no contact with your abuser. It ok to grieve never having the father you deserved while you create you own chosen family.

Never ever talk to him again. I am your age, and I went no contact with my dad for the hundereth time in december after having tried and tried and tried. And he was nowhere near as bad as what you are describing. If I can offer any advice. Thinking of it as a grieving process has helped me. I am allowed to miss the good parts and the good parts that I wish had been there, but actually weren having a relationship with my dad at all, etc. We will reach the acceptance stage and move on

After my dad passed away when I was, my mother became absolutely insane, mostly emotionally abusive, but would be physically abuse as well, especially towards my younger siblings. The physical abuse subsided as we all got older, and I spent a good years of my life justifying her actions because she did have an extremely traumatic childhood. I started getting help and going to therapy. I would encourage her to do the same to work through her issues, but she refused to get any help. The one day, she flipped out on me again, and I was just absolutely fed up with her behavior. I told her I never wanted to hear from her again. I blocked her and cut her out of my life and never looked back, coming from a hispanic background. Huge importance is put on family and supporting your parentsconfusion. A lot of people said I was overreacting and should give her another chance. Some would make me feel guilty by saying I was the eldest and it was my responsibility to take care of her. Thankfully, I had a handful of friends who knew what I went through and supported me, and a great therapist who supported my decision. Also, it brought my sister and I closer as well because she did the same thing a few years earlier. It been more than years since I had any contact with her, and my life has been so much better for it. I am still working on myself, but I feel withoutHer in my life, I am able to focus more on my own well, being it one of the best decisions I made for myself and I have never regretted it for one second.

I decided to cut contact with my parents when I realized no amount of distance or time would ever change them. I know that they will never respect me as a person, and we will never be able to have a relationship without them exerting some control over me. What do you get from maintaining a relationship if he was a friend or partner? Would you put up with his behavior? Do you think you would be better off without contact?

Im so sorry for this. None of that is your fault and you do not deserve this kind of treatment. I admire you for taking all of that cause I think I would of gotten up after he shut the laptop and yelled at me, going in my head, here we goconfusion and just packed my shit and literally walked out and found a way home. So no, you do not need to keep in touch with him and I pray you dont.

My dad left when I was and has never tried to contact me or my sisters. I cut my mom out of my life years ago, and let me tell you, it was the best decision for me and my family, although it is been a rough road, trying to heal from all the emotional stress, gaslighting and narcissistic behavior I would cut your dad from your life, only my opinion.

It is absolutely okay to cut out toxic family members. I am so sorry he did this to you. Do not deserve that, especially from a parental figure.

Title: I confusion think my sister confusion is being controlled by her boyfriend confusion.
Thread
Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

Of course you don. Why would you need to stay in contact with an ahole like that? Don let anyone talk you into forgiving and forgetting, because you are faamily. That is the stupidest excuse ever. I have barely any contact with my dad, because he never ever showed any interest in me or my brother when we were younger, and when he was still working, traveling the world, having girlfriends all over the world, that was what he wanted. Well, now that he is almost, he is surprised that no one visits him or stays in contact with him. You do not need to stay in contact with people that are bad for your mental health. Neither your father nor any family or friends that tell you. But faamily, how could you be so cruel to him and not forgive him?

No, absolutely not. He showed what he is, accept it and move on. He is a scared, weak little man who abuses you and others. So hide his weakness. Basically, he is the definition of evil. Stay away.

Please post here instead raisedbynarcissists people who were not raised in abusive household have no idea what it looks like or they are used to fawn and will try to make you have a relationship with him because they are too afraid to cut their own family themselves. Please do not comment or post anymore about this man here and go to this sub. Instead, you will find plenty of people who know exactly what you are living and willing to give you real advice. Im sorry that has to be raised by a shitty person. You have to, right to cut him out of your life, do what is best for you and not what society is trying to guilt you to do

So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is.

Thats a nope. For just one of the points, all of them he doesnt get to have any contact with you or any further grandchildren or their children, etc. Depending on how long he lives, probably not long with his attitude.

If people do not treat you right, then you have every right to think about yourself. He is an asshole. You see it you need to be kind to yourself right now. Keeping contact with him. You are not sympathetic to your own heart. Move away. Keep away

It is perfectly fine to cut off contact with anyone who is toxic parent or not if you feel you need permission for this I give you total permission.

Fuck no my mom is emotionally abusive as well and I have not spoken with her in two years. She likes to show up unannounced and demand things she wants. Then when I enforce boundaries, it is an attack and she plays victim left me a page letter on my doorstep about how I verbally attacked her because I hung up on her screaming at me while I was driving. Therapy on your own might be a good thing when your ready but do not take that shit face with rolling eyes.

Hell to no, this is coming from someone who got abused when she was in a relationship and from my dad. Also don be in contact with him whatsoever. Stop worrying about what other people may think and worry about your happiness. I am a little bit like you, and I grew to the fact that people will not change unless they want you to.

Title: I think I have lost the ability to ever be with someone romantically.
Thread
Year old male here. I once was dating someone back in college. We started of as friends as the years went by, we felt more for each other and started dating. However, I was much more invested in her than she was in me, which the half naked picture of her and her fiance I saw on her instagram confirmed.

I am not a therapist at all, but I would like to give my own opinion only about this of what I think might be going on. I have known a couple of other guys that were like this around your age range. One of them was kind of in the same boat, not too related, but similar, not sure if this is you are very first relationship you have. But I am going to assume it isconfusion, and it is kind of sad. Someone did this to you, especially with along the sexual, which I am very sorry aboutconfusion. But remember, you can view it as a learning experience of what to look for next time. If you find yourself in another relationship, I think the more you dive down this isolation sadness, you are, walls will get greater and stronger, which can possibly make it harder to let your walls down for someone possibly even ruining the chance to meet someone is trustworthy, which leads me to my next point. Either you are afraid to fully trust someone, be attached, or trust yourself with them, or both from you are situation. But there has to be a deeper reason than finding yourself of why you have been feeling this way for years and cannot seem to let it go. I suggest a therapist to help you professionally, because it is not very healthy. I know these things can be really tough, and I honestly wish the best for you. I am sorry if iAnswered this late, but I really hope this helps.

It sounds like there is a lot happening and my condolences, it sounds like you have tried many things to get out of this, but I want to make sure, though, have you tried therapy? Talking about it is a good start. But getting some real help. Not from randos on reddit might be the right move forward here.

Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby.

I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this.

This is information that I wish I had when I went through this almost a decade ago first thing, something that might be hard to deal with but might explain a lot is that most of what is going on has almost nothing to do with you and close to do with what is going on inside her body. From what I have heard from women that have had natural miscarriages, they have the exact same feeling of having killed their baby like it is their fault, even though they had no control over it. From what I have read. There is a science to it that our bodies pump us full of hormones that make us feel horrible so that we do everything in our power to make sure that this never happens again. Aka, we make sure the next baby is carried to term, no matter whatconfusion and from what I have read, our bodies cannot tell the difference between a chemically induced miscarriage and a natural one. It was really hard, because I had felt like I did something wrong, and I wanted someone to blame. So I blamed my husband, and he took my blame by the barrel full. I had gotten part the worst of these feeling after about months. The thing that actually helped me the most through this that was the most difficult for my husband at the time to be okay with was actually just letting me cry. He wanted to prevent me from being sad, but actuallyCrying helps us shed toxins from our bodies, aka those yucky hormones that are making us feel terribleconfusion, and it makes our bodies release what I like to call natural antidepressants like serotonin and dopamine. That is why we always feel better after a good cry. I used to do this one of two ways either I would watch a really sad movie and cry, or I would start an argument until I was so mad, I would cry. I let you decide which one is the better option. Eventually, I got my husband to decide that letting me be sad at movies was the better option, and our relationship greatly improved. The second thing that really helped me was throwing myself into something distracting for me that was figuring out a way to make sure this never happened again. I wanted a tubuligation, but my doctor wanted me to try all the different birth controls before he would agree to do one. I had been on nova ring, but that had proven to not be very good at keeping me from getting pregnant. Later, I found out that none of them really are effective. Sounds really good until you realize that just means one out of every gets pregnant. So it is really just a numbers game. But I went through them one after another, and the high levels of hormones all made me sick that why I had been on the low level nova ringconfusion until finally they agreed. None of them were goingTo work for me and gave me my surgery that gave me such a great sense of control that I have never felt. It is like again. Now I get to choose exactly when I get pregnant, although honestly a much easier path to the same outcome would have been to just get a vasectomy for my husband. But at the time tubuligations, we are covered by my insurance, and a vasectomy was not covered. My husband, which I still think is kind of fucked up since his procedure would have been an hour office visit with a one to two day recovery while mine was a three hour surgery with a month recovery. The last thing I really wish I would have known back then is that tubuligations and vasectomies do not mean you cannot have kids, they do not stop you from producing eggs or sperm. They just cauterize the delivery system. You can still have kids via ivf, or if you want a bunch, you can just have it reversed. And if my husband or I had one of these procedures earlier, we never would have had to have a chemically induced miscarriage in the first place and would have avoided all the emotional trauma that came with it, and I would not have had to deal with all the mood swings and general bitchiness of being on birth before that either. The more you know, I guess

One of my best friends had an abortion back in. She was devastated, she was mourning for months. Of course, in some point, she will be back to be functional, but for the moment she needs you to be comprehensive to her, be there for her and just be patient therapy. It is a great option for her to let go. Eventuallyconfusion, this traumatic episode of her life, anti abortion people tend to think this shit is easy, but honestly, it is heartbreaking. In so many ways, you guys will be okay. Just be patient respectful and be there for her good luck heart suit.

I had an abortion and it messes with your hormones. She all be all over the place. It maybe worth trying to get her some help with a doctor, either with talking therapy or she may need some antidepressants until her hormones settle back down. You re doing a fantastic job at being supportive and for reaching out for help too. You are a good person. It gets better with time, I promise.

I was in the same position as your of but I believe I did not take it as badly though this depends I knew for a couple weeks before the procedure whereas with taking pills she might have only known a couple days confusion regardless her feelings are completely normal but beside that they will get a lot better soon I remember clearly noticing the difference between my opinion on unrelated situationconfusion before and after the hormones pregnancy hormones are nothing like other cyclical hormones and are not only scary but also overwhelming give her time both to grief and for the hormones to calm the down in the meantime the best you can do is be there

I went trough the same when you get pregnant, all your body changes the sensations, sense of smell sensitivity. And when I did my abortion, it was first of all, a painful process that lasted a day and second, an experience that is not at all casual, and it my be traumatic. Also, all the hormones are in your body. After that, the process of going back to normal, just talking about the physical part of this process its impossible to be in just a day. So now think, if you mix it with the psychological part, give her time and a lot of love. The things that she is feeling in are stronger than you think, and just in case I am pro choice.

It is a full blown grieving process. The hormones are in the works as well, and no matter how pro choice a woman is, its still a choice to kill something inside her. That is very precious, especially when it happens in a committed relationship thats heading towards child rearing, confusion. I think a choice like this is as selfish as it is selfless, since you are admitting some feelings towards the embryo yourself, maybe having a sort of funeral for it, or write it a letter and burn it together. You made it together in a beautiful way. It helps to say goodbyes in a similar manner I had a miscarriage many years ago. I was considering abortion, but then decided against it. Then I spontaneously lost the pregnancy. Me and my then boyfriend had a bath together. We cried and talked about what the baby would be like, what we would be like. As a family, we vowed to make sure the next embryo we create will be well taken care of. Then we got out and pulled out the plug. It was very helpful to have this moment of acknowledgement and shared grieve.

Saw that it was mentioned she had an i'd be careful with those my family have only had bad experiences with them my aunt had one and it dislodged and cut a hole in the condom there even a tiktok trend of filming them fall out I should clarify they show it on the floor not their bodiesconfusion which also happened to my family some people are more prone to problems due to the shape of their anatomy for me personally, the implant is safer and less likely to cause damage fall out I am planning on getting one fitted in the future my cousin still had an issue with hers but it was the side effects of the hormone not the efficacy I have been on the mini pill for years so it is not an issue for me that gets fitted in your arm and releases a hormone at the same time each day so it should be fine but make sure to find what is right for her. You also have patches like the nicotine quit ones but with hormones instead they get placed on your stomach usually. And traditional pills also work but make sure to reliably take them every day within the hour window there more out there but those are the most used. I think if the i'd failed you something went wrong and it is definitely worth it to swap forms it the best when everything goes right but if something goes wrong it is a lot harder toStop pregnancy than say the pills where you can take it within a hour window and still be ok or the implant, where it is easier to book an emergency appointment to get it refitted because it just goes in your arm, the i'd is also pretty invasive to the point where she could have flashbacks to the abortion, which is very likely, as from what you described, it has caused a very intense experience of ptsd. I think for her mental health alone, it is worth considering her options. Take what I say with a pinch of salt, because I have never had to suffer through an abortion. I just know a lot about contraception because of my family being pretty open, and doctors giving me the full information to make informed choices. Ultimately, what works for you guys will not work for everyone. I do not know what country you live in. But regardless, the nos has lots of free, useful information on the various forms

She needs to see a counsellor or psychologist to talk out her grief and emotions I had an abortion over years ago I did not see a counsellor at the time and instead dealt with the pain in very reckless ways including becoming an alcoholic and getting a very serious dui I had to defend in court I do not even want kids and it was my idea to get a termination but I still grieved for the life that could have been and it was traumatising to go through the procedure its normal to grieve and be sad you should encourage her to talk about it and to discuss it with a professional if you look up marie stops they have abortion related grief counsellors

The truth of the matter is that both mother and child exchange nearly every cell in the human body. In pregnancy, brain cells, heart and blood, endocrine, etc. With the early termination, a very special and deep bond is severed, and she still has the babies cells swirling throughout her system. Its a deep injury that affects the whole person, and that severing of cells takes time to wear off. Thereis always going to be grief and recriminations over the abortion. For me, after years, I still wonder who that miscarriage would have become. We had several children in our twenties, and honestly, there is no good or bad situation that can make it a non reactionary experience. Only truly heartless people can make abortion an effortless revolving door. Over the experience, you would not be happy with that person if they were. Its called sociopathic to feel nothing about the loss of another person take time to just listen to her, and when its time to re, engage in relations, I hope you will consider another be besides an abortafacis that only ends a fertilized egg or zygote or fetus, best of luck. And working through this

Offer up a way to honor your baby. Maybe it is a necklace she can wear a picture, etc.

That is so tough. Keep doing what you are doing, providing all the support and comfort to her. Everyone processes grief differently, and there is no timeline encourage her to talk to a good therapist and help find one she may even need antidepressants to help cope, and it is not something she will need forever. However, she is going to carry this guilt forever and always wonder what if hopefully she gets help and advice on how to deal with those feelings? Its going to take some work and a lot of time.

I was in this exact same situation when I was I took the pill, abortion. And after I felt a mix of relief and guilt, I think mine was mostly because if my parents were ever to find out, it would be really bad for me, because they are super conservative and religious. I was a little depressed after, but it was mostly guilt and anxiety. It went away with time honestly, if you can get through this, you have a pretty strong relationship. Something that helped me is to mute certain words on social media. If you can anything related to the topic

It normal. She needs to realise that she was saving that potential child. If she took the pill, it was barely a few cellsconfusion from a life of struggle. No child deserves to be born into a life of struggle. Stress, difficulty. It may easier on the person to think it was not yet even aware it existed or had a thought process. As it was a blob of a few formed cells. It also best she do her best to do things to distract, be cause, thinking about things again and again is how it turns into an obsession and deep roots itself. So if she does not think she can come to peace with the concept, it is best she learns to nip the thoughts on the bud as they come into her head to stop it, spiralling that how I cope with things I know will spiral me into depression.

She will eventually get better over time, but you will need to get used to grieving the death of the baby. My ex girlfriend and I were in our final year of high school and had the abortion because we thought it would be best for us. She was in pain for weeks, mentally and physically. She did not even want to be around me. When I asked if I could see her, she would blow me off. She eventually broke it off because she felt like she was a different person from the one I knew and loved honestly. The best advice is keep being there for her. It may seem like it is all in vain, but she is taking it into consideration. I eventually stopped being there because I was hurting from the abortion as well. And that was the mistake that broke us. Take her mind off of it, but do not make her forget about it, because she is attached to the baby emotionally, forever.

She feels like she killed our baby she did. Bro heart beat develops around weeks in not sure what you want to consider life, but I would say that is a good testconfusion. Ik it is tough to hear, but abortion is usually the wrong choice.

Of course she feels depressed. She killed her child. Be as pro choice as you want out loud. But the conscience undeniably knows what is right and wrong, and it cannot be silenced. Who would not feel like shit after snuffing out their own kids life before they had a chance to live?

Dude, really come on. Abortion is a better gift than pregnancy. It a bit right wing. To have these types of feelings about a clump of cells, it time to look at the science here. You did not kill anything of meaning, plus, its already done. Have you guys thought of celebrating and shouting the abortion to the world? For some grace and acceptance from the pro choice community, many people would help you celebrate this and show you that what she did was actually more brave and feminine than having the baby. Abortion is even better for celebrating because she had the choice and made the one that was right for her. You need to help her celebrate this. Do better

This is what they do not tell you about abortion they do not tell you that you are going to go through nine months of emotion in a short time they do not tell you that you are going to go through nine months of emotion in a short time within a few weeks you are lying to yourself you say you are pro choice me and my wife had a similar situation she was on we both do not have a degree she is not religious I am but both of us was not stupid enough to get involved in relationship without discussing this outcome there is an old tale you cannot unring a bell when pregnancy becomes a different person she will never be the person you originally screwed that woman is gone and is not done going through that change and considering you agree to put her through this, you better stick around till the end and then leavers has what you got to do all those hormones. And I started a motherly instinct my wife stepmother had an abortion at same excuse and why you used and then her stepdaughter had a child at the age of and everytime I see her hold my little boy my two year old I see nothing but regret, happiness and sadness all over face for what could have been all you said is that you took a pill that you get cleaned out that you get scraped out how far along was she you leftOut a lot of key information. So I am putting this together with my imagination. So enough of this back story let me tell you what she is going through. Most women do not want to make that decision, and because you agreed, she was probably felt like she was forced to. She probably expected you to say, no, my wife is this way. Here is number two. She literally killed a baby inside of her, and you assisted. You cannot run, ring this bell regardless how we feel. As a man, she literally killed a child, and as a man, you need to realize she sees herself as a murderer and feels all the guilty goes with it, just like shooting a burglar that is trying to rape your daughter and killing him. You need canceling before she kills herself. I have seen it many times before he planned. Parenthood does not offer this i, but there you have it from a father that had this conversation with her entire family. I went through this with a year old girlfriend that was pregnant, so you cannot really tell me any justification, because I already went through it, but in her eyes, you are an accessory to murdering her child and yours. And that is the kind of help you need to find. Unlike men, women get more of an attachment. Emotional attachment than men do need. A grief counselor, focus on loss, my wife found god. The second that little boy was pushed onto herBoob and it cried for the first time and stop him from crying she saying my little sunshine immediately quiet down she found god at that pointconfusion if you are unwilling to have kids or the responsibility form do not have exit not f hard I get it for years without sex from the age of to you do not deserve to have children ever and on the I excuse of we cannot afford a kid at this point in our lives leave a kid in the basket of fire station no questions will be asked there is so many places to leave a child after birth no questions asked there is so many people that cannot have kids want kids and cannot afford them no questions asked this will probably get my account f band but it is a throwaway account what you expect your murderer you are an accessory to murder and you put a woman that was not ready to make those kinds of decisions through this I we do not know what we want four more years at the and make a big f difference your man, you were supposed to be a father you are supposed to protect your children you f murdered it. There is a special place in hell waiting for you right next to hitler and the sad thing is because you failed as a man in a father you dragged her down with you better get her some f help from a grief counselor of loss beforeShe takes her own life.

My partner and I were in very much the same situation to you and you girlfriend. Its a lot to process and I still get upset about it sometimes but it gets somehow easier with time. Does she have a friend that knows about the situation? Anyone to talk to other than you sounds like she is very upset, though I was upset but I got out of bed and tried to get on with my life maybe gently bring up the idea of seeing a doctor to look into therapy. I really feel you when you said, you want things to go back to how it was before I did too for so long hope everything works out thinking of you both

Hello sorry for the long winded post im stoned but I am what ur life would look like in a few years had you not made the very difficult but correct decision to terminate ur pregnancyalthough I was a bit older confusion and I had a child already who was at the time I got pregnant failed the challenge of making the right decision for not only my current child, but for myself when I became accidentally pregnant in I did what everyone expected of me and continued my pregnancy I had a few people tell me I should abort, but I had always considered myself a pro lifer and said that it was not something I could ever do because I do not think I would come back from it mentally, mainly because I already struggle with severe mental issues. So despite my better judgement telling me not to go thru with it, I had a healthy baby girl, december of and I almost died. I had to have large incisions made to get her out via section and had severe complications, resulting in a day hospital stay. It was traumatic when I got home with my baby. I had a long recovery and could not go back to work as a bartender for months, so we struggled to make ends meet, and I was and still am very detached from my baby. I rarely held her and pretty much wanted nothing to do with taking care of a baby because at the end ofThe day I did not need or want a babybut. The pressure from society makes you feel like you have to keep ur pregnancy, even tho it is not in anyones best interest. I was so worried I would not come back mentally from an abortion. Its been years, and now I am wondering if will ever come back mentally, from having an unwanted child? I love her and would never let anything happen to her. But I find myself still checked out and not really connecting with her. Im mostly emotionally unavailable. So you absolutely did the right thing here. And you guys just need some time to hold and comfort each motherand remind urself that finishing school so you do not end up working jobs, the rest of ur life and end up in a situation you do not want for. Ur future child was the absolute, is the right decision to make. Ur girlfriend is so courageous for making this very difficult decision for her future. Because living with the consequences of falling to society pressure would have been much more mentally destructive. God bless both of you and many hugs. Yall did the right thing and will be wonderful parents when the time is right, winking face, woman shrugging

Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this.

I think it is okay to feel. So eventually she will realize that it was the right choice. The only thing you can do right now is stay by her side so that she feels reassured, safe and supportive.

So it is important to understand that her body will grieve for her. Regardless of logic and rational choices being made together, we are hardwired to want to reproduce and to want to protect the fetus. Listen to her. Let her grieve get therapy, ask if it would help to do something to recognise the baby she is grieving. Sometimes that can help to make things seem more real. Go, then be more able to let go. Unfortunately, sometimes keeping this stuff more private and leaving it as less real world can make it even harder to process, though it does protect from outside judgement and harm share your grief. So she is not left feeling alone with it all. Good luck. Op this is normal for many, and it sounds like you are doing everything right. Unfortunately, the belief that being pro choice and knowing it is a bad time will make it easy can add to the difficulties. As we do not prepare for the struggle, chemically hormonally, she should start to even out in the coming weeks, and that may help, too. The process is very new. Physically speaking. Confusion. Hang in there and make time for yourself and your grief, too.

I have only seen one comment bringing this up but pregnancy hormones will stick with her for a while like her body was literally getting everything ready for growing another human being there a lot of chemical shift that goes into that and now it is like hitting a wall she has all these chemicals that are trying to back off and go back to normal the time this takes will vary depending on her body while you both deal with the loss of this and wondering what if she is also being fucked with by these chemicals in her body best thing to do is to both get counselling it going to take time and best to follow the grieving process don try to stop it let it be what it is a loss

Be with her. Hold her. Tell her how much you love her. Its not easy. And im sorry to say that question will stick with both of you forever. It will be easier time, but just be with her. Its hard and it sucks. Remind yourself why you did it now and time it will be better. I know it sucks, but only time helps. Its not something that goes easy. When I got pregnant, we thought if we should keep it or not, cried my eyes out at the idea of losing the kid I did keep the pregnancy, but for us, it was different. Just be with her. Thats all you can

I did not have an abortion but a miscarriage and felt the same way just hold her and be supportive if it gets to bad. Have her talk to a doctor or going to therapy.

Honestly, the best thing you can do is be there for her. Even consider getting some counseling for the both of you. This is something that she may ever get over. So therapy would definitely be a good idea.

Hi. I have had an abortion when I was years old. We were using a condom, but did not matter. I have not even finished high school, and I wanted to finish my studies and do something with my life. I could not took care of the baby, and we agreed on an abortion. I remember just staying in the hospital bed afterwards, not moving, not saying anything, just silently crying. Although I was young, I knew I wanted kids just not then its been ten years on the of july. I still cannot forget it. What soothes my pain now is my son, which albeit came at a time in my life where I was climbing the company ladder so to speak, and I made a choice. I choose him, although we live in a rented house, and sometimes I do fear that we may not have enough money. I know that it was the right thing to do. You just be there. Dont ask unless you feel she wants to talk. What you are doing is great wish. I had a supportive partner, as you happy face or smiley

You both need therapy going through an abortion for most people, is a traumatic event, even if you think it was for the best, you are allowed to be upset about it and mourn your loss, but still think it was the right decision. You re also allowed to decide after the fact that it was not the right decision. I have a friend who became pregnant after a traumatic sexual encounter and chose to get an abortion every year. She does something small for mothers day and does a little commemoration on what her due date was. She still thinks it was the right decision, but that does not make it an emotionless event. I went through a miscarriage years ago, something that helped me get through. It was knowing that it was the potential future I was mourning, not the fetus. This might be helpful for some people to hear or be absolutely the wrong thing for others to hear. It entirely depends on the personconfusion. The fetus had the potential for life, but it was not yet. A baby or child. Every egg she releases and every sperm cell you produce also have the potential for life, but we do not get upset about them. So it might be helpful to talk about mourning the potential for the pregnancy, but it might also be absolutely the wrong thing to say, I hope you both manage to deal with the trauma and get through it together. Good luck. And I how something in thisWas helpful.

I would advice you both of you to get counseling or any kind of mental health advisory. She not like grieving someone she is actually grieving the loss of her first unborn child, just because the baby was never born. It does not mean he she was not a baby growing inside her. Also, remember that we as men start being fathers months after women. We have to acknowledge the connection they have with the baby is something that we cannot experience directly.

I just went they this myself and I still wonder but know that this was a decision. We both decided for the best us and the baby. We have two kids already. So having a third baby with couid and everything was hard, especially anyway. Just try and be there for her. She will pull thru. I remember every blood clot I felt pass. I felt it was my baby. I cried so much for a few days then went back into routine and it has definitely helped me. But also talking about our baby day of grieving together both my husband and me helped me a lot that he understood what I was going thru

Its normal to feel a depth of loss no matter how seemingly insignificant shes not just morning a baby that was not even a baby she is mourning what might have been the future and that is okay she will probably be upset for a little while the best you can do for her is to be there for her so you are doing a good job its tough for both of you

Hi. I am slightly qualified to talk on this since someone has spoken to me about this, I cannot give any further details about this, as per what I was told. Therapy is the ultimate solution. The person told me that mere support is not enough. You said, you are broke. Do you have any kind of insurance? Or maybe do you have helpline where they arrange therapy for you or something if neither are available? Can you look into this also tell her that she made the bravest choice the best mother could make you were careful. And yet this happened a fetus is not a human. So this happened with no conciousness from the part of the fetus. Would she rather have the baby and put it through pain? A deprived childhood is a terrible childhood leading often to a terrible adulthood. This is the bravest choice she could make spare the potential baby of the pain, and instead take the pain on herself that a brave mom, sometimes it is nobody fault, that it was not her fault. And yet she made the brave choice of not putting a child in pain, rather taking all of that on herself makes her very selfless. Whatever she thinks like killing a child or something she could not be further from the truth. However, right now, I do not believe that anyone but a professional can make her understand that you future child will be very lucky to have you two people who really think aboutThe child I am rooting for you two stranger on the internet happy face or smiley.

I had a miscarriage and it was horrible. Even though it was on the first trimester, I am pro choice. So I was surprised by just how much the loss hurt me, considering the timing of the loss was similar to the timing, many women would have an abortion week confusion. I cannot imagine what it is like to know that you are the person who caused that abortion. If you had any attachment to that pregnancy, its really devastating. Also do not forget the hormones that come into play during pregnancy and for the months that follow go really easy on her, please

I am and had an abortion last fall, my boyfriend and I are both college students, pro choice and in a loving relationship, the pregnancy was intense, but the time after the abortion was horrible. I remember saying to my boyfriend that it feels like something inside me is broken. I did not feel bad about not having the baby. My consciousness remained clean. Nevertheless, I was so sad, and I felt so broken. I cried at nights I could not take care of me. Showering, eatingconfusion. I felt numb and somehow shattered by the experience. I must admit I underestimated the effects of an abortion physically and mentally. The hormones are insane, and the effects and the regulation back to normal takes time. Also, the abortion and being pregnant is an intense loss of control over the bodily autonomy and emotions. Again, hormonesconfusion, this all leads to a trauma. Luckily, I am doing much better now and feel somewhat normal again. My boyfriend was a great source of support. He was just there and stuck it out with me. He let me sleep in his bed. He cooked for me. He waited for me. I could not talk about it a lot, only on a surface level. He accepted that and waited until I was ready to talk. I needed time support and a place for all my emotions. I needed a break. When we both got couid, we isolated together and just lived a very slow, easy life. He cooked. I slept a lotWe talked, and since then, I have been doing a lot better do what you have been doing. Be there for her. Give her time for me. It took almost monthsconfusion and support her as much as you can. It can get better, and it just takes a little bit of patience and trust.

I have experienced miscarriages. It does not matter if it is abortion or a miscarriage in the end, if you are actually for the baby in your heart. Abortion is a decision which should be made by heart, not by head. I am still grieving. Even I have two kids now she allowed to grieve. She is also allowed to feel bad depressed, but she shouldnt be to hard on herself. You did what you thought would be best stick to this thought, take care of her, get her some wellness stuff she can do at home if she is grieving. Alot make a little event for the baby make a little emotional funeral so she can say goodbye. Also, I still talk to my lost babies. Maybe she wants to tell it that it just was not the right time that its soul is absolutely welcome to come back when time is right. She can apoligize to this baby in thoughts. Maybe this could ease the grief. I tell you maybe it endures quite a time, but that is okay. It really is. She had a loss. It does not matter if she knew about it or not. She already loved the baby. Also, I would say, even you are pro choice. Your of does not seem to be in the mindset to actually experience an abortion. It is not the same as being okay with others having them. Im absolutely pro choice, but would never abort a baby, because I know it would killMe inside. Also, if her guilt takes over, please send her to therapy. She does not have to work this out alone if she can wish you the best for the upcoming times.

Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

Your girlfriend body had changed and it was releasing the various hormones and things have been shaken up for her it not an easy thing to go through I have been through this with a partner who did not want children and my partner was very depressed for about a month or so but everyone is different with the grieving timelineconfusion this feeling will pass for your girlfriend it will from what it sounds like you both made a very responsible decision there is no reason why you cannot try again in a couple of years time. Sometimes timing is everything when it comes to these massive life decisions, I wish you both the best

One thing that really helped me after mine had it in decemberconfusion was to acknowledge my love and grief for the child that would not be my partner and I are in love I am on birth control but it happened anyways I oscillated between wanting to keep it and being so scared of not being able to provide because I barely make it every month financially as it is and cannot even afford to go to the doctor for visits I also did not have a place I would be living past the end of the month at that time even now I try to justify it but at the end of the day it just was not the right time. It was very emotionally heavy. However, since I do want kids with my partner sometime in the distant future when life is not complete chaos when I finally had it done, I talked to a friend who had suffered through several miscarriages, and she gave me the advice to acknowledge the child that could have been to write to it or speak to it in some way just to say you were loved very much and this is not because you were not wanted because you were bad because there was anything at all wrong with you. It just the murky circumstances of life that we do not really fully understand it ok to mourn, to love what could have been it gave me a lot of emotional peace to do that.

This would be a good one to have her sort out with a therapist. Maybe they can point her in the direction of some support groups for women in similar situations.

She needs to cope with this herself I think you are doing great, not interfering listening to her. Comforting her dont force her to anything and reassure her a lot that you are with her and she can rely on you for god sake never use. Its not big deal or anything of the sort and dont try to be her psychologist. As this will make things worse, I would suggest professional therapy and I think this is a must remember nothing on reddit is medical advise, so its best to leave such sensitive cases to professionals.

Pro choice all the way pro choice is a women right? I stand firm with making my own decisions for my body, as should every women being as this is effecting you both so much emotionally must be difficult. And im sorry you were faced with such a hard choice. So early on in your lives, maybe she feels like this because it happened all too quickly. These kinds of decisions need time to sink in, and they need alot of thought talking to her, being open about your feelings about it and being there for her is all you can do. And thats probably all she will need from you. I hope she feels better soon.

It normal to feel like that. It clearly was not just a straight, easy answer for you two and you have done what is best for you both. Abortion is never easy. I ended up miscarring the day I went for mine, fell pregnant by a narsatistic. Now, ex, I did everything not to fall pregnant. He tried trapping meconfusion any way you do grieve and wonder what they would be like. For some, it is a longer process than others. She just needs to think how now was not the right time, but she needs to come to that realisation herself. You re doing what you can, and its great to see that you are being so supportive. Just keep doing what your doing. Give her extra cuddles if she wants them

Experienced stuff like this with one of my best friends, not my kid, confusion and seen her go through it. Abortion is both physically and mentally taxing. It can hurt for a long time or even cause long term mental issues if not dealt with correctly, therapy is very important. Once the physical healing is done, keep supporting each other and understand that even if it was the right choice being in college cannot support itconfusion. It can still feel horrible to do. So thats very valid. So please both get some help to deal with this. It is nothing short of intense trauma, skull,

You are not bad people. You made an incredibly difficult choice that many take for granted. You could never have known that either of you would feel the way you do. Now, I wish I had more advice. Give her a cuddle when she feels up to it, of courseconfusion, and let each other mourn, hold space for the opportunity you had to turn down with this pregnancy. Some people like to name their angel babies. I know this is a religiously loaded term. I am not personally. I just think it is sweetconfusion, or do something to keep their memory alive. Babies can be a wonderful blessing, and I truly hope that in the future, you have a beautiful bundle of joy, but please do not feel ashamed that now is not the right time.

Hey, dear, I am pro choice, but I also suffered an abortion from an undiscovered pregnancy. Being pro abortion does not mean you do not suffer the consequences of an abortion just that you accept that it should be safe and accessible for everyone who needs it for different reasons, including the ones that took you and your girlfriend to take this option is easy to mourn over what would have happened if, but that lives in the fantasy of our heads. And not in the harsh reality of bringing a kid into a life of necessities just to avoid feeling miserable ourselves. But the grieving is real. I would recommend you and your girlfriend two things one, a psychologist make sure, is a pro choice, one, not someone that will act in an unprofessional way and make your girlfriend feel judged or worst, because it happens more often than one would like that. A psychologist let us its own belief system on the way, and two in funeral homes, they usually have free meetings for people going through grieve, specialized in different types, and most include groups for women grieving over their abortions. I think if she finds a place where she can open up and validate her feelings right now over this topic will help her heal with other people that will understand her, and she can feel identified with. I hope you can go through this. I still grieve my lost baby, but I made the peace with it a long time ago,Sending my love towards you two don let this change your point of view over pro choice please. A lot of people and kids really rely on it right now.

If you seriously think taking a life or not allowing a life to continue will be forgotten and you would have moved on after a day or so then you are no where near ready for a relationship of course she is grieving she was pregnant there was proof she had someone inside her wanting to make a cosy temporary home honest to god if you already know you cannot afford a child use protection I can soo tell this was not a come together and talk about it decision feels like you basically pointed out all the negatives then proceeded to try push her to that agreement for her to not get out of bed for a short term pregnancy like that means you had a lot to do with it excluding the pregnancy honestly I hope she dumps you happy face or smiley you now know you are a boy and not a man

For those who may be in a similar situation now or later, there are other options. Instead of going through the pain and regret, you can have the baby and immediately put the baby up for adoption, there are waiting lists of people ready to adopt.

I met a brazilian woman years ago in the usa to make a long story short I worked remotely at her home in brazil then she lived with me in usa for months and now I here again in brazil she always been a difficult person but we worked through things and I extremely patient she praises me for my calmness and patience but it is wearing thin. Here are problems that I think of. She has problems sharing work at home. I often have to remind her to help. She is crazy of insecurities she often asks questions about women on my ig and I have a feeling that my life is under a microscope when I confront her about it, she says, im only asking questions im not accusing you of cheating. I feel gaslighted. Sometimes I think she talks to other guys on ig and projects it on me like she is keeping backup guys and wrongfully assumes that I keep backup girls. She easily gets stressed and lashes out at me. But she is improved since we met since arriving in brazil. She always has some ailment that bars her from activities. We just stay home. She is judgmental of others. Everyone is tacky to her or has complaint about people often complains about pal of different nationalities. We used to bike together. But the past few months has been excuses. Sometimes it feels like manipulation. I dont want to put her in only a negative light. We do have some thingsIn common, like doing exercise, biking, not wanting kids traveling. And our goals are aligned. However, we will start to have visa issues, and I have to marry her to remain in brazil or she return to usa. This ultimatum has me questioning everything, and im starting to think about how my life could be if I were single, working remotely going to europe, road tripping in usa, etc. And to make the situation a little more fun, I left my apartment in usa and would have to decide where to live. I dont want to go back to my city. Tbe im stressed and want to hear advice.

Its funny you say, you have things in common exercising, biking, travelingconfusion right after you said, she does not do those things anymore. Its like you are not self aware that you no longer have those things in common. Shes changed, and you have not changed with her.

However, we will start to have visa issues, and I have to marry her to remain in brazil or she return to usa. This ultimatum has me questioning everything, and im starting to think about how my life could be if I were single, working remotely going to europe, road tripping in usa, etc. And to make the situation a little more fun, I left my apartment in usa and would have to decide where to live.

I had always thought I will best friends with my partner. Thats the dynamic, which always appealed to me. And my ex was like that, but unfortunately, she moved abroad, and it ended. My present of is very good in all respects. She is honest, loyal, great sex life. But somehow I miss the emotional intimacy which was present with my ex. We dont do any couple activities since we live together, so she prefers to go out with her friends, and its not like she comes very late. She is always back by am, but I just want us to do something together. Sometimes, like today, she wanted to go see a play at a theater, and I said, lets go together. And she laughed, you wont like it? And called a friend instead, I dont want to think about past times, but cant really help thinking if my ex was here, we would be out somewhere, just wasting our time. But enjoying every second of it help me out here guys.

Its ok to say your needs are not being met. You have a roommate, you live together, you coexist and you have sex. Occasionally, you do not have a partner, somebody to share you life with, to share ups and downs and experiences. Not everybody wants that, but you do. If she does not, then you are just not good for each other.

There is nothing worse than being lonelier with your partner than you are by yourself. I was in a relationship like that. Good on paper, but lonely as hell, and it damn near broke me. I did not realize how shitty I felt in general and about myself until I stopped telling myself that the way I was feeling was selfish. After I called it off, I realized how long I had been walking on eggshells to avoid more criticism. It was so freeing to finally just be myself and not worry about my partner opinion anymore. Maybe I am reading too much of my own situation into what you have said, but it goes beyond just not having your needs met every time you let yourself get excited to share something important to you every time you put yourself out there and get rejected is one more hurt that changes who you are and how you see yourself. Please do not cower in the corner talk to your of, about how her rejection of time with you makes you feel and if she does not or will not get it, you have got to decide whether you really want to live like this.

I feel like that too sometimes best thing to do is communicate your needs you mention she said you would not like the theatre show did you ask her why she thought that regardless if you would like it or not the point is going together you would enjoy her enjoyment communicate if she does not respect you move on frowning face

Agree with others who have commented that it sounds like you are not getting your needs met, and you should communicate that to your partner, see what she says. And if she shows empathy for how you are feeling, tries to meet you in the middle. I recently went through a similar issue with my boyfriend, and I realized that he cares so deeply about me and the relationship, and was trying his best to make more time for me. And I needed to start working on building some independence, making my own plans as well. Obviously, you know your situation best, and it could be different in your caseconfusion. Hes absolutely great in other aspects of the relationship. And I decided that this was not something worth breaking up over. As I had some trust issues, insecurities to work through again, it may be different for you, but I would go to her and let her know what you need from her. And then based on her willingness to work with, you decide whether it makes sense for you to move on or stay

Read again what your posting and listen to yourself all the things you described is what a great friends with benefits is there is no romantic relationship without the emotional intimacy the fact you ask to go with her and she declined and prefers to go with a friend thats a major red flag in a relationship like you said yourself in changes when you start living together in these days when a modern woman find a man she can lives with she things she is in control and can do whatever they want because most men now are sims and lack the self respect to call it quits when getting disrespected just like girls who breaks the heart of a man often such a man will become a player created out of pain by a woman what you are doing is allowing the disconnect between you should choose yourself thats far more attractive to most woman when you get isolated, she does not want to be seen with you outside the house. How more red flags does have to pop up you know what to do we will be here to help you with the afthermath

In my opinion, I feel like you got to talk with her. Ask her why we dont hang out together often, its a relationship, and people in a relationship do things together and enjoy each other, company people that want to be around each other all the time, leaving the other person behind. And being rude, selfish about it straight to your face is just not the kind of behavior loving people do to each other. Bring up your topic of your loneliness and work it out together. The only thing standing between you two are yourselves free your concious and be open with each other.

Year old male here. I once was dating someone back in college. We started of as friends as the years went by, we felt more for each other and started dating. However, I was much more invested in her than she was in me, which the half naked picture of her and her fiance I saw on her instagram confirmed. While we still were dating, it been almost years since this happened. I really have not recovered from it since then. People keep telling me to work on myself, which I always have been since iv always been goal oriented. I am fit. And though I am no prince charming, I do look good. I have hobbies, a well paying job and I play sports, so I do have a life, but I just cannot, for the life of me, be able to date women who are interested in me because the prospect of me getting attached to anyone is just scary. I do not approach anyone anymore, too, because it just a constant fight in my head to preserve myself and my mental health, because all my thoughts take me to the last experience I had, which was not fun at all. Having that said, I do feel the isolation and the lack of a significant other. When I go to parties where all my friends are in stable, happy relationships, not perfect, but satisfactoryconfusion hookups have never been my thing. I blame that on the sexual abuse I received from my teachers back inSchool, I put myself out there and I might even start talking to someone, but that is where the whole thing ends. It is like a cycle, meet someone new. Start talking, and then it just starts fading away. The whole thing just seems to mentally drain me. And lately, I have been doubting if I feel anything for anyone at all, iv done everything I could to get me out of this space, but nothing seems to work.

So the person you were dating was secretly already engaged, cheating. That sounds traumatic. You also mention not wanting to get attached to people and sexual abuse. Have you talked with a therapist? Psychologist before that might really help you sort out through your feelings from these bad experiences.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with you, and I bet you have not lost any ability to be with someone. Life has dealt you a rough deck of cards, but recognising this is the first step, which you have. I read above. That therapy is not readily available in your country, which is a shame. But I have a friend who has a therapist in another country. She zoom calls her. Is this a possibility for you? Do you think I am sorry you are going through this and I am sorry. It feels like there is not any light at the end of the tunnel one day down is one day closer to you, feeling slightly more open towards somebody new. It is not easy to just chat to somebody new, and it hopefully develop into something

I met a brazilian woman years ago in the usa to make a long story short I worked remotely at her home in brazil then she lived with me in usa for months and now I here again in brazil she always been a difficult person but we worked through things and I extremely patient she praises me for my calmness and patience but it is wearing thin. Here are problems that I think of. She has problems sharing work at home. I often have to remind her to help. She is crazy of insecurities she often asks questions about women on my ig and I have a feeling that my life is under a microscope when I confront her about it, she says, im only asking questions im not accusing you of cheating. I feel gaslighted. Sometimes I think she talks to other guys on ig and projects it on me like she is keeping backup guys and wrongfully assumes that I keep backup girls. She easily gets stressed and lashes out at me. But she is improved since we met since arriving in brazil. She always has some ailment that bars her from activities. We just stay home. She is judgmental of others. Everyone is tacky to her or has complaint about people often complains about pal of different nationalities. We used to bike together. But the past few months has been excuses. Sometimes it feels like manipulation. I dont want to put her in only a negative light. We do have some thingsIn common, like doing exercise, biking, not wanting kids traveling. And our goals are aligned. However, we will start to have visa issues, and I have to marry her to remain in brazil or she return to usa. This ultimatum has me questioning everything, and im starting to think about how my life could be if I were single, working remotely going to europe, road tripping in usa, etc. And to make the situation a little more fun, I left my apartment in usa and would have to decide where to live. I dont want to go back to my city. Tbe im stressed and want to hear advice.

I am much older than you are. And hindsight is, but life is unpredictable, and everyone is experiences, though there are similaritiesconfusion, can be so different, it really depends on who is in your life, your family, close friends, acquaintances, work and location. I am thinking back to my time being and what advice I would give to myself. One thing is, for sure, life absolutely can throw curve balls, and it can knock you off track fast. I think if there was one piece of advice, it is to get use to the idea of starting over, get real use to that. And if you can manage or master the art of starting over, you be alright. You mentioned being a goal oriented person, and I was, too, for a very long time, still am. But the problem with goal oriented mentalities, especially when it comes to the heart and people, is that there is no way to goal orient your way regarding. People, are the ultimate chaos particle. They have a way of shattering any goals or expectations you might have. The most unpredictable nature about life is not nature, but humanity laughing out loud. The thing about people is that you cannot plan, which is why trust can be difficult. And that is something most children grow up to learn. One disappointment at a time. I see a lot of people my age these days, parents with kids and the innocence of children how easily they trust and freely they move about inThe world like nothing weighs them down because nothing does. Yet. Children have no baggage yet. If they are unfortunate enough to be born into an abusive family, they lose their innocence quick and through no fault of their own, that just life. And that is why the mastering the art of starting over is probably the best life skill anyone could cultivate at you are not so old as to be completely hopeless about future prospects. You absolutely can and probably will meet someone again. Don give up hope because it is not happening in a time frame that other people expect when it comes to meeting the right person that is not something that could be forced. Also stop comparing your life with your friends. Do you realize how many people are in unhappy relationships and marriages? Simply because they cannot bear to be alone? They rather stay in a bad relationship? I know people in miserable marriages and people coming out of marriages after their wife banged their work mates. The amount of divorced men and women and single parents is nuts. The grass is always going to look greener on the other side, but people have skeletons in their closets, and friends rarely tell each other every single detail about their relationship problems. I have seen enough to want to be happy, single than miserable with another person. Two miserable people starting a marriage and raising kids is also trauma to the next generation born in those environments. Even if you findSomeone there is no guarantee that you both get married and die in your old age at the same time. There are plenty of elderly people who live the tail end of their life alone because their spouse died years earlier. Plenty of people who meet their loves and lose them in their from disease. Not everyone is guaranteed the disney life. And even if it looks that way for years, it can change in an instant due to innumerable circumstances. Life can be a dice throw away from curve balls at any moment. None of it is guaranteed. Speaking from my own experience, dating in my late to is an absolute landmine because of underlying trauma. Many adults experience and have not dealt with properly. I was never the hookup type had serious relationships, never had a casual relationship, never been cheated on, I would say, a relatively low key lifestyle, but very ambitious. In so far as my education career, I have not gone on a single date for going on years. Now, the last person I dated was a man nearing his mid, and was still dealing with a lot of unresolved issues from his past and did not understand how to effectively communicate in a relationship. It was a lost cause some people are not willing to do the work to change, and either you accept them or leave them. I left if you think it is tough now at, wait until you are, or I have been exploring spirituality for awhile.Now. And it is helped me a lot. It taught me to love others platonically without expecting much in return. The strange thing is, when you get to that point where you can love others. Platonically, it tends to attract a lot of people towards you. Both good and bad, just be smart about who you let get close to. You don be a bad picker. Be wise about it, just because people start coming out of the woodwork. To be close to you does not mean everyone should be master the art of starting over, explore spirituality and deal with your trauma. Truly deal with it so you can actually move on and not go in circlesconfusion. Humanity is the ultimate wild card. Don be a bad picker. Be wise about it. Life has no guarantees. Hope for the best, but prepare for the worst is, I do not think you have lost the ability to actually be in love. I find it is fairly normal and common, especially more. So for men, since men are not as socially connected as womenconfusion to feel this way when they are not in a relationship, it more common. The older you get, because friendships tend to veer off into marriages, family life. I think therapy to deal with your past spirituality, to move forward, reconnecting and socializing with a larger community would help volunteering time and helping others and doing altruistic things can help with learning how to reconnect with other people. I do not think itIs healthy to rely solely on your significant other to fulfill every aspect of you. Co dependence is not healthy. It can last for awhile, but no single person is meant to fulfill every single need. It is not possible even if they try. Co dependence is like vampirism sucks your life dry and leaves a shell of a person.

I feel like I can completely relate to everything you have said. Its uncanny. In some weird way. I feel like people like us sort of just fall in love with ourselves. I am what is referred to as a sigma female. So definitely independent and quite content with my own company, I have concluded I am just going to have friends from now on who can join me to parties or events, no expectations for anything beyond a plutonic nature. I do not want to be intimate with anyone again, at least at this point. I am leaving the man I love today, and I am getting on with my lifeconfusion. Perhaps youl feel contented with doing the same as far as just having plutonic activity partners.

It seems the biggest issue is your fear of commitment or becoming attached. You need to face that head on next time you start chatting with a girl, one who you truly would like to get to knowconfusion, make yourself push forward, continue conversations get in depth with her. Maybe you make a very good friend. Maybe you have a new of you seem to be blocking yourself. I get that it is rough. You have been through hell. But remember, it wasnt your fault. If you let this affect the rest of your life, then it will be good luck.

Year old male here. I once was dating someone back in college. We started of as friends as the years went by, we felt more for each other and started dating. However, I was much more invested in her than she was in me, which the half naked picture of her and her fiance I saw on her instagram confirmed. While we still were dating, it been almost years since this happened. I really have not recovered from it since then. People keep telling me to work on myself, which I always have been since iv always been goal oriented. I am fit. And though I am no prince charming, I do look good. I have hobbies, a well paying job and I play sports, so I do have a life, but I just cannot, for the life of me, be able to date women who are interested in me because the prospect of me getting attached to anyone is just scary. I do not approach anyone anymore, too, because it just a constant fight in my head to preserve myself and my mental health, because all my thoughts take me to the last experience I had, which was not fun at all.

Oh, this post looks like someone wrote my story abuse, minusconfusion additionally to being cheated on by a guy who was secretly engaged I have had no friends, the people I had or I thought I had chose someone else over me always I started distancing myself to the point that I have no one to hangout. No one invites me to their wedding or lets me know anything important happens in their life. I have seen only terrible marriage around me, starting from my parents to siblings that thinking about marriage totally rips my heart open. I have started to feel guilty to even think about having a good life coz I feel I will not ever get it other than this. I dont have issues what? So ever good looking, earning more than average. But lack of people around me somehow weights everything else. I have resorted to social media and almost every ott platform to exist to keep me distracted, which I know is toxicconfusion. Hope replies from here, help me too

Youre not preserving your mental health, though avoiding romantic relationship years later, after an experience like that shows there is still some parts on the inside that seriously deserve and need your attention. Gym, healthy food, hobbies. Goals are all great, but you have to target the sore spots of your mental health and heal those to get better counseling. Just so you have someone removed with experience to talk to, can help you challenge your beliefs and cope with your fears and potential disappointments. Maybe if your really desiring that, now you can intentionally looks for someone who is struggling to trust again, too. You guys can make an pact for a set amount of time to just treat eachother with love and compassion and snuggles, no strings attached, just to get comfortable with dating again, intentionally shoot, for having a really positive experience, and see if, after the set amount of time, if you guys feel better about entering into dating again, like exposure therapy with a buddy edit I saw where you said you have been to counseling. Trauma is not just from death and violence. Im not diagnosising or anything, but avoiding situations that remind you of the experience is a common symptom, especially if it lasts for years. Maybe a psychologist, an actual doctorconfusion would be a better fit

I completely understand every time I think I should open up to someone, they prove it is not worth it. I think I am done. I have been hurt enough times, and these damn women will not take no for an answer. They show up at your house, even when they know you do not want to be with them. They try to pressure you into sex. And the ones who are not doing that are trying to pressure you into getting back out there. Look, men do not owe you anything. I get that I have a house car. Decent job. I am not a hideous chud. People seem to like me. And some even think that I am funny. That does not mean I owe it to women to want a relationship with some random girl, just because she decides I am the one currently. Girls think I should belong to them, I guess that is how the world works. Dudes who want a relationship or sex cannot find it. And those of us who do not want it have it coming from all sides

I am so very sorry that you went through all those horrible experiences. It breaks my heart. None of it is your fault. And although you say, you know this, I cannot help getting the feeling that you might unconsciously feel undeserving. I wonder if it is the fear of history repeating itself, or if there is something else making you sabotage any possibility of getting close to anyone, let alone a potential partner. Of course, I may be wrong, but do you have any real and meaningful emotional connections with anyone? Because my sense is that you blocked cut out all emotional vulnerabilities out of your life to be able to truly love and be loved back can only fully happen if your wall is down. I am talking about love. In the broadest sense for a family member, your best friend and others. Are you able to be truly vulnerable with anyone at all? In my humble opinion, this might be where you be able to find a part ofconfusion, the solution from the bottom of my heart. I hope you find the enlightenment you seek. So you live your life, the way that makes you and all you love, happy and fulfilled. A great, big, warm hug from me to you. It be alright

Working on yourself does not mean just being physically fit. You got to work on your mental health and emotional issues, too. You have past traumas, you need help. Working through finding a good therapist might help you with both things. Best of luck, I hope you figure yourself out.

Oh man as soon as I read that bit about your last relationship, everything else just kind of makes sense it horribly traumatizing to be cheated on but to find out they had a whole fianc while you were dating is just all the more heartbreaking the really only advice I have to share is what I would do personally at this time I would focus on the existing relationships you already have I feel that after such a betrayal that was your last relationship it would also be hard to trust others in your life and you feel you may have no particular feelings towards anyone but maybe it is your brain just trying to protect itself from potential hurt I am not you and I really do not know but really at this time I would not be focused on a relationship so much but maybe work on the friendships you already have or just to really meet new people just as friends. I know this may not be what you think you need, but having a good setup of support people you love can be really good for healing. Working on yourself. Have you tried any kind of therapy this could help you work through things in a more productive manner. Maybe help you work through trust issues. Previous trauma. Anyway, I am not exceptionally helpful, but I really do only wish you the best happy face or smiley goodluck

I had a similar experience. My first real girlfriend in high school cheated on me twice. We had been together almost yearsconfusion. I did not seriously date for about years after we broke up. I ended up meeting my now wife while on a trip out of town with friends and instantly connected with her. When things started getting serious, I was getting cold feet and was getting scared. She almost broke up with me because I would not commit to her. I realized that I am self sabotaging a healthy relationship with an amazing woman, and decided to jump in with both feet. That was about years ago now, and it was the best decision I ever made. Also, therapy has definitely helped me. I do my sessions almost exclusively over, zoom as well, which sounds like, would be a good fit for you if therapy is not readily available, where you are located, hang in there. And best of luck,

Here are problems that I think of. She has problems sharing work at home. I often have to remind her to help. She is crazy of insecurities she often asks questions about women on my ig and I have a feeling that my life is under a microscope when I confront her about it, she says, im only asking questions im not accusing you of cheating. I feel gaslighted. Sometimes I think she talks to other guys on ig and projects it on me like she is keeping backup guys and wrongfully assumes that I keep backup girls. She easily gets stressed and lashes out at me. But she is improved since we met since arriving in brazil. She always has some ailment that bars her from activities. We just stay home. She is judgmental of others. Everyone is tacky to her or has complaint about people often complains about pal of different nationalities. We used to bike together. But the past few months has been excuses. Sometimes it feels like manipulation. I dont want to put her in only a negative light. We do have some thingsIn common, like doing exercise, biking, not wanting kids traveling. And our goals are aligned. However, we will start to have visa issues, and I have to marry her to remain in brazil or she return to usa. This ultimatum has me questioning everything, and im starting to think about how my life could be if I were single, working remotely going to europe, road tripping in usa, etc. And to make the situation a little more fun, I left my apartment in usa and would have to decide where to live.

Is the worst man. But my brazilian picks fights with me. So we stay home. We live minutes outside downtown seattle. We did nothing in a year. Absolutely nothing. She has nothing nice to say about anybody. This is funny, man, my brazilian woman, I have all of these complaints about her as well. Your perfectly describing her. I did all the cooking, cleaning and driving. Maybe once a month, she would do a bit of cleaning. She has depression. I always knew when it was hitting. It starts with the world. Her problems, then how shitty I am without fail.

Yeah, she seems like a headache. I would have an clear and amicable discussion about the break up. Don leave her in the dark or leave her heartbroken. Tell her how you feel. Remove all your stuff from her place and return home, do all those things you want too. Relocate somewhere you feel comfortable with and live according to your standards.

Title: Girlfriend is depressed after an abortion.
Thread
Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

Everyone has a choice to make. Personally, I do not think an abortion was the right one. There are many families out there that would have loved to adopt the baby. I do not think it is fair to kill a baby because you did not protect yourselves against pregnancy. Your girlfriend is right to feel the way she does. And I have a feeling you pressured her into doing something she really did not want to do. I hope she comes to her senses and leaves you anyone that would kill their own baby out of inconvenience is not a good person.

She told me she feels like she killed our baby because she did, but it is her choice, really and no one, but her has a right to tell her what to do with her body.

Babies do not always come on the right time. However, they are mostly a blessing. You are really ignorant to think the kid would not be happy to live. Cuz you do not have a degree. Do you know how many families out there have perfectly happy kids without having any degree? Did you guys both think it is going to be an undo as easy as it was making it sure she is cramping and stuff. She both of you did kill your baby, even if he was at a very initial phaseconfusion, she has lost a member of her family so sure she is grieving it. Most woman, subconsciously, do want babies, and the natural reaction is of joy when finding out. And then there is the logical brain that says stuff about money, career, age, etc. And they end up doing the only logical thing lie to themselves. It is not a good time, and they do not want it. And then, sure, the natural reaction is going to be sadness and depression. There are, for sure, woman who absolutely do not want kids, but it is not your of case. You are both young, so you both need to learn a bunch about yourselves. Take her to some therapy and go with her. Use god, damn contraception.

This is very sad and I hate that any couple has to go through this. I did not read of the comments, but I am asking a question why are not more young women on the pill? I am not judging at all just asking its easy and very effective. I took the pill for years and never even once got accidentally pregnant.

I met a brazilian woman years ago in the usa to make a long story short I worked remotely at her home in brazil then she lived with me in usa for months and now I here again in brazil she always been a difficult person but we worked through things and I extremely patient she praises me for my calmness and patience but it is wearing thin. Here are problems that I think of. She has problems sharing work at home. I often have to remind her to help. She is crazy of insecurities she often asks questions about women on my ig and I have a feeling that my life is under a microscope when I confront her about it, she says, im only asking questions im not accusing you of cheating. I feel gaslighted. Sometimes I think she talks to other guys on ig and projects it on me like she is keeping backup guys and wrongfully assumes that I keep backup girls. She easily gets stressed and lashes out at me. But she is improved since we met since arriving in brazil. She always has some ailment that bars her from activities. We just stay home. She is judgmental of others. Everyone is tacky to her or has complaint about people often complains about pal of different nationalities. We used to bike together. But the past few months has been excuses. Sometimes it feels like manipulation. I dont want to put her in only a negative light. We do have some thingsIn common, like doing exercise, biking, not wanting kids traveling. And our goals are aligned. However, we will start to have visa issues, and I have to marry her to remain in brazil or she return to usa. This ultimatum has me questioning everything, and im starting to think about how my life could be if I were single, working remotely going to europe, road tripping in usa, etc. And to make the situation a little more fun, I left my apartment in usa and would have to decide where to live. I dont want to go back to my city. Tbe im stressed and want to hear advice.

Shes always been a difficult person. Dont marry someone so difficult. Start making plans to move back to the states and then end things. I mean, cool that you have some things in common, but I am sure you have things in common with pretty much everyone. And that is not a good enough reason to legally tie your lives together.

Maybe it is time to take a break and head back to the usa by yourself for a month or tell her it is to sort out your apt etc while you are by yourself evaluate is life less stressful? Are you happier etc if you decide to stay with her then the next step where will you be happier? You have been together nonstop it has not allowed you the opportunity to reflect.

Okay I think everyone is basically telling you to get out of the relationship I am going to present something slightly different people are people ie they are not perfect if she has some flaws more than likely you have some too as adults we have to work on ourselves even more to heal wounds that are carried in from childhood from our parents the cultural differences are also there where you may have been raised in one way and she in another what I would suggest you do is sit down with her and have an honest chat about it tell her you love her but your patience is growing thin that you do not want to turn this relationship into one of spite and then ask her to work on herself maybe seek a support group or counselling I know how she must feel because the past two years I have worn my bus patience down because of the exact same reason especially stalking his instagram and getting crazy every time he want out with colleagues but I only realised what I was doing to him when he sat me and actually told me he is going to have trouble continuing if things do not change and so I put myself into anger management classes sought counselling did something called a healing circle because I realised this jealousy was coming from a constant narration of my dads affairs with many women since I was years old so my insecurities around me and my worthlessnessBuilt up. What I am trying to get at is not everyone is perfect. You tend to show more of your insecurities when you act from a place of fear, your of may love you loads, but because she is in a similar situation, or it brings similar feelings to when she may have been hurt in the past, she really needs to work on them for herself, and you need to support her. That being said, it is a long journey. Everyone has their own stuff to work on. You may also have some issues you need to work on. After all, it takes two to tango. You also need to ask yourself if you genuinely see yourself with her in the long run, do this without the clouds of her insecurities, because those things can be worked onconfusion, just look at her how you met and the good times. If they are worth it, then support her to get herself help. If you have supported her and she still does not change or improve, then you can suggest taking a break or just breaking up. But at least that way, you know, you did your best for a woman whom you are wholeheartedly loved. Our generation is too easy to cancel stuff, relationships, jobs, feelings, homes, people forget that others are human beings with their own experiences, own monsters in their closets. Sometimes we need to cut each other, some slack and help each other, even if the person you are helping is aRomantic partnerconfusion. All of us have the propensity to give love to other. We rarely show the same love to ourselves. She may have lost sight of what is important to her, and you may just need to take some time to remind her hope im not too forward. Obviously. Plus, do what is best for you happy face or smiley. Just remember to consider everything from different perspectives.

Not sure how old she is, but she sounds like she needs more growing up to do and is immature. Its one thing to be patient but another to put up with just constant immature bullshit. Maybe give her more time is the sex good? Why do not you want to go back to your city

You have to lie in the bed you made for yourself. You knew from the beginning that she is a difficult person, so either go back home and leave her or put up with it. What you have is not enough, and you are not happy you ve tried long enough.

I am brazilian and I have dated women like that. My advice is bail. Things will not get better. You will find yourself getting deeper in the rabbit hole. There are a ton of reasonable women in brazil and around the world. No need to get stuck on this one.

So you are with someone who you are incompatible with, in hopes that they will magically change, and all the incompatibilities will vanish. Interesting plan, let see how it works out.

To clarify, you are a us citizen, correct? Look, going to be both. He ish and also tough love here for you points, and especially should be hard deal breakers already. And I question if she is with you for visa purposes or just your run of the mill. Crazy of type. Either way, its not really healthy for you. Job wise, start ramping up your resume and putting it out there. Look for jobs that will help you with relocation, if needed. Example, certain hotel jobs. If mid level management will even house you in the hotel up to months until you find a place or look into short term airbnb in a city of choice, you can even look up common living, where you, I think, will be paired in an apartment with others. Its like hostel living, but apartment style, I thinkconfusion, and you can find a city or state you are interested in moving in for work. Ill post the link below. Heck, you can even apply jobs for cruise ships or property management, where you live, where you work, kind of thing. These are your options, as far as work housing. If things are stressing you out, have one more talk with partner in which improvement for the long term must be met, that you cant be a caregiver to her. And if it continues. So then there may be no long term rel. Tbe. If you feel like she will dupe hurt you once you try to issue a makeIt or break it. Talk with her. Start planning a safe exit for yourself. Last thing you want if to be stranded in brazil. Bec your of went psycho and take all your passport papers and money. I read this somewhere, and it was an immigration nightmare for the of to return statessideconfusion. If it feels like manipulation, you need to be steps ahead of her and care more for yourself.

Fine line between being a doormat and being patient. Ha! Some women think they want a nice, effeminate man until they get one. Listen to your heart. Instead of trying to be a nice guy with your intellect.

The golden rule for evaluation of a relationship is that if over time it brings more bad things and unhappiness to you, then good things and happiness, then it is time to end it.

Title: Girlfriend is depressed after an abortion.
Thread
Were both broke college students and cannot afford taking care of a kid. I want children with her in the future but now is not the right time. The kid would not be happy and we would not be able to finish our degrees. So we both agreed that an abortion is the best option. She took the pills a few days ago and still has extreme cramps and feels really sick. But she is hurting much more mentally. She told me she feels like she killed our baby. All she thinks about is what our kid could have grown up to be and tbe. I wonder that too. I think we underestimated how hard it would be for her because we are both pro choice. I thought everything would go back to normal after a day or so but it is like she is actually grieving a family member. She does not even want to get out of bed. Have any guys here experienced this with their girlfriend wife or have any women here felt like this after an abortion? I do not know how to make her feel better and I hate seeing her like this. I cook her favourite food, listen to her vent, hold her and put on her favourite movies, but it does not seem to help. I am at a loss. Sorry for the long post, but I really need to talk to someone

Your relationship is not going to make it I can tell you by my own experience, if you dont want to loose her, you must be nice and bring hapinnes to her but the problem is that if you are not okay, tho this is going to end so bad.

Title: I confusion think my sister confusion is being controlled by her boyfriend confusion.
Thread
Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

This is kind of deep. I would not really be asking the reddit community about this matter. This is serious. You got to be up the asses of local ad and make sure they get shit done and be careful when pursuing him and her. He sounds like a dangerous person and could snap at any second. Hopefully everything is ok, please keep us updated as to your sister welfare.

Title: I confusion do not want anything to do with my dad anymore
Thread
So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in. Mins was supposed to have an hour. At that pointconfusion, yells at me to make my bed just as good as his wife had it. Before I arrived repeatedly yells hes leaving right now. While im in sweaty, smelly, workout clothes with no time to shower before a two hour, drive calls me. I tech repeatedly and calls me stupid, tells meI remind him of everything he hates about my mom puts down my grandpanrets who have passed away on the other side of the family told me I need therapy told me he knows all about why my ex husband left me told me the reason I will not go to therapy with him is because im scared I will find out the truth that it is all my fault kicks me out of the vehicle in february in canada with my suitcase while calling me bitch tells me not to attend his funeral amp do I need to stay in contact with this man I can not be a good partner to my boyfriend or a good teacher to my students when I am being abused and wrapped up in anxiety with this insane so

Anyways fast forward to today she and her friends guy friend includedconfusion were going somewhere hours away to hangout and she found out that the guy friend was the one who added me he decided to snap me a video of him with her and called me a bitch and said he was going to steal her from me. I do not take shit like that. So I called him out and it upset him and he said he was going to come to my work and beat the shit outta me. I asked the girl why he is talking to me like that? And she said she has no control over him. She was laughing along with him talking bad about me in the videos, and it kind of upset me. I have had her left on, opened for an hour now and I have no idea what to do. I thought I really liked her. But now I am starting to think, maybe she is not a good person. I unaided.

Stop talking to the girl shes not worth it if she finds it funny, you can get hurt. Also shows how she loves drama and attention if she is laughing about it instead of telling the guy to back off, not worth it at all. And overall, she seems like a bad person do not bother with her.

Leading you on, probably gave him your snapchat to add, I would just delete her off everything and move.

Wouldn worry. Mate show offs are often cowards. Had an ex girlfriend do something similar once no contact for months. Then one day I am in the gym, and I start getting calls from a private number threatening me. Ifs new boyfriend told him, I do not deal with cowards who call off private nuts and hung up. He called me about times in the next hour, so I got pissed off, called a mutual of my ex, and mine asked, did he know new of? And his address gave me the details. Next time the prick called me, I quoted his address to him, gave him mine and said, if you are not at my house by I will be at yours by the next call. I got went straight to my voicemail, and it was, oh sorry, I just realized I have been calling the wrong person I might to call diff first name, same last name. So basically ignore these twats. They brag because they are insecure.

If she is causing you this many problems now, so early into your relationship and at your age, then imagine what she would be like a few years down the line, when serious adult shit comes up with money and rent and family, etc. Sounds like you have dodged a bullet. Op you need to find someone who supports you and cares about you, rather than someone playing silly games. As for the friend, he sounds like a perfect example of an oxygen thief. Leave him to it, and hopefully they have a wonderfully toxic relationship together. Agree with other posters on here, though, that you should report him to your employer, the police, etc. His threats are most probably empty ones, but sometimes it is still worth protecting yourself just in case

I am sure she is loving the attention two guys fighting over her. What fun let him have her and see how quickly she loses interest.

Similar thing happened to me. Just block the bitch and move on with your life as for the guy friend, he will not do anything so I would not worry about him. This reminds me of when I was seeing this girl and her big brother for whatever reason, got really jealous and wanted to fight me so I gave him my address and what do ya know he did not show happy face or smiley.

Women are not items to be stolen from you, because you do not own them. You probably know this already. That means for the guy to steal her. She has to cooperate with him, short of sa type scenarios, which is not what we are talking about. If he gets her. That means she went with him, and it would be weird to view it as though she were totally innocent. And he was the big, bad guy who came and stole your totally innocent little fairy princess or whatever. No, she went with him and double crossed you, and if it was because she was weak to his charisma, whatever, then she is weak, but it is still on her as much as it is on him. The ultimate lesson is that this sort of guy is not worth dealing with. For most modern women know, they are empowered by our modern legal structure. And that means that the days where men compete for female trophies are largely ending. Now that a good thing and it means this mindset is dying. And ultimately, guys who view women as things that can be stolen are on their way out.

Listen to me. Op I may not be in the same situation, but I have been dealing with a girl like this for whole years. We hooked up then just chaos, utter fucking chaos. My life was turned upside down, made a lot of stupid decisions based on her wacky mindset at the time had to go through a ton of therapy only to realize she was the problem. Not me. It just not worth it. Cut her off immediately and never look back.

Beat him up then when he is unconscious, drag him underneath a flag pole, then tie his shoes together and throw them across the pole so they are dangling above him. The first thing he will see is his shoes feet in the air also dump her.

A lot of girls your age and into their are only in it for the attention. You definitely want to avoid them at all costs. They really fuck with you. It can be hard, because sometimes you will not realize until you get pretty close to them. Good luck.

Hes not going to show up at your work call the guy a bitch and dare him to show up on the off chance he does show film the whole interaction never act aggressive if he touches you press criminal charges if he does injure you in any way make sure to play up the severity of the injury this will insure his charges are more severe and you can also get more money when you sue him hes a piece of shit and the type of person who deserves to have their life ruined as for the girl stop talking to her she seems like a truly bad person

Sounds like a bad case of narcissism on her end. If I were you, I would just block both of them on social media and move on with my life if there is a chance, I would have to deal with them in person. I would have to ignore and avoid them as much as possible. Besides, she showed you her true colors. When you mentioned, she was laughing along with him talking crap about you. Besides, if you tried to fight him, both of you would lose either way, because it is exactly what she wants.

This is how most guy friends are. This dude just said the quiet part out loud. Theres typically some form, mutual or underlying feelings and care behind it. Tread carefully. I got in a lot of trouble as a teen in one of these guy friend situations similar to this dont do anything to harm your future by trying to prove a point. Ask me how I know lol.

Yeah, this is the sort of high school drama stuff that I would fall for as well, and I totally would have been in ops shoes. Just make a quick break and stop talking to her. There will be another girl that comes around. Also do not talk for a year. Just ask the next one out and move on if she says,

Rear view mirror time here. Op she is playing. Both of you do not need this in your life. No conversation, no explanation, ghost block no, and move on. Do not check. So and definitely do not look back. Your life is going to be so much simpler. Good luck.

This girl has given you a gift the gift of knowing exactly who she is and who she surrounds herself with. Send him a message saying he can have her. Then send her a message saying, you are done, then block the whole lot of them.

Girl sounds like a waste of time. If you are friends for a year and she is letting this shit happen. You are not friends. If she is going out with another guy and letting him clown on you, then she is not worth being friends or anything else with.

I am senior in high schoolconfusion and I have been talking to a girl for just over a year recently we have been getting close and yesterday I noticed one of her guy friends that I do not know added me on snapchat. I asked her why one of her friends added me and she wanted to know who it was but I told her it is whatever. Anyways fast forward to today she and her friends guy friend includedconfusion were going somewhere hours away to hangout and she found out that the guy friend was the one who added me he decided to snap me a video of him with her and called me a bitch and said he was going to steal her from me. I do not take shit like that. So I called him out and it upset him and he said he was going to come to my work and beat the shit outta me. I asked the girl why he is talking to me like that? And she said she has no control over him. She was laughing along with him talking bad about me in the videos, and it kind of upset me. I have had her left on, opened for an hour now and I have no idea what to do. I thought I really liked her. But now I am starting to think, maybe she is not a good person. I unaided.

People who treat their close friends like that are toxic and not worth giving the time of day to just cut all contact.

That disrespectful in so many areas, but I would tell her to keep her toxic self off. You are phone. She still young and clearly does not care about how you feel. And I do not remember doing that when I was to my boyfriend, everyone is differentconfusion. What I am trying to get at is that is someone that will talk about you behind you are back, and that is not a table you want to sit at

You are not of. So what she does is really separate of your feelings. If she treats you poorly, then you should stop considering her as a friend. Obviously the dude was jealous of you. And this girl laughed at your expense. High school politics suck. Adulthood is much better. Once you control your destiny, neither are worth another thought from you. As for the fight, just tell him any girl that likes him is not worth your time. He can have her. As for her. You can tell her the videos hurt your feelings, and please do not speak to you anymore.

She is a drama queen who is gets off humiliating you in front of him. Best way to deal with this tell her, have no time for her games, then ghost her and him as you find a of that respects you.

She seems like more hassle than she is worth. If she is that easy to take, then let him have her. I agree. She cannot control him, but she cannot definitely control herself. Laughing and not standing up for you is enough to end it. I would say, if you read this reddit post and the genders were reversed, people would be going apeshit. I hope everything works out for you dude.

Forget about that girl. She is not worth it. I had the same thing happen when I was younger two dudes showed up to my house expecting a fight over a girl who had broken up with me then proceeded to pretend she was pregnant for months with mineconfusion stirring up all kinds of shit at my school the two dudes showed up and one of them threw off his shirt like some shit was about to go down. I shook both their hands and had a conversation with them gave them no reason to strike if they wouldve they would have gotten their asses beat. I was bigger than the both of them, but my la roided dad was sitting at the front door waiting for one of them to come at me. I did not know that at the time, ha. But at the end of the day, it was not worth the fight over. The girl, just conduct yourself and contain your anger

Bro, if she was laughing with him when he was talking shit about you and you saw it. That would be an instant no from me dawg! Thats enough for me to realize she does not really like you as much as you like her, and she is not trustworthy. Anybody willing to revel in making fun of you is not a good friend, and a good relationship is also a good friendship.

Good that you found out about her now she not a good person when she does not stand up for you and ridicules you on video, walk away from her and ignore her bow. If the guy does come into your work and assaults, you do have the right to have him arrested and I would press charges against him.

I think they are both loss causes in terms of wanting reasoning and apologies, explanations. You have the girl that feeds off this type of behavior and a dude that is willing to be the one to give her a show, albeit a bad oneconfusion blocking both of them should be. The option. Hoping to get a real and sincere apology or explanation through text is wishful thinking, because I feel like discussing anything important such as this should be done in person. If she really wanted to make amends, she would and shouldconfusionditch, communicating it through a screen. Other than that, I would say to work on yourself a relationship. Now, sounds like it will not help you in the current state of your mental health and finding someone that you idealized to help, that will not do any good and can only put you in situations you never wanted to be in the first place. I am saying this from experience, but I understand we all come from different backgrounds. So this may not suit you. So to that, I wish you luck anyways, be safe, too.

I am senior in high schoolconfusion and I have been talking to a girl for just over a year recently we have been getting close and yesterday I noticed one of her guy friends that I do not know added me on snapchat. I asked her why one of her friends added me and she wanted to know who it was but I told her it is whatever. Anyways fast forward to today she and her friends guy friend includedconfusion were going somewhere hours away to hangout and she found out that the guy friend was the one who added me he decided to snap me a video of him with her and called me a bitch and said he was going to steal her from me. I do not take shit like that. So I called him out and it upset him and he said he was going to come to my work and beat the shit outta me. I asked the girl why he is talking to me like that? And she said she has no control over him. She was laughing along with him talking bad about me in the videos, and it kind of upset me. I have had her left on, opened for an hour now and I have no idea what to do. I thought I really liked her. But now I am starting to think, maybe she is not a good person. I unaided.

I remember when I was young and did not know the difference in a quality lady and not a quality one. Shes enjoying it. Hell, she sounds like the worst if you have to fight, I hope you know what your doing. Most people do not seem to understand how violent a real fight is, but there are not no rules kid, except try to walk away when it is over. But I need to scream this part from the rooftops that girls not worth fighting or you will end up fighting everyone. Shes obviously getting off, making you jealous. I would drop her like a bad habit tell her to hang with her neanderthal, and they deserve each other

The type of girl that comes back with apologies years later been together with one that was treating me the same way abusive and at the end of our relationship, one of her cool friends was going to beat the shit out of me because beating normal guys is a flex. To make a long story short, the guy still lives with his parents at an age of and drives his parents car to his low paid job everyday and has reached nothing in his life. The girl is stuck with abusive men and is crying for help to get out of the circle. Tried messaging me back with apologies of how I treated her well and how she was sorry. And if we could talk moral, get on with your life. Forget about her. Even if it hurts in a couple of months, you will be happy with that decision.

No girl that would not defend you behind your back is worth fighting for. She is doing you a favor showing you where her loyalties lie. I would cut your losses. I hope everything works out.

I just had the best night of my life I told my friend how I felt about him we were going to see the uncharted movie and I just stopped and told him he was surprised and told me he needs time to think then during the movie he kept getting closer like moving his arm closer and just being way more fidgety than usual. So I offered out my hand and he held it by the end of the movie he was leaning against me, arm wrapped around mine, holding my hand we did not talk about stuff after but when I dropped him off, we kissed not just once either. A fair bit of it too he texted me after to tell me he had a really good time so I feeling very hopeful. I am kind of thinking this high is going to last for the next few days. I am just so damn happy ink what my sexuality is for sure but I do not care at this point like, screw it does not matter thanks for encouraging me to tell him

First of all, tell your boss at work whats happening that someone is threatening to beat you up at work? That way, they can keep an eye out, maybe print out his picture and give it to your boss if he needs it. And second of all, remove her from your friend list and do not talk in private to her anymore. She loves the attention and that you two seemingly want to fight for her. That is not the behaviour of someone who is girlfriend or even friend material. If he contacts you again, or if she does anyting to provoke you or him again, just ask her, why the hell would he need to steal you from me? Do I look like I want to date you? He can have you for all I care. You re a lousy friend anyway,

Confusion of the time your friends are right and they see things you do not took me confusion a year relationship to recognize thatconfusion confusion you are young so you may not have the perspective you get after a lengthy relationship but you always have your partners back if someone is shit talking them she did not have yours that is all you need to know I am sure you would have told your friends to stop talking shit if they were doing that and you sure as hell, would not have laughed along with them

My ex did something like this. When our relationship was starting to fall apart, she said she needed to have friends. Then that night, this guy starts calling me and saying, my dicks in your girl, and both of them laughing, telling me to kill myself and stuff fast forward a year and they are broken up and I am successful. So she cries and acts like she had no part in any of it. I gave her a second chance and she started down the same path of bullshit, and I had to kick her out. But it was harder than it would have been if I never have her a chance, do not give her a chance. Tell the other guy, thank you for getting her away from you and make sure she knows how undesirable she is with a personality like hers.

Cut the losses before you really get involved me. I just got suckered into fathering a newborn and months into my perfect son life. She leaves me for her friend again. Do not be like me. Confusion

Bro, go find a girl that does not keep shitty company even if she was going along with his shitty behavior to maintain the friendship or be neutral. It speaks volumes about how well she sets boundaries of acceptable behavior I get at everyone is still learning. Teach her you repect yourself too much to allow her shitty friends and relationships to drag you down. And if broheim wants to still fight, you kick his ass with a stick.

Title: I confusion do not want anything to do with my dad anymore
Thread
So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in. Mins was supposed to have an hour. At that pointconfusion, yells at me to make my bed just as good as his wife had it. Before I arrived repeatedly yells hes leaving right now. While im in sweaty, smelly, workout clothes with no time to shower before a two hour, drive calls me. I tech repeatedly and calls me stupid, tells meI remind him of everything he hates about my mom puts down my grandpanrets who have passed away on the other side of the family told me I need therapy told me he knows all about why my ex husband left me told me the reason I will not go to therapy with him is because im scared I will find out the truth that it is all my fault kicks me out of the vehicle in february in canada with my suitcase while calling me bitch tells me not to attend his funeral amp do I need to stay in contact with this man I can not be a good partner to my boyfriend or a good teacher to my students when I am being abused and wrapped up in anxiety with this insane so

You do not deserve to be treated like this if you need permission, this is it cut him off no contact, block him and do not let relatives try to convince you to. I cut off my toxic parents years ago, and its the best thing I ve ever done. Estrangedadultchild might be of use to you.

If you are lucky, he is really going to steal her would be too much trouble for me to stick around her. Of course she cannot control him, but if she laughs about it and still is friends with him, that is all you need to know.

Just as a precaution, though, you might want to tell your work and your friends about the guys threat and give them a description of him, because he could still do something to try to impress her.

If you can handle the guy I would honestly tell you to stand up for yourself or if you do not want to do that, at least have a plan for if he does try some shit, think about what you would do if he does show up to your work or something. Be prepared to deal with these people if push comes to shove.

If she disrespects you like that around this guy and she is always chilling him, shes not your girl, and she does not have any intention to be nut up buttercup. You can kick his ass for disrespecting you if it comes down to it, but it really should not. It sounds like he has some jealousy that you talk to the girl. The girl is clearly not worth fighting over, losing your job over or getting arrested over focus on yourself, and a better girl will come along. Plus, I can guarantee if you date some girl from your high school when you are about to graduate, you will go your separate ways sooner or later. Youre young

I do not take shit like that. So I called him out and it upset him and he said he was going to come to my work and beat the shit outta me. I asked the girl why he is talking to me like that? And she said she has no control over him. She was laughing along with him talking bad about me in the videos, and it kind of upset me. I have had her left on, opened for an hour now and I have no idea what to do. I thought I really liked her. But now I am starting to think, maybe she is not a good person. I unaided.

Title: I confusion think my sister confusion is being controlled by her boyfriend confusion.
Thread
Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

Yep, she, him. This relationship is over. Break up with her and move on. She is behind this and is playing a game. Girls can be evil.

Look, bro, I say this as a type of big brother. Im almost confusion. You are a senior in high school, about to graduate, you have your whole life ahead of you. Bro, these little high school relationships do not matter you are probably on your way to college military. Im guessing you are from the usaconfusion and will have such a better time when you enter. If you are single, you are not worried about your girl back home meeting up with jody, which no offense, it seems like she might already be doingconfusion, and you will not have to answer to anyone. The other thing is, you are say you were to fight the dude you risk the possibility of catching a charge. A charge are not worth no girl that would not even stand up to her friend saying that shit in the beginning, because catching that charge can fuck your life up for years. Itl pop up on every background check, job, application, lease, application, college application, scholarships, and on the topic of scholarships, it can get any scholarships. You have to go to college pulled. That is why I say it are not worth it. Also, I have come to realize that anyone who sits over snapchat, making threats will never chest up if given the chance. Here is the story for proof I had a friend not really a friend, kind of just ran with the same group in high schoolconfusion who always tried to act like a tough guy.And really wasnt saw me chilling with this one girl he was interested in. He thought he really had a chance he might have, but waited way to long and completely blew itconfusion. Well, she posted a picture of me and her on snap, and he went off, started saying, shit, like, oh, imma beat his ass next time I see him and shit like, imma show her what a real man is. He wasnt. He is a big ole wuss all talk, no biteconfusion. So I ended up calling him through her phone, telling him where I was and said, you want to fight or you just talking shit like you always do. His response was, oh, I do not have a ride, but il get you he was at the time, no license, no job sponging off his sick grandmotherconfusion. Few weeks later, me and her are walking around our little town square and run into him, and he is acting all cool with me, so I ask about it, and he starts shutting down, stuttering, trying to take back what he said and just ends up saying, yeah, I was just playing around, bro, you understand, right? Then proceeded to ask if I could come over and help him fix his uncles truck. At that moment, I knew he was full of shit I knew long ago, it was just a reminderconfusion, but do not do what I did? I was a very angry person at the time, hated everything and wanted someoneTo give me a reason.

Men who beat each other over women are weak and cowardly. Violence should be a last resort. Tell this guy to pound sand and find another girl without so much baggage. Trust me, losing teeth and a fat lip are not worth the trouble. Bro.

Its better to just let her go. Shes willing to risk her relationship with you, thinking you will fight for her. Dont feed into that kind of behavior.

I would say it is also really important if you get involved with any woman, date her for a year without sex and then you can see who the person really is. If you are looking for a meaningful relationship, this is why there are so many failed marriages in america

Do what you want, of course, but it is very simple call. The police show him the text of the threats of violence and have him charged. Obviously, the girl loves the attention of two men fighting over her. She is probably already dating him. I would walk away from both of them. Another piece of advice is do not be angry when you have anger, you become what you hate.

This age group high school is fucking wack if people are going to act like that due to someone you are seeing speaking to, it is not worth the stress dude. Sack her off. Find someone else who does not have people chasing her, getting overly jealous of you speaking to them.

I just had the best night of my life I told my friend how I felt about him we were going to see the uncharted movie and I just stopped and told him he was surprised and told me he needs time to think then during the movie he kept getting closer like moving his arm closer and just being way more fidgety than usual. So I offered out my hand and he held it by the end of the movie he was leaning against me, arm wrapped around mine, holding my hand we did not talk about stuff after but when I dropped him off, we kissed not just once either. A fair bit of it too he texted me after to tell me he had a really good time so I feeling very hopeful. I am kind of thinking this high is going to last for the next few days. I am just so damn happy ink what my sexuality is for sure but I do not care at this point like, screw it does not matter thanks for encouraging me to tell him

We started dating about years ago, broke up last autumn and recently reconciled. I dumped him, and he was the one who reached out when we got back together. Were happy, but sometimes I get the feeling that he is waiting for things to fall apart again. He recently said something about how easy I found it to leave him, which is not true at all. It sucked. I cried for a month straight, and I never want to do that again. I just do not know how to prove it to him.

Confusion why did you break up confusion? Why did he decide to come back? Confusion? Why did you decide to come back unless you have had an honest conversation about these things with yourself individuallyconfusion, and with him as a coupleconfusion, I can imagine why things feel tense. To be clear having this conversation does not mean it will be sunshine and roses, but you need to have it. And if you cannot answer these questions honestly and clearly, you need to pump the breaks asap, you should not have to prove your love to anyone. It not love. In that case, should you make clear efforts to do things that he is expressed are priorities for him. Yes. But according to your post, he is never said anything like that vaguely saying, prove you love me, sets everyone up to fail because it is a commend. You cannot meet

Ask him, what will make him feel like you are committed or what makes him feel special? That is what I did. And yet he broke up with me so moral of the story. Men aint shit.

As someone who got dumped and then got back together with the ex I also tell him that he is not committed enough you can call it trauma and most likely is something your of has not moved on from its like my of does everything right and we are happy but there is still this little itch that he once left me and how easy it was to leave me and how heart broken I was and the fear of going through all of that gain scares the hell out of me I bet your of is happy with you but the whole break up situation left him with triggers a trigger can be a small little thing or situation and when it happens it resembles as when you break up with him and then he feels insecure so both of you need to figure out what these triggers are so you can work it out together

Title: I confusion think my sister confusion is being controlled by her boyfriend confusion.
Thread
Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

So that is a lot to unpack. Your sister is in an abusive relationship, and given the fact that you cannot get in touch with her, I would consider contacting the local police for a welfare check and explain the situation. I do not mean to be an alarmist, but I would also be concerned if I were you beyond that, you really can just be as supportive as possible to your sister in the capacity she needs, which may mean just loving her from a distance until she is ready to leave on her own. Domestic violence situations are complicated and scary. I say this not to discourage you from involvement, but because nothing that happens in this situation is your fault, and you can only do so much. I hope your sister is able to leave this man safely some day, and I think you are a really great sister for trying to look out for her

This is all really concerning. Your sister seems to be in a very vulnerable place. Your brother and mother died in a short span of time, and now she is dating your bothers best friend. How long has she known him? The sudden shift in communication is incredibly worrisome too. I would definitely tell the police to do a wellness check.

Title: My confusion, boyfriend, confusion, thinks I am not committed to him. How do I show him otherwise?
Thread
We started dating about years ago, broke up last autumn and recently reconciled. I dumped him, and he was the one who reached out when we got back together. Were happy, but sometimes I get the feeling that he is waiting for things to fall apart again. He recently said something about how easy I found it to leave him, which is not true at all. It sucked. I cried for a month straight, and I never want to do that again. I just do not know how to prove it to him.

Don prove anything to anyone. Be yourself every day. If you feel like staying with him, stay. If you feel like leaving again, just go, you re not anyone property, and you do not owe your life to propping up some insecure guy. False sense of reality. If he wants to be sure to keep you around, he should learn how to be giving caring, supportive buff, generous, sensitive, and all that don be a chump, just because he is a chump.

I know you are only so you have limited funds to find out about this guy past or other habits but it is likely he is abused before and he is left a paper trail. Google his name and add is, and it might call up any court cases, as in joe abuser is or try joe abuser is and your state name of course you would have to verify it is him and not some other poor schmo. It might turn up evidence about his history you can use to get your sister away from him

Why did you break up with him last autumn have the issues that led you to end your relationship the first time been addressed resolved just because you dumped him the first time does not abscond him of responsibility for the relationship failing so it should not be all on you to reassure him it will not happen again

I am in a similar situation. The only difference may be my boyfriend is way too good for me. That is just a fact he caught me acting shady, wanted to fix things, and I immaturely blamed him in this accepting reconciliation situation. If you want to stay with him, you have to focus on his emotional state for a while. No matter who was more wrong in my situation, we are actually doing better than we have for a long time here. How I pulled it off. I was upfront about why I acted the way I did. He did not believe my reasoning at first, because he wanted to believe that I was not completely irrational, but enough discussion. And he stopped telling me that he did not believe me, letting him believe that I acted due to reasons that only I contributed to may seem kinder in the moment. But letting him know that some of my perceptions of his actions needed to be worked on is more important to long term success. I identified issues that I have been putting off for a long time in order to demonstrate that I am serious about fixing things. I directly connected these issues to things that were important to him. There was no reason to watch him play baseball because my glasses were so out of prescription that I could not see a thing. I made my first optometry appointment in ten years to finally remedy it. Instead of talking about it after seeingThat I was actually doing things instead of just talking about them, he started suggesting other things. Obviously, most people will not have been walking around blind for years, but most people have things they are putting off when they know they shouldn. Just basically, it is time to stop talking and start showing you need to start focusing on his needs for a while if you want him to feel more secure. If you resent that fact that he does not trust you after you walked away, you need to decide if it was actually the right decision to come back. If you need to come to terms with resenting him for resenting you, are going to remain in a toxic spiral. I am not saying your boyfriend is completely innocent. I am just saying you got to divide and conquer. If you are to have a chance at getting back to a baseline of trust

For of the relationship, it has been heavy drinking around nights a week glasses of vodka, soda, large tallboy cans of hard seltzerconfusion. The amount of nights where she would get so sloppy or pass out I lost count of. She comes from a family of alcoholics. Her mom is an alcoholic uncle, brothers, etc. She lives with her mother, so I see first hand her mother drinking cracks open a can of beer immediately, when coming home will have beers every night, plus bloody maryconfusion. I attempted to break up with her a month ago and she convinced me to give her another chance, saying that she was not going to drink for a month, not even a week in, and she admitted to me she had a drink other than that slip up. She is been doing good this month. We went to a meetings together, although she said she did not really want to go and that I made her go. Last night we talked about the last month and how she feels.

I know deep in my heart that I will never be comfortable with her drinking given her past and family history, I know I do not feel comfortable moving in getting married, having kids, etc. I feel like I am constantly in a fear of her returning to her previous drinking habits. Her sister is having a wedding beginning of may. Rooms need to be booked and flight tickets arranged. And there is pressure growing to do this. Given the entire history of what has happened in our relationship, I am not really comfortable making that month out commitment to attend, given that you cannot get a refund, etc. I feel like she should have cleaned up and done this year ago when I first talked to her about it. Now it feels like it is too late. I am really torn on how to handle this. It so hard investing months of your energy in a relationship and it just unraveling like this.

As someone who know alcoholic when they say that they will not stop just moderate, it is a lie alcoholic cannot control themself with alcohol. She is delusional. Like most addict, don ruin years of your life trying to help her like I did

Op I feel really bad for your girlfriend I do but you need to run she is not ready to get help yet she will keep spiraling she is already telling you that is her priority its not her fault she is sick but that does not mean you need to be brought down with her, I promise this is only going to get worse for you she does not want to get better right now and you cannot make her want that for herself as someone who had a sickness, there is nothing you can do make her want to get better. Please read that ten more times. It can only be her that decides it is time to change. Mental health is not your fault, but it is your responsibility. Shes not ready to take responsibility and it is absolutely not your responsibility to take on. Please leave and cut all contact. Its what is best for you and honestly, what is best for her. She needs to face the consequences of her actions. Maybe the loss will be one more tally in the hurt column that will lead to her wanting recovery. Maybe she will continue to spiral either way. Please move on and be well in your life. You deserve good things and happiness just as much as anyone else go. Put your efforts into what will bring you that

Tldr girlfriend has had a really bad drinking problem. She made steps this last month to change. Big wedding is coming up and there is pressure to attend, but I do not feel confident in our relationship and do not think I can be comfortable with her drinking. I am torn on how to handle it. Month relationship. Long story short, her drinking has been a major issue throughout our entire relationship. For of the relationship, it has been heavy drinking around nights a week glasses of vodka, soda, large tallboy cans of hard seltzerconfusion. The amount of nights where she would get so sloppy or pass out I lost count of. She comes from a family of alcoholics. Her mom is an alcoholic uncle, brothers, etc. She lives with her mother, so I see first hand her mother drinking cracks open a can of beer immediately, when coming home will have beers every night, plus bloody maryconfusion. I attempted to break up with her a month ago and she convinced me to give her another chance, saying that she was not going to drink for a month, not even a week in, and she admitted to me she had a drink other than that slip up. She is been doing good this month. We went to a meetings together, although she said she did not really want to go and that I made her go. Last night we talked about the last month and how she feels. She claims she does not plan on stoppingDrinking just moderating. I know deep in my heart that I will never be comfortable with her drinking given her past and family history, I know I do not feel comfortable moving in getting married, having kids, etc. I feel like I am constantly in a fear of her returning to her previous drinking habits. Her sister is having a wedding beginning of may. Rooms need to be booked and flight tickets arranged. And there is pressure growing to do this. Given the entire history of what has happened in our relationship, I am not really comfortable making that month out commitment to attend, given that you cannot get a refund, etc. I feel like she should have cleaned up and done this year ago when I first talked to her about it. Now it feels like it is too late. I am really torn on how to handle this. It so hard investing months of your energy in a relationship and it just unraveling like this.

Tell her this wedding is an ultimate test of the continuation of this relationship. If she gets drunk and erratic after the wedding, you will pack up and leave, but if she shows class and decorum and knows her limit, then you will continue this relationship. Good luck with the wedding.

The first thing is, there is a difference between a heavy drinker and an alcoholic. Alcoholics have a dependency, whereas a heavy drinker doesnt. An alcoholic will come up with any excuse to drink. A heavy drinker can go weeks without a drink, but when they do have one, they will get drunk. The other big difference is that an alcoholic will destroy their life and the lives of their loved ones in order to get their fix. Heavy drinkers do not do that. Secondly, alcoholics do not get better until they do things, admit they have a problem and decide for themselves to get better. You cannot force an alcoholic to get better. You can take her to a meetings, but it is worthless until she decides to accept their help. I do not know if your girlfriend and her family are just heavy drinkers or if they are alcoholics. I have lived with an alcoholic and it was not any fun. She eventually got help, but it was long after I left her

As long as you are the one making her stop drinking or attend a meetings, you are the one doing the work and you are not the drunk she has told to that she has no intention of stopping so what more do you need? What exactly will it take for you for value yourself more than this nonsense

You set her up in an a situation but she comes back with a notion that she can cut down and does not need to stop. Then she says she does not want to attend the meetings. I would put money on it that the reason she does not want to go is that the other attendees have heard all these excuses and defences before and they know it is all rubbish. She does not want to stop. She wants to maintain the status quo. Shes not ready and nothing is going to make her ready. Whether you stay with her or not is your decision to make. But if it was me I would be getting out and I sure as hell, would not be travelling to a wedding where there is a whole family of heavy drinkers

I have been a heroin addict and I have tons of alcoholics in my family I dated one alcoholics are worse in some ways than hard drug addicts moderation does not work for most addicts I know there is a moderation movement that is the new and exciting thing in alcohol addiction management but it does not work for most people and is just an excuse to keep drinking while pretending you are in control confusion her being convinced that she can control her drinking to that extent when she could not even stop for a month when your relationship was at stake is very telling that alcohol is going to be a problem for the foreseeable future addicts do not stop using until they want to and the desire has to come from within she may have rejected a but you should look into al anon in order to get support. See all the ghosts of your future if you stick around for this train wreck

She has an alcohol addiction, she needs help, let her family know to watch out for her in the wedding. If you decide to go have a long chat with her to see where this relationship will go. If she is not willing to get help, then end the relationship and get her family involved with her alcohol addiction, she needs support. If you decided to stay, then support her and get help some help it an addiction you cannot just stop it just like that it. A gradual step will be hard on both of you.

Shes from bad stock. You would not want an animal from a poor, hereditary line of illnesses and issues, and you do not want a partner from one either.

Time to break up. She will never change.

Title: My confusion, boyfriend, confusion, thinks I am not committed to him. How do I show him otherwise?
Thread
We started dating about years ago, broke up last autumn and recently reconciled. I dumped him, and he was the one who reached out when we got back together. Were happy, but sometimes I get the feeling that he is waiting for things to fall apart again. He recently said something about how easy I found it to leave him, which is not true at all. It sucked. I cried for a month straight, and I never want to do that again. I just do not know how to prove it to him.

Cooperation and consistency build trust the more you tell him you love him and the more you two work together to solve problems in your lives the easier it becomes for him to believe that you are into him.

Title: My confusion, boyfriend, confusion, thinks I am not committed to him. How do I show him otherwise?
Thread
We started dating about years ago, broke up last autumn and recently reconciled. I dumped him, and he was the one who reached out when we got back together. Were happy, but sometimes I get the feeling that he is waiting for things to fall apart again. He recently said something about how easy I found it to leave him, which is not true at all. It sucked. I cried for a month straight, and I never want to do that again. I just do not know how to prove it to him.

Why did you dump him? Did you give him a list of issues that you did not like? And he spent the time away working on them and fixing them.

Honestly, the more you tell him hug him and keep it simple, stupid him, the more he will feel it. I felt the same insecurity around my ex. She never really said I loved you or gave me random bits of affection. And now after we broke up, I realised she did love me just did not feel that way when she did not show.

I recently have been giving this exact scenario some thinking since I would like to get back with an ex that dumped me, but been asking myself how I would be able to rid of the feeling of it being just a matter of time before. The same happens again, and it just being a massive waste of time when you got back together. Did you have a serious talk about what it means and how you are going to prevent the same from happening? Or did you just kind of started talking and ended up together again? First, I would say, is, talk to him about what you posted here, that this is a different relationship to you and that you feel that he is waiting for this to fall apart again and it is hindering things. I think it would definitely help that you discuss with him the exact reason, with detail, of why you left the first time around avoid being vague about it, even if you have to be crude and then go on to discuss how that has been fixed for you. And it is no longer an issue. Talk to him about the future you imagine with him and why that future makes sense. It is possible. And you can see it happen. These are things that would put my mind at ease. But of course everyone is different. Get this information from him. Get him to open up to you about what is worrying him and go from thereGood luck I hope it works out.

Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

I am going to be completely honest, but from reading this amd, the update, he might of kidnapped her or killed her in anger, alot of those people will act as their victims, giving little info as possible, but still acting like they are around, I would really press the police to look into things faster and more urgently. This is probably very serious. If she is okay, please convince her to leave for the love of everything. This could be life or death.

Since caleb was friends with your older brother, is there any other friends you might know that still keep in contact with caleb? Can you use them to get to him without him knowing its you guys behind it praying your sister is found safe alive. Im so sorry to hear this edit also keep annoying the police to do something. Why would he answer a knock on the door to the police just cause nobody answered the door doesnt mean nobody was home. You should do whatever yoh can to get a warrant so the police could come into the apt on their own and look for her without having to knock on the door

Age difference, the verbal abuse location, stalking, distancing her from family, etc. She needs to get out immediately.

Can you contact another friend of your late brother who would know caleb also or contact an ex of to see what type of person he is ex would be more truthfulconfusion or do some online digging into all his social media and see what kinds of things he shares posts to see if there is any red flags

I would post about your sister being missing everywhere, with all the details, including who she was last seen with. Make a missing persons poster and go nuts! Have his name on it. Blow it up everywhere. Have all your friends and family share it. Let it be known that the police are involved. Have a number where people can call if they know where one of them are. Ask other friends of your brother if they have seen him or can contact his family. Tell them there is abuse. Make a huge fuss over this and blow it up as much as possible. Do not let up. Call the police everyday. I hope she is ok.

But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much.

She will not be done with him til she is done with him, you cannot save her. All you can do is be supportive. Remind her when she comes to you after having issues with him, that she is a good person who deserves to be treated with love and respect, and that she can choose at any point to stop tolerating anything less from him and choose someone new who will treat her as she deserves. And that when, if she wants to do so that you will be there for her

Title: Update for confused about my self and what to do as I am into my friend a fembot. Spoilers think I got the guy
Thread
I just had the best night of my life I told my friend how I felt about him we were going to see the uncharted movie and I just stopped and told him he was surprised and told me he needs time to think then during the movie he kept getting closer like moving his arm closer and just being way more fidgety than usual. So I offered out my hand and he held it by the end of the movie he was leaning against me, arm wrapped around mine, holding my hand we did not talk about stuff after but when I dropped him off, we kissed not just once either. A fair bit of it too he texted me after to tell me he had a really good time so I feeling very hopeful. I am kind of thinking this high is going to last for the next few days. I am just so damn happy ink what my sexuality is for sure but I do not care at this point like, screw it does not matter thanks for encouraging me to tell him

What you have described of their relationship are classic red flags and outright commonplace behaviours of every abusive relationship I have ever read about or seen your sisters life is possibly in danger somebody needs to get her out of that relationship before it escalates any further

One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

This is not in response to the final edits, because whoa! Assuming she is okay, you cannot force her to leave, no matter how much she may need to. All you can do is continue to remind her that the way he treats her is not okay, that she does not deserve it, that no one should treat anyone that way and continue to be there for her if she needs you. Good luck with everything, I truly hope she is okay.

I would tell your sister that you are feeling lonely, and could she please stay with you for a while because youre going through some really bad relationship stuff, keep reaching out, keep hanging out, keep asking her to stay over. So she sees that she has a way out, make sure he has no access to you or where you live, though, when you guys have a long time to talk, like at night before you sleep, tell her youre concerned about her. And you have noticed some things with his behavior that worry. You try not to make it accusatory, though. Just ask questions. I noticed he screamed at you when your phone wasnt working. Are you okay with him being that way? Are you happy with him? Do you feel like he respects you and wouldnt hurt you

Caleb is the one texting you your dad needs to put the drink down and do something you are the only family he has left. This should not be something you go through alone.

Are you able to involve your parents with this? Caleb is going to have an easier time brushing off your concern, because youre only, and with this extent of control, he probably has your sister agreeing.

Tldr girlfriend has had a really bad drinking problem. She made steps this last month to change. Big wedding is coming up and there is pressure to attend, but I do not feel confident in our relationship and do not think I can be comfortable with her drinking. I am torn on how to handle it. Month relationship. Long story short, her drinking has been a major issue throughout our entire relationship. For of the relationship, it has been heavy drinking around nights a week glasses of vodka, soda, large tallboy cans of hard seltzerconfusion. The amount of nights where she would get so sloppy or pass out I lost count of. She comes from a family of alcoholics. Her mom is an alcoholic uncle, brothers, etc. She lives with her mother, so I see first hand her mother drinking cracks open a can of beer immediately, when coming home will have beers every night, plus bloody maryconfusion. I attempted to break up with her a month ago and she convinced me to give her another chance, saying that she was not going to drink for a month, not even a week in, and she admitted to me she had a drink other than that slip up. She is been doing good this month. We went to a meetings together, although she said she did not really want to go and that I made her go. Last night we talked about the last month and how she feels. She claims she does not plan on stoppingDrinking just moderating. I know deep in my heart that I will never be comfortable with her drinking given her past and family history, I know I do not feel comfortable moving in getting married, having kids, etc. I feel like I am constantly in a fear of her returning to her previous drinking habits. Her sister is having a wedding beginning of may. Rooms need to be booked and flight tickets arranged. And there is pressure growing to do this. Given the entire history of what has happened in our relationship, I am not really comfortable making that month out commitment to attend, given that you cannot get a refund, etc. I feel like she should have cleaned up and done this year ago when I first talked to her about it. Now it feels like it is too late. I am really torn on how to handle this. It so hard investing months of your energy in a relationship and it just unraveling like this. I am looking for advice and support

You should not look at lost time as a motivation to stay with someone that just leads to more lost time while also still being unhappy when you said your girlfriend has no intentions of stopping drinking and to just moderate is this special occasions only friday only etc regardless you sound unhappy in a relationship filled with anxiety I would get out of there man saying it sucks to leave after giving up about two years is not a good reason to give up more years either communicate direct expectations and a commitment if your expectation is zero drinking and hers is one day a week obviously that is not going to work have the adult conversation of what you both want in this relationship and dynamic if you come to an agreement that works for you both fantastic if you dont move on, meet someone that you are more compatible with drinking can absolutely be a piece of compatibility

Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

It takes an average of leaving an abuser times before it sticks. Leave your door and heartconfusion open to her. She will leave for good when she is ready. Unfortunately, things are going to get worse for her until then.

Sounds like he is definetly very toxic. If he is having a bad day or is stressed, he definitely should not be taking it out on your sister or on anyone, for that matter, glad that the polic are involved now. But it is horrible that they even have to be. I hope she is okay. Hes definitely very insecure in the relationship, and sounds like he has communication issues.

Well, dude, I think your dad should know that caleb is a bum, an opportunistic and hopeful, want to be who hides himself in the light of others, pretending who he is when he is not. I always believed that love does not cost a thing, and it is just being happy with the simple things.

Tldr girlfriend has had a really bad drinking problem. She made steps this last month to change. Big wedding is coming up and there is pressure to attend, but I do not feel confident in our relationship and do not think I can be comfortable with her drinking. I am torn on how to handle it. Month relationship. Long story short, her drinking has been a major issue throughout our entire relationship. For of the relationship, it has been heavy drinking around nights a week glasses of vodka, soda, large tallboy cans of hard seltzerconfusion. The amount of nights where she would get so sloppy or pass out I lost count of. She comes from a family of alcoholics.

I attempted to break up with her a month ago and she convinced me to give her another chance, saying that she was not going to drink for a month, not even a week in, and she admitted to me she had a drink other than that slip up. She is been doing good this month. We went to a meetings together, although she said she did not really want to go and that I made her go. Last night we talked about the last month and how she feels. She claims she does not plan on stoppingDrinking just moderating. I know deep in my heart that I will never be comfortable with her drinking given her past and family history, I know I do not feel comfortable moving in getting married, having kids, etc. I feel like I am constantly in a fear of her returning to her previous drinking habits. Her sister is having a wedding beginning of may. Rooms need to be booked and flight tickets arranged. And there is pressure growing to do this. Given the entire history of what has happened in our relationship, I am not really comfortable making that month out commitment to attend, given that you cannot get a refund, etc. I feel like she should have cleaned up and done this year ago when I first talked to her about it. Now it feels like it is too late. I am really torn on how to handle this. It so hard investing months of your energy in a relationship and it just unraveling like this.

You need to break up with her. I am sorry, but she will not change.

Title: I confusion think my sister confusion is being controlled by her boyfriend confusion.
Thread
Hi. So like the title says, I am, I have a sister who is dating a guy who is, I do not know exactly when they started dating. Be I lived with my aunt for high school, be I had a scholarship to a really good school in ny, but because of my dads job, my family had to move to it, but I stayed in ny, but it was always the plan after I graduated for me and my sister to move in together. So when I came back, she was dating caleb, fake nameconfusion, who was our older brothers best friend, our brother died when I was in hsconfusion, which was whatever I thought it was kind of weird. But ok, so we picked out an apartment and signed a lease and everything, and we were excited, because it is closer to her job and in a better area, and right now she lives with her friend, who is not really easy to live with. So right before we are supposed to move in like a week before, she all of a sudden says, she cant. Caleb does not think it is smart to move right now, she is closer to his apartment now, so she basically leaves me screwed over, because I either have to give up the lease or find someone else. Luckily, I had a friend who was looking for a place. So it worked out, but still, I was kind of upset at the fact that she literally blew upAll of our plans be. Caleb said, so then some more weird stuff happened, like caleb always needing to know her location, and even with her location on, hed still call her all the time. One time her app glitched, and he called her up, sure, ing at her, it was really bad. She said he just had a bad day and was stressed. But after that, she stopped hanging out with me that much. So last week, she came to my apartment, sobbing. Be she got into a fight with him and she said, he got really mad and scary and asked to stay over. I told her sure, and told her she could stay over as long as she wanted, etc. I told her I would treat her to a manicures and pedicure for the next day, and we said we were going to get our hair done next weekend, which was this weekendconfusion. But the next day, when I woke up, she had left, I texted her, and it was not until another two days that she texted me back so weirdconfusion. And she just said she was fine, and her and caleb had made up. I asked her if she still wanted to get a mani pedi and she said, no, and did not mention anything about the hair appointments. Now, she is basically not really answering me, giving me short one word answers. I think caleb is controlling her or reading her messages. I am worried about her. But whenever iStop by her place. Either nobody is home or her roommate says she is staying at caleb. And whenever I go to caleb, nobody is there. Edit I told my dad he is not helpful at all.

Op send another message asking about an arrangement to go out or something but make it something that never happened. If the reply comes back not querying your text, then you will know it is him and not her. I hope the cops are triangulating her cellphone

Bro, just leave you are not tied down to this woman. Theres no clause that permits you to deal with things you never signed up for. There is plenty women out there who you can enjoy and do not have to feel anxious about. I also feel like this is the start of a toxic relationship, as you truly do not see yourself with her in the future. So why waste time?

The key to figuring out your sexuality is to decide which people you are attracted to and then saying, fuck it! Who needs labels? Everyone is hot.

Tldr girlfriend has had a really bad drinking problem. She made steps this last month to change. Big wedding is coming up and there is pressure to attend, but I do not feel confident in our relationship and do not think I can be comfortable with her drinking. I am torn on how to handle it. Month relationship. Long story short, her drinking has been a major issue throughout our entire relationship. For of the relationship, it has been heavy drinking around nights a week glasses of vodka, soda, large tallboy cans of hard seltzerconfusion. The amount of nights where she would get so sloppy or pass out I lost count of. She comes from a family of alcoholics. Her mom is an alcoholic uncle, brothers, etc. She lives with her mother, so I see first hand her mother drinking cracks open a can of beer immediately, when coming home will have beers every night, plus bloody maryconfusion. I attempted to break up with her a month ago and she convinced me to give her another chance, saying that she was not going to drink for a month, not even a week in, and she admitted to me she had a drink other than that slip up. She is been doing good this month. We went to a meetings together, although she said she did not really want to go and that I made her go. Last night we talked about the last month and how she feels. She claims she does not plan on stoppingDrinking just moderating. I know deep in my heart that I will never be comfortable with her drinking given her past and family history, I know I do not feel comfortable moving in getting married, having kids, etc. I feel like I am constantly in a fear of her returning to her previous drinking habits. Her sister is having a wedding beginning of may. Rooms need to be booked and flight tickets arranged. And there is pressure growing to do this. Given the entire history of what has happened in our relationship, I am not really comfortable making that month out commitment to attend, given that you cannot get a refund, etc. I feel like she should have cleaned up and done this year ago when I first talked to her about it. Now it feels like it is too late. I am really torn on how to handle this. It so hard investing months of your energy in a relationship and it just unraveling like this. I am looking for advice and support

I am sorry you are going through this. It is hard. The difficulty is getting your so to understand they have a problem. Try explaining how the drinking has a direct impact on you or an indirect impact on you, like missing appointments, money, etc. A lot of alcoholics do not know they are alcoholic. It is denial. I cannot give you a magic answer. But if you think they can change and they show willing, there is no reason why things cannot be magical in the future. I am sorry you are going through this. I really hope you think carefully on your decision. Addicts find it hard trust, meconfusion promises are broken and a lot of changes have to be made there. No going easy because it just slip slowly back into old habits. Good luck.

I just had the best night of my life I told my friend how I felt about him we were going to see the uncharted movie and I just stopped and told him he was surprised and told me he needs time to think then during the movie he kept getting closer like moving his arm closer and just being way more fidgety than usual. So I offered out my hand and he held it by the end of the movie he was leaning against me, arm wrapped around mine, holding my hand we did not talk about stuff after but when I dropped him off, we kissed not just once either. A fair bit of it too he texted me after to tell me he had a really good time so I feeling very hopeful. I am kind of thinking this high is going to last for the next few days.

Title: I confusion do not want anything to do with my dad anymore
Thread
So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in. Mins was supposed to have an hour. At that pointconfusion, yells at me to make my bed just as good as his wife had it. Before I arrived repeatedly yells hes leaving right now. While im in sweaty, smelly, workout clothes with no time to shower before a two hour, drive calls me. I tech repeatedly and calls me stupid, tells meI remind him of everything he hates about my mom puts down my grandpanrets who have passed away on the other side of the family told me I need therapy told me he knows all about why my ex husband left me told me the reason I will not go to therapy with him is because im scared I will find out the truth that it is all my fault kicks me out of the vehicle in february in canada with my suitcase while calling me bitch tells me not to attend his funeral amp do I need to stay in contact with this man I can not be a good partner to my boyfriend or a good teacher to my students when I am being abused and wrapped up in anxiety with this insane so

Get out now, having a history does not mean you have a future or that you need to stay in a bad situation. You deserve better. Join alanon and attend alanon meetings for yourself hear from others who have alcoholics in their lives and how they are taking care of themselves. Take it from someone who married an alcoholic who promised he would change. They wont so you need to take care of yourself.

This hits home. I was a drunk I was drinking while my wife was pregnant, drinking after and drinking during the second pregnancy with twins, I promised times to stop I would stop for a week then go back the last time I promised I got home late from work she and my year old were asleepconfusion I got stinkin drunk my pregnant wife woke up to get a glass of water and caught me for the hundredth time. She began packing her bags after a long talk she stayed I felt like a total ass. I was selfish and uncaring. I still feel horrible to this day that it took her threatening to leave to get me to stop. The next day I called a counselor and got appointments set. I went to every appointment told my wife all about it and took responsibility for my actions. I have anxiety and ocd and drinking was my coping mechanism. Its not an excuse by any means, but it certainly was the major factor. I also saved every receipt if she wanted to check for booze purchases. I offered to buy a breathalyzer to test me any time she declinedconfusion. When I worked late, she would often come down, smell my breath and take a sip of my soda to make sure I was not pouring booze in it. I never once stopped her because I completely broke that trust. I am months sober now and feel amazing. My wife also has not checked on me forA few months as I slowly earned that trust back. But if she ever had a suspicion, I would let her check anything in a heartbeat. A was a major turn off for me, the organization does not seek out the root cause of your drinking. Its all the devil made you do it and you have no control over yourself. Bullcrap. I know this is not how every a operates, but it is how the one in my ultra religious area worksconfusion, a has a very low success rate. My counselor dove deep into the root cause ocd and anxietyconfusion, and I found new healthy coping mechanisms. I would highly suggest setting an ultimatum. Us alcoholics have no reason to quit if you keep giving us more chances and do nothing about it, you become an enabler, its harsh, but it is reality. She needs to go to a professional counselor or else you are gone and stick to it. Do not let her drop out after a couple weeks and accept her starting back up again. It will be painful, and she will need to put in a lot of work. If she wants to change. If she does not want to change or refuses to seek help, you have to let her go

As someone who was married to an alcoholicbreak up and do not look back youre not married you have no kids unless she is really serious and ready to go to rehab and give up alcohol for the rest of her life because that is what alcoholics have to do they can never touch the stuff again because it will lead to relapse quicklyconfusion do not stay she will tell you she will cut down spoiler alert she cantconfusion or stop for a while she can stop for a while just long enough to lull you back into a false sense of security and then the drinking will start again there is nothing you can do to make her quit she has to want to quit for herself or she will not be successful for sure her whole family is alcoholic my ex parents were both alcoholics I never knew about that until he got out of rehab and we did marriage counselingconfusion and his sister was a meth addict. We raised his nieces because both parents were druggies. Alcoholism is a progressive disease, it will get worse even if she decided to get clean. I would still leave her. It takes at least a good year of lots of meetings and therapy to see if it is going to hopefully stick. Its a very selfish process, as it should be, but I do not recommend it to anyone unless you are married or have kids involved to go through that once an addict always anAddict. Even if she got clean. There is always a chance for relapse. Its not worth the headache. Addicts are manipulative. She made you stayconfusion, and they lie and only care about their drug. Getting clean is not just about stopping the substance that is only a small part of it. Recovery is changing toxic behaviors and unhealthy coping skills. She grew up in a alcoholic and dysfunctional home, so has no normal coping skills, not her fault. But that does not mean you should stick around and see if she will change my ex quit many times once for a whole year, but he quit on his own, and he was a miserable depressed, bast red during that time because he did not have the coping skills to deal with daily life with his alcohol gone check out this if you need more convincing to leave her, you will see what your life will be like. Educate yourself about alcoholism, run, do not walk. Nothing good will come out of this if she decides to seek treatment, I would still break up so she can focus on recovery if she stayed clean for at least a good year with therapy, etc. You can always reconsider. Personally, I will never be with anyone who is an active addict or one in recovery. I have lived that hell once and never again will I take the chance of having to relive that

Tldr girlfriend has had a really bad drinking problem. She made steps this last month to change.

For of the relationship, it has been heavy drinking around nights a week glasses of vodka, soda, large tallboy cans of hard seltzerconfusion. The amount of nights where she would get so sloppy or pass out I lost count of. She comes from a family of alcoholics. Her mom is an alcoholic uncle, brothers, etc. She lives with her mother, so I see first hand her mother drinking cracks open a can of beer immediately, when coming home will have beers every night, plus bloody maryconfusion. I attempted to break up with her a month ago and she convinced me to give her another chance, saying that she was not going to drink for a month, not even a week in, and she admitted to me she had a drink other than that slip up. She is been doing good this month. We went to a meetings together, although she said she did not really want to go and that I made her go. Last night we talked about the last month and how she feels. She claims she does not plan on stoppingDrinking just moderating. I know deep in my heart that I will never be comfortable with her drinking given her past and family history, I know I do not feel comfortable moving in getting married, having kids, etc. I feel like I am constantly in a fear of her returning to her previous drinking habits. Her sister is having a wedding beginning of may. Rooms need to be booked and flight tickets arranged. And there is pressure growing to do this. Given the entire history of what has happened in our relationship, I am not really comfortable making that month out commitment to attend, given that you cannot get a refund, etc. I feel like she should have cleaned up and done this year ago when I first talked to her about it.

Its really hard being in a situation like this. Sadly, she is not going to improve until she recognizes she has a problem and wants to change for herself even if she agrees to moderate or not drink for a month for you, it is likely the behavior will just repeat itself. If she is not addressing it directly without the commitment of marriage, I would end the relationship before getting even more invested personally.

Nope.

Months is not long compared to a bad marriage and eventual divorce I would just tell her if she wants you in her life she needs to commit to remaining sober if she wants to drink that is her choice and your response will be to move on

She is not ready to change. Maybe you should go see how she acts, and that will convince you to break up with her.

This is tough your desire to be supportive when a loved one needs help is commendable at the same time you cannot force someone to quit drinking if they are not ready too she needs to be on board or it will not work as to her drinking itself some people are able to moderate drinking after developing that kind of a problem. They are an extreme minority. In my experience, there is a reason total abstention is the norm amongst alcoholics you need to draw a clear line and be firm I not going to continue a relationship with you if you continue to drink, you are justified in making that demand. She is justified in not wanting to take that deal. You are justified in leaving if she doesn but do not waiver and do not accept her excuses make a decision and own it

Our entire relationship has been defined by this massive, deeply ingrained addiction that is untenable for me long term. What should I do come on? Op you know the answer to this? She has always had a drinking problem since the day you met her. She is surrounded by it. Alcoholics are alcoholics for life, whether they are drinking or not. And she is in a familial situation that makes it nearly inevitable that she will relapse frequently. She told you she will not stop drinking if this is your line in the sand as it should be, the time to leave was long ago, ideally before you started a relationship with someone who has no interest in managing their addiction.

You need to end this relationship. She is not remotely ready to admit she even has a problem, let alone ready to quit drinking. Alcoholism runs in my family as well. So I am very familiar with this.

She convinced me to give her another chance saying that she was not going to drink for a month not even a week in and she admitted to me she had a drink mate I am not going to rip into her for an inability to deny her addiction it is awful to break but if you set a boundary and she just walks over it what is the point of having a boundary? Long story short she is not going to stop until she hits the bottom and realises she has to you are going to still be in a relationship with her when this happens and you are going to be hitting the bottom with her when she does just say you are not going and stop you re tied to a sinking ship don drown

Why are you still with her? She an alcoholic and is not interested in substantial changes to her behavior. You are quite understandably not comfortable with her alcoholism and do not trust her because you shouldn you cannot see a future with her due to the drinking, which makes sense. So why are you with her? You know what is going to happen if you stay, she going to keep drinking. You all ask her to stop. She will make and break promises you will not trust her. Nothing is going to change.

I am a year old guy, sober years, married years. I was this girl with the exact same type of family. People continually ask me how I got sober. And the one thing I say is that you have to want to do it yourself at any cost. I lost. Most of my friends and my family alienated me and my wife. It was so flippin hard. It starts with the person wanting out of drugs and alcohol. If she does not want out, then she has no chance to quit. And by the way, there is no moderating. That ship has sailed and may have never been possible. People say, cut and run fine. My wife could have cut and run too, but we worked through it. But then we knew the universe meant for us to be together. Weird but true

Title: I confusion do not want anything to do with my dad anymore
Thread
So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in. Mins was supposed to have an hour. At that pointconfusion, yells at me to make my bed just as good as his wife had it. Before I arrived repeatedly yells hes leaving right now. While im in sweaty, smelly, workout clothes with no time to shower before a two hour, drive calls me. I tech repeatedly and calls me stupid, tells meI remind him of everything he hates about my mom puts down my grandpanrets who have passed away on the other side of the family told me I need therapy told me he knows all about why my ex husband left me told me the reason I will not go to therapy with him is because im scared I will find out the truth that it is all my fault kicks me out of the vehicle in february in canada with my suitcase while calling me bitch tells me not to attend his funeral amp do I need to stay in contact with this man I can not be a good partner to my boyfriend or a good teacher to my students when I am being abused and wrapped up in anxiety with this insane so

What the reason he treats you like this or is verbally abusive? I am sure theres two sides to the story here. I wonder I have heard alot of what he does, but why, tho what reason do you give him? He offered to do therapy together and you refuse.

One day you may have your own father and everybody elseconfusion, right where you need them. They will be where they are because you put them there with your character and boundaries. That day will just come to you when you realize you are among too many people like datongue, sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry a short memory on how grateful we have to be for what we have each other. It is true that we have to distance ourselves from others who only harm and put down our self narrative gaslit to prevent our ability to defend and establish boundaries. Youl get it everyone will be in their place with you, and youl be direct about how you feel about them. Love onlyconfusion, and you would have long abandoned shade as a topic for anything to talk about. Good luck, maam,

So this is clearly one side of the story. What is the other side? Were you saying anything to him? Were these responses to mean things you did said or did to him if you did nothing? And all of this was sewn at you with no provocation then, of course, remove him from your life.

I just wonder our dads will die one day and will not. We be sorry for not forgiving them and making amends do not we want to be on good terms at least shouldnt our dads in our lives. Is it that acceptable to give up on the relationship despite them being awful? I suppose on some cases, it would be best to not have them as a part of your life if they abused you. But what about in this instance my boyfriend confusion his dad is putting their family through hell. He cheating on his wife and is suing his own daughter my bus sisterconfusion trying to take her house my of thinks that his dads girlfriend is the one pulling the strings. His dad is a retired pilot who is considerably wealthy. I have never met him. I do not tell my of what I think I rather stay out of it, but of course, I will listen to what he has to say. My of is mentally stable. Now he is really amazing. Despite all this, he has not spoken with the dad in years. My bus mom is usually bringing the situation about his father up and she plays the victim. She is the kind of person who will complain about something bothering her but will not get help for it. For example, she needs to get a simple eye surgery so that she can see well, and she will always complain about how she cannot see and she trips andFalls, but will not make an appointment to see a doctor. I am getting off topic. I wonder what you think about it. By the way, my bus family, his mom and sisters love me. They always show me that, and I am happy to be a part of the family.

Absolutely not. I know it is hard to walk away from a parent. I did not speak to my mother for years, and now, after years of tending to her weekly, I have not spoken to her for almost months. The abuse is ridiculous, and even though I do miss her, I walked away. Dont even say goodbye.

So last week I went home for my grandma dad momconfusion funeral. I was hoping to drive, but my dad offered to give me air miles to fly as flights were bucks for a one hour flight. I really did not want to accept this as my dad can be extremely emotionally abusive, and I frankly, do not want to be around him. I saw there was a snowstorm coming along the way of the drive, and I was stressed out to have to make days of sub plans. Teacher, hereconfusion, as it is. So I took the airmail, paid the taxes myself on the flight and flew to his city and stayed at his house one night before the funeral in the next town. His away next morning, he perceives my fine answer to his question how did you sleep as filled with attitude, which, honestly, it probably was because I just have a very hard time being around him from there. The following things happenetongue, sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. He closes the laptop shut that I was working out on, and tells me we are leaving town in. Mins was supposed to have an hour. At that pointconfusion, yells at me to make my bed just as good as his wife had it. Before I arrived repeatedly yells hes leaving right now. While im in sweaty, smelly, workout clothes with no time to shower before a two hour, drive calls me.

Update thank you everyone for your support and feedback to the people saying they would like to hear his side of the story. Well, I do not have that side, but I can say he told me the reason I am the way I am is because I get no respect from you my entire life. He has been verbally abusive but then will buy me something or spend money to which I will say a million. Thank you, and it is always used against me recently, he drove his to deliver a bar stool for my new house. He bought me to match my others. I practically begged him not to do this drive, and my mom was coming through his town three days later, I said I had made arrangements for her to pick it up and get it to me, and I dint want him driving hours in mins celsius weather. He did the drive anyway with the key to my house he stole. After I said, please do not take one of my spare keysconfusion. I thanked him, and recently was told what an ungrateful bitch I am because he gave me that stool. This is one example of a million. To add to that. He whipped me with a leather belt as a child kicked my dog in the stomach, kicked my hamster in its wheel. Called my mom a pig while he was cheating on her. So I would like to know his side of the story too.

He asked you not to attend his funeral start early and go no now of course you do not want to go to therapy with your sperm donor he is incredibly toxic. Why would you spend a single moment you did not have to with him for your mental health just cut him out of your life. Block him everywhere and get the peace you deserve.

Title: I confusion will never be comfortable with my of confusion drinking ever again given her history and family big wedding in her family coming up and pressure is building to make a commitment to attend but I am just not comfortable given the situation how to handle
Thread
Tldr girlfriend has had a really bad drinking problem. She made steps this last month to change. Big wedding is coming up and there is pressure to attend, but I do not feel confident in our relationship and do not think I can be comfortable with her drinking. I am torn on how to handle it. Month relationship. Long story short, her drinking has been a major issue throughout our entire relationship. For of the relationship, it has been heavy drinking around nights a week glasses of vodka, soda, large tallboy cans of hard seltzerconfusion. The amount of nights where she would get so sloppy or pass out I lost count of. She comes from a family of alcoholics. Her mom is an alcoholic uncle, brothers, etc. She lives with her mother, so I see first hand her mother drinking cracks open a can of beer immediately, when coming home will have beers every night, plus bloody maryconfusion. I attempted to break up with her a month ago and she convinced me to give her another chance, saying that she was not going to drink for a month, not even a week in, and she admitted to me she had a drink other than that slip up. She is been doing good this month. We went to a meetings together, although she said she did not really want to go and that I made her go. Last night we talked about the last month and how she feels. She claims she does not plan on stoppingDrinking just moderating. I know deep in my heart that I will never be comfortable with her drinking given her past and family history, I know I do not feel comfortable moving in getting married, having kids, etc. I feel like I am constantly in a fear of her returning to her previous drinking habits. Her sister is having a wedding beginning of may. Rooms need to be booked and flight tickets arranged. And there is pressure growing to do this. Given the entire history of what has happened in our relationship, I am not really comfortable making that month out commitment to attend, given that you cannot get a refund, etc. I feel like she should have cleaned up and done this year ago when I first talked to her about it. Now it feels like it is too late. I am really torn on how to handle this. It so hard investing months of your energy in a relationship and it just unraveling like this. I am looking for advice and support
