Title: I cannot speak properly a lot of the time.
Thread
I am not sure if this could be a sign of a mental disorder or a physical disorder that I have not known about. But basically, when I speak, I slur a ton, and my words are kind of jumbled, basically not in the right orderconfusion. Occasionally, I stutter a lot and have to repeat my words and eventually just give up, because I cannot talk. It kind of just goes up and down, like, sometimes I do stutter, then sometimes I don confusion. A lot of people cannot understand what I am saying and tell me to repeat myself. Anybody know what is going

I believe this can be a form of dyslexia, but I could be wrong.

Title: Do antidepressants actually work for anyone?
Thread
Just curious what other peoples experiences are. I have been on so many different antidepressants and other mood drugs, and none have ever actually made any sort of noticeable improvement. Honestly, at this point, I find it hard to believe that they actually are effective. So out of curiosity, has anyone experienced significant improvement from meds?

When it is the right one, definitely. And sometimes some work for awhile, but not forever. It still worth it to get out of the spinning vortex of despair. I sometimes think of medications as such. You know how water running a certain path continuously will wear an ever increasing rut in the ground or rock face until there is no place else the water will go, that the troubled thoughts and in time, our minds can only work these paths. Medications help reopen the possible pathways. The mind is free to look at things differently.

Its so sad that mental health medication is so cruel to the human body. Really, the millions spent on creating medicine for other ailments is so advanced. But sadly, mental health medication is so poor it causes low moods, sluggishness weight gain amp more.

Title: Lately, I feel like im dissolving into air, losing myself.
Thread
I have been depressed since I hit puberty, but it got worse with years and lately, more. So after starting work during that time, I had so much anxiety that I did not do anything after work. Coz! It made me exhausted. I could not even watch videos after a while. Coz! It was too mich effort to focus. So I just lay in bed staring at youtube and not getting anything from it. So I switched to tiktok since its short. After a few weeks working, I noticed a buzzing in the back of my head feeling like when you hit metal and you touch the metal with your band. So the vibration travels through you, and its kind of creeping on me, alongside with the feeing of disappearing into thin air or losing myself. And its scary what is this? Is this dissociation or depersonalization plus someone im scared

Title: Tips amp tricks for coping with anxiety, depression
Thread
Just some stuff I have learned along the way, consolidated into a morning routine. Get up at the same time everyday. It helps regulate your sleep wake cycles. Having good sleep, hygiene is important, too. Drink a large glass of water, and then stay hydrated throughout the day, eat a large breakfast protein and fat, no sugar. It all help regulate your blood sugar levels. Since you probably tend to stress yourself out, which can cause spikes, crashes in blood sugar, and dysregulate your metabolism. Drink a cup or two of coffee, but no more too much caffeine can exacerbate anxiety. A couple cups is most likely okay and can actually ease depression while cooking and eating breakfast and having my coffee. I have a light therapy lamp facing me. It helps activate cells in the retinas that communicate with the hypothalamus and keep some cycles better regulated it. A pretty inexpensive, easy trick to feel more awake and combat winter blues. I just click it on for an hour or so. In the morning journal, I typically do a page for challenging distortions and a page for gratitude and self positivity. I track my feelings throughout the day too and jot down notes to discuss with my doctor and or therapist. Breathe, make sure you are breathing with your diaphragm and exhaling longer than you are inhaling, like in for six and out for eight. The counting is a good distraction. Anyway, exercise, even just some push ups. Sit ups and stretches go a longWay those are some generally good lifestyle tips and such, but do not forget the two big hitters therapy and medication. I shamelessly and gladly take my medication everyday because it really helps. And I go to therapy weekly to talk stuff out and get some insights. Those are a powerful combination, and it would be smart to pursue them. And of course, there is stuff I do that just did not end up on the list, like taking supplements and getting out in nature or listening to music, hope any of this helps.

I do not think anything I have said here is ground breaking or exactly revelatory, but the more right you are aware of and do the less wrong you will feel. And it is wise for us to nurture strength of not only body and mind, but also spirit. Seriously. Consider praying, watching sermons, etc. You do not have to pick any particular religion, faith, denomination or whatever. But consider investigating a spiritual practice of interest to you.

Title: Confusion I fucked up my life.
Thread
I here I moved across the country to wyoming, from florida with my boyfriend, confusion, who I was not even with for a year yet stupid. I know I quit my job that I loved. I left the place I called home and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. Things are not going smoothly. Its the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues. Communication has gotten the worst it is ever been minor, but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me he would be better about lack of trust in him due to his lies baggage on his end, causing major strain between the two of us mother in law, exesconfusion. I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end, since I quit my well paying job in florida to come here. My credit cards have not gotten paid since november and my bank account is, he told me he was going to take care of me financially. He hasnt. I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in florida for years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings were not reliant upon some guy I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced bed bath apartment back in florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now I threw away everything I valued andLoved about my life for some guy that cannot even be honest with me on a consistent basis for a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me for a guy who just does not understand me, even though he likes to act like he does, I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid. And you want to know what the worst part is. I do not think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make a month now I am not only broke I am in severe debt now things will never be the same because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was. I guess I cannot even do that, right? I am quite literally good for nothing. I should have done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. I do not even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I cannot even be mad at him. I did it to myself.

Damn I have been there did the exact same thing about years ago just before covidconfusion quit my job, which I also lovedconfusion to move in with my then girlfriend quite far away from home the dynamic between us changed extremely. Within about a month she started to grow cold towards me we were fighting everyday and out of nowhere, she tells me she thinks shes bi and then promptly told me she does not love me anymore and that I should be gone by the next morning I moved back, got a new job started from scratch. But strangely enough, I felt so happy like this huge crushing weight was lifted from my shoulders. I could breathe again and feel safe and secure. It definitely was not easy, but hell, I am so glad it worked out the way it did. But anyway, long story short, you are, life is not over. You have not ruined. Your life, may seem that way nowconfusion, but believe me, you have got literally everything to gain from here on out, youve got this

Title: Need to take the next step.
Thread
I have been struggling for years with anxiety and depression I have begun to be open about my battles I have always been open with my partner of years as well as helping my best friend. While she helps me, it will be beneficial if I finally allow myself to seek professional help. I grew up with a physical disability as well and grew up very independent out of stubbornness I have not been able to separate my physical woes from my mental. I was hoping that someone who has been in my shoes could share how they got over the hump and finally let themselves get help

I realized how much I was hurting my wife by not addressing my mental health. She is bi polar so she was super empathetic and sympathetic to my depression and anxiety like she really got it. That did not mean I was not hurting her I would lash out I would shut down I could not help with tasks around the house I was isolated I leaned on her for everything and then finally I could not even work. I just looked up one day and realized everything she was doing to hold our family together while I was actively sabotaging her by not getting help, life is infinitely better now that I am taking medicine and seeing a therapist

Title: Mom is destroying our family.
Thread
My family is living our version of a nightmare because of my mother, who lives alone and refuses to care for herself or accept help. This leads to her refusing to eat or drink properly, take her required medication and causes her to pass out. This leads to me calling police and or paramedics to go into her apartment, where they more times than not find her passed out on the floor. Weeks ago, she entered the hospital and the er doctor told me she may not survive the next hours she did, she stayed a little more than two weeks, went home after refusing any kind of rehabilitation, psychological or physicalconfusion, and is again in crisis with her health and well being she is again refusing help. This has been going on for years, like a broken record, and no one has been able to help us since. My mother is mostly decisional if she says no, that is that my mother is a year old woman who suffered from extreme depression and anxiety. She lives on a fixed income of month and pays in rent. She has close to in bills stacked up at her home that she has not paid and little more than in her bank account. She been in the hospital countless times over the last five years for the same thing. In fact, the local paramedics literally told me we re not telling you not to call us for your mom any more, but at some point you guys needTo help her yourselves. My fiancee and I live out of state, where I freelance five jobs, and she runs two companies from home. We both work hours a day, including nights and weekends. Her mother is years old and lives minutes away, but of course, cannot drive to help her, and even if she could drive, she would not be able to provide meaningful help. We have no available extended family or friends to help. We do not know what to do and we are desperate. I am happy to answer questions here or privately. Any interest and assistance is welcomed. Thank you. Redditors folded hands, victory hand, red heart

Title: How serious case of you need to visit therapy daily?
Thread
Sorry if this the wrong place to ask my boyfriend of months told me that about years ago, his mental health crashed. It resulted him getting medicated for it. But also he was seeing a therapist every day for some time. Thats all he told me about it. And I have been hesitant to ask more details about it. Been waiting for him to open up more about it. I am just wondering if anyone here knows how serious the situation has to be that you need to visit a therapist every day.
Comments
Other people have stated that he could just have the money for it, which is a very likely explanation. Psychiatrists that you have to pay for privately are very expensive if he is being ordered made to see a therapist every day, that is a different story. I will not say it is a massive red flag, but it does generally indicate something is wrong and it is acute.

Honestly, it all depends on how much money you have. I could be strongly recommended to stay in a hospital for three months, but without money. Il be there for days. Someone else could be recommended for a hospital stay of, say, weeks, but their insurance is really good. So they are there for weeks, or maybe months, if it is a money grab. And that is a serious issue in psychiatric facilities. So speculating on his condition is not helpful. Asking him if he is open to discussing what is going on with him is it will help you take things to another level when it comes to trust in your relationship, and it will provide you with an opportunity to determine whether or not the relationship is a good fit for you. Here are some things my partner did before and during our relationship, he asked me to talk to him about my mental health. I made it clear I struggle to do this. So he was patient, but made it clear that these were conversations that needed to happen. He took the initiative when I didnt. He said, talk to me and waited for hours, sometimes understanding that I was not doing this on purpose. I just had trouble talking. He knew a lot about some of the traumatic things I would been through growing up because we were already best friends. So he did not enter into this without any idea of how depression and anxiety affect me. But it is differentThe closer and more involved attached you are to a person who is going through something like that. I cannot hide the sane shit from an intimate partner that I can from a best friend. He did research on my diagnoses, so I have depression and ptsd and think I might have do so. He is researched all of these and how to cope with a partner who struggles with these, how it impacts the lives of patients and their families and relationships. He did not do this and bring me a bunch of data. He did this and was just normal with me, referring to this kind of information on his own. When issues arose. He might explain that he tried this or that approach a few times and ask what he could do differently. It made me realize that he was trying to take care of me and us and himself, because my issues were a lot to manage, not just for me, but for people around me. It definitely changed my perspective. Realizing that he was spending time studying this sort of thing, he realized he could not just deal with my crises on a regular basis, and was honest with himself about that, and with me, and he gave me an ultimatum, I needed to get help for this relationship to become more serious. Now, it did become more serious, and we decided to build together, save money together, etc. Before I began to get help, three years passed with me strugglingTo get to a point where I was actually in any kind of treatment. And during this time, we made plans and set things up that, by definition, made our relationship more serious. It was just naturally like that. I do not think either of us forgot we just did not discuss it, because it had been discussed. I took him seriously and he stepped back to watch what I would do. He was not sure what I would do. He just let me find my way. And I did not take him for granted. We did not communicate about this much. But when we did, we both got a lot of clarity on one anothers feelings and approaches. I was taking the time I needed and he was allowing me to, and we were both existing in that uncertainty together me, because I did not know what kind of time limit was in his head and him, because those boundaries had blurred a bit without me having much visible success in seeking help over the course of several years, even though I was sincerely trying and strugglingconfusion to do so, the whole time I have to be frank with you ink, if I would be putting up with the above bullshit. If my hypothetical partner was like, bow, I have this mountain of issues and they can become severe, you have to be honest with yourself about what this person means to you and what you yourself can handle for my actual partner. There isA lot I would do for him like a lot, a lot. I would laugh at the notion of doing for someone else. Honesty with yourself is going to be key here, as will his honesty about his condition, his needs, and calls boundaries.

Frequency may simply be that he has the financial resources and need to have therapy every day. Maybe the therapy was more like life coaching. I want to share a story with you and it may help you do what you need to do in getting answers. I began dating a woman years ago, and I told her I had struggled with mental health in the past and still had persistent anxiety. At some point, my ex suggested I never told her about my illness, cut to three years later and my physical health declined, and with it, I fell into depression. My partner simply did not have the willpower and mindset to be in a relationship with me unless I stopped all my re personal therapy and started couples counseling. I may not have expressed the depth of my mental health. I did not feel safe. We broke up because of conflict in the relationship. I could never go back because I was not supported in my time of need and her demand of stopping all re could have been catastrophic. Love is conditional. People will say I love you no matter what, and then the person has some drug abuse or cheats, and the partner does not have to stick it out. The partner has every reason and right to leave an unhealthy relationship. Boundaries are so important, and I never learned that we need to make healthy boundaries for ourselves. There was a post on here yesterday where op was taking care ofTheir partner to their own detriment. The op did not have enough time to handle their own life, shared home responsibilities, and also be responsible for their partners functioning. You do not want to be that person. You also do not want to be in the dark. If your partner gets worse and need to be hospitalized. If I were you, I would have an honest conversation about his diagnosis. Re he is currently taking. Has he been hospitalized? And also important is showing care and asking what you can do. If anything to help him, you need to know the facts. You can then decide if he is mental health is more than you can handle, and there is nothing wrong if it is too much for you. Worse would be staying in the relationship if it is too much

I am constantly drifting off into thoughts, dreaming things, and then I cannot tell if those things happened or not. I cannot trust my own fucking memories. As an example for that yesterday, some weed I ordered arrived, and I have memories of putting it away in a bag, one where I had way more than I thought, and one where I had way less than I thought. If that makes sense, and I cannot tell which one is real, no matter how hard I try, this is seriously affecting my life at this point. And I do not know what to do for context. I have struggled with depression and social anxiety and some other problem previously and still do. I was in a mental hospital for months last year and take antidepressants, sertralin, mgconfusion. Can someone please help me

Title: Is it normal to think that you do not deserve to take part in some recreational activity because you are not doing well enough in work or studies or is it unhealthy thinking?
Thread
So today I was going to apply for this fitness course because it interested me and I felt it might be fun it was also very cheap cause it was aimed at university students. But then I started thinking that I do not deserve it because my thesis writing has not been progressing very well and that I should just focus on that. Instead of wasting my time on something fun, I really wanted to take the course but I was hesitating too long and it got filled up now I have no chance of participating. I feel kind of shit

It probably depends are you engaging in recreation at the expense of healthy life goals if not giving yourself time to relax and distress while still pursuing your goals is critical stress literally kills

Yep, I cannot walk my dog because I have an anxiety attack like every time without a chaperone. So I punish myself by not exercising or going outside like I enjoy, because I feel bad for her, amongst other things.

When I was a boy, certain people had sayings like, all work and no play makes jack a dull boy. And such the main reason such sayings have fallen into disuse is because it is oversimplifying. I have no idea what it is like to write a thesis, but I do know what it is like to write a fantasy and or science fiction novel. Typical length is anywhere from eighty to a hundred and twenty thousand words. With my ideas tending to need the latterconfusion, I have written two such novels in the space of five days, and I was thoroughly exhausted at the end of that run. The only reason I was able to do it is because I was mentally unstable at the time, and two inspirations made my brain turn into a rocket. Normally, I have to take a break every half hour, because I am just stressed about where to go with my idea. Writing the journey of a dwarvish king from his home city to a mountain plateau and explaining how the horse and wagon are able to move faster than normal through highly artificial means, can wear you down fast when you do not have a previous draft to build from. And I am writing fiction, I cannot begin to imagine what it must be like to write something that not only has to be factual but also defensible to a ruthless group of peers. As for what you missed, put that out of your mind, find something elseTo relieve the pressure. Watch a film made by someone you like the work of listen to a piece of music made by someone you like, the work of go for a walk around somewhere you like, and have a detailed look at the place. There are so many leisure activities one can do without any involvement from others in real life. Making your own fun is easy and rewarding.

Title: How serious case of you need to visit therapy daily?
Thread
Sorry if this the wrong place to ask my boyfriend of months told me that about years ago, his mental health crashed. It resulted him getting medicated for it. But also he was seeing a therapist every day for some time. Thats all he told me about it. And I have been hesitant to ask more details about it. Been waiting for him to open up more about it. I am just wondering if anyone here knows how serious the situation has to be that you need to visit a therapist every day.

Typically, appointments happen weekly or biweekly. If people need more support than that, they may be recommended for top partial hospitalization program, brief, acute inpatient or a residential program.

Title: Why my friend is such an idiotic person.
Thread
So my friend leat say, a friend, confusion decided to stop talking to me. Just cuz she felt like she is not the most important person in the world, and that I exchanged her for someone else. That is what my other friend that goes into the same class with her said, and I maybe kind of regret that I introduced them to each other. I feel like friend a is such a narcissistic bitch, since I do not think she really cares for others or like she cares. But it is as if it is mainly about her, like if she does not feel like you are paying enough attention to her. She thinks you are not friends with her or what many times she talked about one person that they are such bitch. But then she became friends with them, like, I feel like she is such a hypocrite. And I am even angrier that it is getting to me cuz like, I really cared for. But, like, fuck you, I guess I will not get down to your knees and ask you for your forgiveness. You poor little girl that has no friends, even tho she goes out to hang out almost every day with someone, but she just says they do not care enough for her. So, like, fuck them, I guess, like, I just feel like she did not appreciate me at all. And what I did for her. So do I want to become friends with her again? Well, first,She stopped talking to me not me and nope I feel like I do not want to be friends with someone who acts like this and like I have really great friends that I fucking appreciate even tho I called her narcissistic. I have to say that I put myself in a first place and I also said that to her one time cuz my opinion is that when you have yourself first then you can truly care for others at that time she said that she has me first, even before her family and herself but I did not feel it was that genuine. And I kind of expected that we may part ways and I guess the time came. So yea, it is sometimes just better to let it goo, I guess

Have not seen anyone else mention this, but sorry if it is a repeat. I also dealt deal with this as an urge and behavioral pattern, but deeply did not want attention for cutting. Or generally, I was very much trying to figure out how to normal personconfusion, and I was not coached into it. I had the urge myself, and yes, as others have mentioned, the removal of sharp objects did nothing to deter, would just figure out something else, like burning myself or scratching myself with my nails or even rug burning till bleeding. So if anything, the monitoring, shame, access combo only escalated thingsconfusion. What was and still is the catalyst for me is a need to ground myself in the present moment. Reality, timespace, when I was younger, unmedicated, undiagnosed, had no tools. Cutting helped me to regulate my moods and pull me back to the present from spiraling loop, thinking of just floating off. I have since learned in therapy that this is a maladaptive coping technique, and have been given a bunch of different options to help fulfill that same need, and that I really fucken wish I would learned earlierconfusion among them. And again, she, anyone should figure out what works for them. And with an appropriate specialist as necessaryconfusion are tapping meditation. Many styles, but I have benefited from short, breathing based or focused listening techniquesconfusion, exercise, rigorous physical activity, but not to a punishing pointconfusion. And within this for a combo, physical, mindful yoga or even justSimple, personally guided stretching cold water face plunge. And this last is a bit wierd, but if in the moment, no other method is working, trying to remember a past cutting session, rather than actuating a new one. But it is kind of like the life vest on a crashing plane in the ocean, like a good last resort, but not necessarily up to the task. By that pointconfusion, as another pointed out, you are not the therapist, but you are in a position of care. You cannot prescribe anything. But maybe making some of these options ambiently available would be helpful and could also help move the general family mood from anxiety, fear, shame and into something that can feel more accepting, but also reflecting the care you all have for each other. Though, that last suggested technique is definitely something to discuss with a therapist. Firstconfusion really hope you all find a good path forward. Always sad to hear anyone is going through this

Would she be willing to talk to a mental health professional psychologist and or psychiatrist when you find a good one, they can really dig in and find what the root of the problem is one thing you need to do for her is help her learn how to discern when the problem is them rather than her one of my favourite songs includes the poetry I wait forever for you figure out your problem with me is you I will bet you dollars to donuts there are people in her school life that this describes to a if I can offer a piece of advice that eighteen year old me used to deliver quite aggressively anything she enjoys other than self mutilation that isconfusion that sounds horrible and frightening to you but does not entail trips to the hospitalconfusion do not try to discourage it. As I speak, I have a flat file of a song called I am the prophet of fatality playing in my ears, and people outside of my family would try to physically take this music off me. I will say this much for the individual I call all sorts of disowning terrible things. He at least knew that art is art and behaving in a manner that might cause oneself problems has nothing to do with it. At most, it is an expression of the cause. Always look as deep as you can, because the dearth of people who do that is what causes so many difficulties like these. ItMight be hard for her to answer but always ask her things like whom is mistreating her and try to work out an appropriate solution? Of course.

He not sure I really want to share this story, because it makes me seem a bit like a whiney jerk, and it makes my father look like a complete ass limo. I used to cut myself too one day, I cut myself bad enough that I personally feel looking back, that stitches might have been warranted I had a shirt on, and it bled through the shirt, and my father saw it upon seeing it, he completely flipped and actually came at me in an attempt to attack. Being athletic, I was never actually assaulted, but I would think if I had not been quick to move, maybe I would have. After that, I am not sure that I really saw the cutting as worth it. I am not saying what he did was right or what you should consider doing, but it seemed like it had an impact. However, my relationship with my father, while never goodconfusion may never really recover. This happened nearly years ago, but that is to say, it addressed the cutting, but it certainly did not address the underlying issues, and I have moved on to be quite tired of life at a young age, and regularly wishing I had never been born in the first place even to this day.

One of the reasons why this is a difficult age is that children are often not prepared for study in middle school these two comments have advice from experts on getting good test scores and overcoming math freedom from self harm overcoming self injury with skills from debt and other treatments this book has been endorsed by marsha lineman who created debt the best treatment for borderline personality disorder which has serious self injury as a frequent symptom. If you go to the amazon ad you will see that readers greatly appreciate this book one said this book helped me tremendously there a wide variety of treatments very severe cases require months of intense therapy but many people do well with a treatment that is just a booklet and a few therapy sessions usually or the book says that whenever possible treatment outside a hospital is best because therapy that teaches skills for the real world is best taught in the real world. Good news treatments that only reduce self harm are considered successful the less you self harm the stronger you are and better able to deal with the problems that led to your self harm likewise, the better you are in dealing with the underlying problems, the more it reduces the self harm

I cut for the better part of, like, years. I stopped when I was abt im now. So I do not consider myself clean yet, since it is been less than a yearconfusion. Honestly, there is not much you could have said to me in those times to make me stop. I wanted to hear I do not like that. You are doing this, but I understand and support you. Please come to me when you feel like cutting, and we will get through the urge together, rather than taking all of my razors, when everything was taken from me. Knives, scissors, razors, my bedroom door and even pencilsconfusion, I felt trapped. I had no release for that energy. Im so glad you caught it so young I had been cutting for almost a year before my mom found out, and bu then I was addicted. It is best to trust your children if they fuck up. Rhat, trust that is on them. But if you just take everything and say, I will not allow this, you are only making it harder on them. Imoconfusion. Talk about it do not try to control it be you really cannot skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant

Advice is always difficult in this cases, because we just know your vision of the problem anyway. A few things to consider and remember, you are not her therapist and should try to not overstep in this situation. This does not mean that you should not do anything, but besides checking that there is support and her family is dealing with it. Trying to talk more about the subject would not help. Now, if you are an important figure for her, the rules may change, and that would require another post. Some teenagers cut themselves to call for attention among peers. I super brave and not afraid of anythingconfusion or to their parents. Look, my cuttings. There is something wrong with meconfusion. The strategy usually works, so they keep getting attention through self harming, or it does not, and they do it harder or find other ways to call for attention. In other cases, it is not an attention call, it is because they hate themselves, and they are super angry to themselves. They split their identity and put everything they dislike there and punish it as a way to teach or make justice for the mistakes they did like it was another person and not really hurting themselves. Understanding what situation fit best to her can help to deal with it better. The idea is to avoid saying inappropriate things, like questioning why she do it making her feel stupid for doing it or just talking with her about that and ignore others. Interesting partOf her developing personality. Other important advice would be to talk with your daughter about it, clarifying that there are better ways to deal with emotional pain and you would be very happy if she share with you this kind of feelings, assuming that you have a close relationship with your daughterconfusion if they are close it, probably that at some point she may want to try it so it is better to address the topic instead of avoiding it big hug for you.

I was just like her. At her age, I myself found high school rough as well. I found I didnt fit in or had my own clique. Soon, as I started talking to a therapist, I started feeling much better. Also, I was put in a group to help my self esteem. I hope this helps.

Hi. I just recently finished school for social work. I was also a cutter as a teen. Some of the reasons children, or anyone cut, is because of modeling. They may have met someone at school. They idolize, or think, is better than them. That does it. So they think, ok, I can do. This is actually part of the reason I started. I met a really popular girl who seemed to have it all together. Not at all. Even popular girls can have moms on drugs that beat themconfusion anyways. She taught me how to do it in the school bathroom. Also, attention is a big factor if they feel forgotten as a child and unnoticed. This is a great way to get seen and get the love and attention they need. Its a big reason. I also started my parents, were all about their issues. I tried to hide it, but I also, several times, wore shirts with cuts up to my shoulders to dinner, and no one noticed just supporting my idealization. No one gives a shit about me. Luckily, most likely, its a stress relief mechanism. It releases endorfins and is not usually actually a sign someone wants to die when you see it. The worst thing to do is freak out as difficult as that may sound that will just make your child pull back even more. The best thing is to find out what is going on that made your child start. This, of course, get them counseling. One onOne and family is probably a good idea this is probably difficult for the family and your child right now good luck with this I know its scary smiling face with open hands

She tells us that she uses cutting to release the build up of tension from stress from her school. This is very valid, and she is found cutting to address this issue. But there are literally countless other ways for people to deal with stress and tension. Some of it may be related to changing environments. Think if you have ever quit a toxic job and felt better immediatelyconfusion. The rest is related to coping with distress and challenging emotions and seeing if any of these new techniques can help and reinforce them. Some can literally be as simple as dunking your face in a bowl of ice water, doing something self soothing, etc. A good therapist can help her figure out what would work for her. Specifically, many people who cut often also feel some type of shame or guilt or negativity afterwards, along with the desired tension release. So figuring out some other coping options that reduce some most of the tension and does not produce guilt, shame can be really positively reinforcing. Good luck.

Title: My girlfriends daughter is cutting herself.
Thread
Will keep this short my girlfriends year old daughter has been caught hiding scissors knives in her room and over the past years has been increasingly adding small but increasingly not so smallconfusion cuts to her body she has had mental health anxiety for about ish years now is getting emotional support from a child psychologist psychiatrist has problems learning at school and finds high school really hard she tells us that she uses cutting to release the build up of tension from stress from her school and get life that never gets better I am really hoping to get some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation or even someone who has struggled with cutting themselves to help me understand a way out so that we can guide her in the right direction and offer her the help she needs. We ve hidden all knives and scissors in the house but this is just a temporary fix. This does not get to the root of the problem and solve anything we know she can get her hands on sharp items. If she feels like doing it again, any guidance would help so much. Thanks, guys

Title: I am worried I might be insane or might be a psycho sociopath.
Thread
I sometimes think about becoming a serial killer. I realized I thought about this sometimes a couple hours ago and have not been able to let it go. I am terrified of the fact that I think about this stuff, of the fact that it happened more then once and the fact that I only just realized how deranged it is to think about things like that. I do not know what to do. I want to get help, but at the same time, I am scared they will lock me away in a mental institution for the rest of my life. The thing is, I do not fantasize about murdering people. I do not think I want to kill people. I have never gotten any pleasure or satisfaction from the idea of hurting other people. Whenever I think about becoming a serial killer, it always been me thinking about, what would my gimmick be? What would my name be? Would I be remembered as a serial killer or not? I do not want to be like this. I just want to be normal. I want to live a normal life, and I do not want to hurt people. I just want to live a normal fucking life and not have to worry about being a fucking psychopath. I think I am going to kill myself it better. Then me being a possible threat to other people. I do not want to tell my parents about this. My mom and dad would be destroyed. I shouldJust kill myself. I cannot live like this. I just want to be a normal teenager and live life like everybody else, but I cannot do that when I think about sick and demented things like this. Please help me, please tell me I am just overreacting. And these thoughts are just a result from watching too many horror movies or reading too many horror stories online. Please tell me other people have these weird, random thoughts. Sometimes I am so lost. I just want to live a normal life like everyone else. I am a garbage human. Why the fuck would I ever think this was okay? Why did I only just now realize this was wrong? I am scared. What do I do? I just want to live a normal life

Yes, people have weird thoughts like this all the time sounds to me that you might have a whole lot of creative energy invested in the wrong spots. I would suggest seeking out a professional instead of asking reddit about it before you get internet diagnosed. Just objectively, someone had to sit down and write dexter or any other serial killer dramas and most people who watch these shows do exactly what you do if you feel the inability to dismiss the thoughts and focus on other things is the issue well that is why you need a licensed professional and not the internet to parse through it with you

It sounds more to me like intrusive thoughts psychopaths get their only emotions from things like killing that when they really feel from my understanding to me it sounds like these are fleeting thoughts you have and think on that then make you feel awful I do it and its part of my ocd and anxiety I will be driving and think him what if I run into that lake barrier or off that bridge? I mentioned it to my husband one day while driving us to dinner trying to see if he does it bad idea he definitely does not. I get them about other things that creep me out too. When I was younger they scared me now I realize a lot of us think things, and some people do not let them fester like people with intrusive thoughts do don stress, actually do tell your parents mention you would never do it, but you just have these thoughts and want to see a therapist about how they stress you out. Good luck with your mental health. You are really young. There is plenty of time left to live a perfectly normal life. If, for some reason, you did have a mental health diagnosis, you can still live a normal life I have and am happily married, have a house career and a dog just breathe. Its actually better to let the thought happen than to repress it

It sounds like you are having intrusive thoughts. I doubt you are a psychopath. If you are this stressed about it, an actual psychopath would be happy thinking about those things.

Title: My issues have lead to life long money problems do not know how to figure it out
Thread
Not gambling related or anything. But I get fired from every job, got shit canned from two last year. Bad part is, I had just closed on a house months later, fired, then kicked out of the reserves in the military, probably did not help. I had just been fired from my civilian job year before, was fired from a good job that would have lead to really good things. Now, I broke and have days til I have zero left. I have applied everywhere, send out applications, got one interview, but I not technical enough, apparently, am applying to companies who do not know my backstory. But my former employer, I found out, is telling companies more than just he was terminated, basically blackballing me. And I have proof. Anyways, I went from financially stable, making a year, just closed on a house to broke in credit card debt up to my ass. All in months life a bitch. Sometimes I know my is at the root of it all. I mostly just get fed up with peoples bullshit and refuse to keep my mouth shut. Any advice is appreciated

The best place to discuss this is with your prescribing provider. While side effects are not uncommon, everyone is different and tapering adjustments may need to be made if your provider is not aware they cannot help you.

Title: Mental health hospital stay aus.
Thread
Hi there. I am wanting to admit myself to a mental hospital and was wondering if I am allowed piercings. I have certain piercings and do not know if they are allowed and if I am allowed clear ones so they do not close up.
Comments
They will most likely try to work with you. The clear plastic ones are probably best and blunt ends if possible. The concern is not only that you will hurt yourself with them, but also that another patient could hurt you. If another patient is experience psychosis, and your piercings trigger them, they could lunge at you and try to rip them from your face, an unlikely scenario, but still a possible oneconfusion.

It really depends on the hospital, but if you tell them you cannot take them out, they will be more likely to let you keep them. It might be better to put plastic ones in prior to going. So you do not have anything sharp for them to argue about.

I would argue the opposite taking care of yourself and your mental health by doing things you enjoy, will liberate your mind to study better.

Don beat yourself up over it. There are so many classes you can join anytime. And I am sure there is another one that you will be able to attend and have fun at you. Making this a bigger deal than it truly is. And overthinking it is a symptom of your depression. Try looking at the bigger picture it just a class.

Title: Public speaking, ruining mental health.
Thread
I confusion started a new job about a year ago in an account management position. Ive previously worked in account management but did not have a ton of direct contact with our clients. At my new job, im on zoom calls a day with clients. I suffer from general anxiety disorder, social anxiety and ocd. It is exhausting for me to be speaking with clients, and I have to take beta blockers to even be calm enough for all of these calls. I thought id just get used to so many calls with clients. But after a year I havent. I can hardly focus on anything besides my calls until im done with zoom for the day, which makes it difficult to complete other tasks between calls. I do not want to use mental illness as a crutch, but at what point do I decide if this job just is not a good fit for me. I also do not like having to take medication in order to run a meeting, and I cannot imagine the stress il be under once we are having meetings in person again, what do you think? Should I consider moving

I have hit a brick wall. I cannot get out of bed, and I feel like I am failing at every part of being human. I never go out because I have only one friend who is my colleague. I am overwhelmed by every little thing that stresses me out, and they throw me into massive meltdowns. I have very high anxiety, and even though I have learned to just live with it, sometimes it is just exhaustingconfusion. I have been trying yoga and meditation, but they have just stopped working. I should probably try to see a therapist, but I am terrified of the process having to call a go and asking to get referred to a therapyconfusion. Literally the smallest things are incredibly difficult for me, and I am just tired of being such a snowflake. I do not know how to change. I am almost convinced I am probably on the autism spectrum, either that or it is cptsd. I had quite a traumatic childhoodconfusion mirroring asd traits, and things are just getting harder. Then again, I had anxiety, sensory and social issues way before I was traumatized, which is why I am thinking it could be autism. I am just venting. Now, sometimes I am convinced it is just trauma, and sometimes I am convinced it is both

Title: Accidentally triggered someone is misophonia and got yelled
Thread
Visited my relatives today after not seeing them for years. This was my first time hanging out with people since the pandemic started. I have been isolating myself due to depression as well. My of convinced me to visit family after they invited me. So it took a lot for me to actually go. I was still very anxious the whole time and ready to go home at any moment, despite actually being happy to see all of them. My cousin was there with his wife, nikkiconfusion, who I never met before today. She was really nice, and overall, I like her when it was dinner time she did not join us. Cuz apparently she cannot be around people when they are chewing and talking due to misophonia. She hung out in the living room as we ate. After dinner, we all sat in the living room. After some time, nikki asked me if I could please stop tapping my foot. I was surprised. Cuz I did not even notice I was doing it, and I apologized and stopped cuz. She looked annoyed. My cousin explained that it triggers her misophonia and to please not take it personally, the conversations continued, and I tried my best to be mindful of my foot tapping, but after some time, my mind drifted, and I guess I started tapping it again. This time I triggered nikki too much cuz. She blew up on me, started yelling at me to stop tapping my stupid foot. So fucking much cuz it.Is so fucking irritating, I know it is not her, and it is her misophonia. Speaking that what my family explained to meconfusion, but I really was not doing it on purpose. The entire time there, I was fighting chills, a heavy feeling in my chest and sweaty palms. I was very anxious. The foot tapping just happens. I did explain this to my family. She was not there to say, bye, cuz! She was upset with herself for blowing up on me and went to the room they are staying in to calm down. She seemed so irritated and angry with me, and even though she did apologize. Now, I am scared of interacting with her in case I accidentally trigger her again. I am a huge nonconfrontational person, and this was a nightmare. I know it was not about me, but it felt like it was. My family apologized to me a lot and said they understand both of our issues. It was awkward. I just wanted to get out of that situation. I felt weak. I do not think we can be around each other. According to my cousin, other things that trigger her are loud, breathing.

When my of wants to use the oven which terrifies meconfusion, I get very angry, but instead of taking it out on him, I lock myself in our room while he cooks, so I understand how certain sounds and stuff affect others negatively. I do not blame her at all. Just being yelled at felt really awful. It just sad. Cuz! I liked her. And now I feel like shit for accidentally triggering her being yelled at in front of everyone

This sounds like it has nothing to do with you and you should not feel bad at all. How were you to know all her triggers she should have moved or maybe her husband should have been a buffer if he knew she was in a situation where anyone could trigger his wife at any moment getting yelled at is really awful and scary. I am sure everyone in your family is not blaming you and understands what happened. You could call a trusted family member that was there to express your feelings. But know this was not your fault.

Title: Accidentally triggered someone is misophonia and got yelled
Thread
Visited my relatives today after not seeing them for years. This was my first time hanging out with people since the pandemic started. I have been isolating myself due to depression as well. My of convinced me to visit family after they invited me. So it took a lot for me to actually go. I was still very anxious the whole time and ready to go home at any moment, despite actually being happy to see all of them. My cousin was there with his wife, nikkiconfusion, who I never met before today. She was really nice, and overall, I like her when it was dinner time she did not join us. Cuz apparently she cannot be around people when they are chewing and talking due to misophonia. She hung out in the living room as we ate. After dinner, we all sat in the living room. After some time, nikki asked me if I could please stop tapping my foot. I was surprised. Cuz I did not even notice I was doing it, and I apologized and stopped cuz. She looked annoyed. My cousin explained that it triggers her misophonia and to please not take it personally, the conversations continued, and I tried my best to be mindful of my foot tapping, but after some time, my mind drifted, and I guess I started tapping it again.

Title: How to ground yourself during an anxiety panic attack.
Thread
Grounding is an effective way to calm anxiety during a panic attack in this process you identify objects around you to help your brain recognize where you are this creates a sense of comfort because you know where you are and you feel more in control of the situation.

You could also taste something but by the time you are done with the first four, your panic would have moved down many notches find here

Of course you talk with the prescribing doctor. It very important to calm down. This will make you feel better. And let you think clearly, a very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical behavior therapy, which helps people who have bad, recommends this breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out and breathe seconds in breath and seconds out, breath till you feel ok.

Title: I have been self destructive for over a full year and I do not understand why.
Thread
I have dropped out of college twice, lied to my parents, family and friends by not telling them and fell into such a deep depression. I do not have the energy to do anything besides sit on the couch all day and drink. I do not understand how I got to this point or why I choose to keep putting myself in these positions. My parents are great. I used to put so much effort into school, but by no one else fault, but my own. I chose to piss it all away. Nothing traumatic happened to me. I was never abused. I have no real reason to make the choices I did. And yet I did. I have been hiding in my own mind for so long. I do not even know if I can be truly honest with people anymore without putting on a facade or pretending I am better than how I am. I have completely shut off any romantic chances, because nobody deserves to have to put up or settle for me. I am a fucking mess for no reason, and I hate it. I do not have the capacity to harm myself, but I have been having intrusive thoughts for months

Did this start when you started drinking or are you just drinking to combat it I ask because I can relate in the sense that I was drinking to combat occasional anxiety then the more I drank the more depressed anxious I became definitely see a psychiatrist or go to the hospital I just did with insane panic attacksconfusion and be honest theyare way less judgmental and quick to jump to conclusions than you would think

Title: Can no longer get excited.
Thread
I used to get excited about things like upcoming games and other small things in my life, but the constant worry of things that bother me has left me unable to get excited anymore, such as elder ring. I should be excited and happy about it like I was only a few months ago. But now even when I try to get mentally clear, it comes back minutes later, I am mostly worried, as right now, being years old, turning in months, I am seeking a level apprenticeship in veterinary nursing, which is very competitive in achieving one. And this is after finishing college, which left me with a job I did not want to do after finishing with my grandparents permission, who pay the majority of the bills and food I was allowed to pursue something I was more passionate about, but I still feel guilty and anxious constantly. Even despite being encouraged to, I do not understand why I cannot let go of this stress

Although a russian invasion of ukraine would be very bad, it would not start it important to not worry about things over which we have no control. Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy, cbtconfusion than with medicine, and some are successful with self help. Based on cut, I can show you some cut self help. But first I want to say that recently, there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing. When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale, gently, seconds each when you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is. The most intelligent don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts, count your blessings, and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress,Reduction methods to therapy and medication don overlook stress management. It can help even with very bad anxiety. Video a lot of helpful information, including the part program of brown and gerbarg.

There will not be a world war. It not the anymore look up, mutually assured destruction. But this sounds like an actual medical issue. As someone who is not professional, but has anxiety myself. This is just like me before seeing a psychiatrist getting on medication helped me, as did learning mindfulness cliche as it sounds.

Title: Am I depressed?
Thread
I am confusion. Now, I get no enjoyment from the life I live, day to day. I feel so isolated and lonely, I have no motivation to live. I am doing my red year in uni, and it is hard to find the motivation to study everyday. When a year ago, I loved my course. I do not enjoy anything. I rarely watch movies, go out or exercise. If I am not in class. I am in my bed, just laying there. I do not know what is wrong with me. I feel like crying all the time. Even when I am with my friends. I do not even accept their invites to go out. And even when we are chilling together, I have to pretend to smile or laugh at their jokes, cause they whole time, I feel horrible inside. I cannot even keep a conversation going with anyone. But the thing is ink. Why I feel this way I live with my mother, stepdad and sister, and they all treat me well. I am not abused or anything. But a few a times a week, il find myself planning to kill myself. I just have not cause my mom raised me as a single parent, and I know it would break her if I did. I do not know what to do. My girlfriend broke up with me over this, and I am losing a lot of people I hold dear to my heart. It sucks cause I was not always like this up.Until I was like I was pretty confident, outgoing and worked out a lot, I did not have any social anxiety and got decent attention from women. Now I am keg heavier and hate my life. I talked to my cousin recently about this, and she basically told me that I am just young. A every young person these days thinks they are depressed. Now I am conflicted. Am I really depressed or just going through a phase? And how long will this phase last cause I cannot take it anymore?

You are describing depression. You do not need a reason to be depressed, you need to seek help from a medical professional. Depression can be easily treated, especially when it is caught early. Do not hesitate. Its not worth losing years of your life.

Title: My girlfriends daughter is cutting herself.
Thread
Will keep this short my girlfriends year old daughter has been caught hiding scissors knives in her room and over the past years has been increasingly adding small but increasingly not so smallconfusion cuts to her body she has had mental health anxiety for about ish years now is getting emotional support from a child psychologist psychiatrist has problems learning at school and finds high school really hard she tells us that she uses cutting to release the build up of tension from stress from her school and get life that never gets better I am really hoping to get some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation or even someone who has struggled with cutting themselves to help me understand a way out so that we can guide her in the right direction and offer her the help she needs. We ve hidden all knives and scissors in the house but this is just a temporary fix. This does not get to the root of the problem and solve anything we know she can get her hands on sharp items. If she feels like doing it again, any guidance would help so much. Thanks, guys

Hey, this might seem like a weird idea, but it works for me whenever I am depressed and cannot get myself to do what I know. I want to exercise art, reaching out to friends, etc. Confusion. I lay down on my bed and scoot to the edge and turn myself upside down. I do this for about seconds, and then stand up after that little bit of context change. I am usually able to change what I do next to what I want to do. The motivation is not always the issue for me. It is just the act of actually doing it, as opposed to just thinking about what I should be doing. Hope you try it, wishing you the best

So today I was going to apply for this fitness course because it interested me and I felt it might be fun it was also very cheap cause it was aimed at university students. But then I started thinking that I do not deserve it because my thesis writing has not been progressing very well and that I should just focus on that. Instead of wasting my time on something fun, I really wanted to take the course but I was hesitating too long and it got filled up now I have no chance of participating. I feel kind of shit

I have found that punishing yourself for things like that compounds the problem example I have a problem with oversleeping I overslept for school by a wide margin because I overslept I punished myself by not eating. My relationship with food is not the bestconfusion then I was more tired because I did not get enough nutrients, slept for hours and felt awful so all of the negative feelings just mixed together not a good time. I could not focus on school. My quality of sleep was awful. Just bad news. Taking the time out of your day to do a structured activity that is good for your body no less can actually help you focus on other tasks and have a more healthy view or yourself. At least that is my experience. Also important is do not beat yourself up over missing this opportunity. I hope you find something similar that you want to

Find work life balance now if you are already struggling with it school is your job right now if you are struggling to progress maybe it is due to higher than needed levels of stress a regimented routine activity that is also really good for your health is not a bad choice it be different if you were choosing to go get sloshed and write off the entire weekend you re not your designating this specific and scheduled time to do something for yourself that is fun and you can go study again after go find the extracurricular just designate your time appropriately

This is unhealthy thinking you do not have the right to take care of yourself, but you have the moral obligation to do. So you do not owe a goddamn thing to anyone. But if you have the desire to contribute to society, the best way is to evolve to the best version of yourself. Developing means taking the right actions at the right time. And if you have found such activities, you really need to do them. Having recreational time is not a bonus for softies, but very critical. Notice that you feel terrible. Now try the different path next time.

Gonna be honest I do not know why I see so many depressed and suicidal people on reddit and they are from the uk or somewhere in europe, even on the suicidewatch. I do not live there so I guess I cannot have a opinion on the life there and mental support.

Referring you to guided self help is a way of helping even something more intensive all they can do is give you the information you still have to do all the work if they are refering you to self help then they feel you are capable of doing the work on your own they refer someone to a program when they do not think they will do it on their own it does really suck that there is not enough care for people who fall in the middle we re kind of just left in limbo land putting us into the more intensive programs is not the answer either though, I have done groups with people who are worse than me and I still end up left behind because the skills are too basic you can try and push for more care but be prepared for long waits mention that you struggle with self motivation. So self help is not as effective honestly. I am in the same boat as you too sick to function properly, but not sick enough to warrant the help I need. I was actually finally referred to a case worker in never heard from them, though.

The other person gives you a good answer. A thing to consider is that with the pandemic therapists, are swamped with people who want help. Remember that depression affects how we see ourselves. You look through depression glasses which make everything look worse.

Here, an alternative way of looking at this guided self help is simply a less intensive tier of help. Things like therapy and medication are intensive. It seems to me at least to make sense to start with more minimal treatment and then add to it as needed. If stuff like self help does not cut it, then, of course, therapy and meds will likely be on the table.

Title: What was your panic attack like
Thread
I had a panic attack the other night. I have terrible insomnia due to my mind wandering to terrible thoughts. When I am trying to sleep, I literally have to wait till I have been up for so long that I cannot physically stay awake any longer could be anywhere from hours. Then I will have about days where I sleep. Okay and then the insomnia starts again. I have had maybe a handful of panic episodes in the past, but nothing compared to the one last night, I started to have really negative thoughts, so I got up and tried breathing exercises. My heart was racing, I started feeling really anxious, so I lay back down and just tried to focus on breathing. I started sobbing and was clenching and unclenching my hands rhythmically to try and sooth myself, but was also trying to be quiet so I would not wake my of. I could not keep quiet and started gasping for air and was almost hysterical. So she woke up and asked me what was wrong? I told her I thought I was having a panic attack, so she just held onto me and told me she was there, and I was okay. I literally laid there, unable to form a coherent thought, sobbing and gasping for air, I kind of blacked out or browned out. I do not remember much. I just remember being scared that I was losing my mind and worried. I could hurt myself. When I calmed down, I tookA xanax and slept the whole next day. But that panic attack was the worst thing I have ever experienced, and I would rather have a lobotomy then go through that again. The blacking out probably scared me the most anyone else experience this.

I will suggest a possible explanation for what happened. You said you practiced a breathing exercise and a bad breathing exercise can make it worse there a lot of misinformation about this I will show you two experts with advice for panic attack breathing. A therapist and a university researcher. Sometimes people get over panic attacks with nothing but self help. I will tell you about that. And also some treatments you probably never heard of I heard someone say that although slow breathing is good for moments of panic, the attacks keep coming back so it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system. Natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You should not get upset about them. You do not worry about fast heartbeat when you run and there is no reason to fear it with a panic attack source, when panic attacks by do david burns, you cannot go wrong with stress management. It something we all need. This could help you with your problem psychology today online says that do dave carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias, and the author of three self help books including panic attacks. Workbook in this video, do carbonell demonstrates a breathing exercise that he says is helpful for panic attacks. One of the best treatments is time you know the old saying familiarity breeds contempt. After a while the attacks are seen as aNuisance instead of a threat. I will tell you about two other things that you probably will not need. Its good to know they are there if you need them. A study by a researcher named meuret at southern methodist university showed that a biofeedback method called cart that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation, making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self help successfully. There. A treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms, for example, by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise.

There. Irony in this post lol feel what you want and do what you want. It might take a while to figure out but start listening to your thoughts and validate them yourself. You do not need to ask someone if your thoughts or feelings are right. I mean, you can, but not for everything or else you will end up feeling how you do now.

Since you have been dictated what to done for your long part of life it maybe for possible that you have avoided feelings because your know you have no control over your life it is an important feelings for human to be in control of life although in boundaries but yes I recommend you start with some self love practices like tasting new icecream try new things and address how you feel this will bring your feelings back to slowly secondly work on healthy boundaries identifies people managing people and an important one your own goals what are they how you plan to achieve them I would love to hear about your views on your goals no matter how tribal they may sound if you are comfortable do let me know about them I hope this helps

I feel a lot of self loathing right now, and the thoughts are just swirling in my head, preventing me from concentrating. I still have several more hours of work left, and I am fighting back the strong urge to cry. Anyone know how I can calm myself down?
Comments
The easiest way to calm down, to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale, gently, seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem. Instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain and you feel better. Also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts, count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes. A lot of things help with anxiety and depression, standard treatments, and the self help recommended by therapists. Please click on my name and read

I get depressed randomly, and whenever it happens, it is always right before a workout. What I usually do is be depressed because I will not be able to do my form reps and sets properly if I force myself to workout, which I do not recommend anyone else doconfusion, I am likely to get into an accident or die, so I would rather not risk it. Plus, it is just really dumb. If I fail, I start to become more depressed and pause workout sessions for a week or so and lose progress. I do not want to be unproductive, though, whenever I get depressed, if I am not going to workout, I read a book or listen to an audio, I take a walk or even write my feelings out

A therapist who has studied lifestyle and depression says that we have a natural aversion to gyms, he suggests enjoyable ways to get exercise, sports, swimming and long walks with family and friends. I can tell you some self help things, but I am not saying necessarily that these are all you need treating a serious case of depression with nothing but self help is risky. Taking things in baby steps very important. This is the key to motivation, and motivation is the key to recovery. Just min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you do not make yourself sick of exercise with too much. This is a motivation trick that is been used in behavior modification programs, since the if a task seems like it is too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy. Cleaning start by cleaning for, or min, and take a min break. Homework, start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter. You are going to read by looking at headings, sub headings, etc. You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun if you are not getting any enjoyment out of things. Here is something that people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as yourFavorite music or movie if there is just one movie you like watch it once or twice then find movies that are like it in some way with similar story or the same actor keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety if you are thinking about professional help treatment usually begins by seeing the go who can give you a referral? I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life affecting how you feel if you are depressed I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits.

Title: I rarely cry like really rarely, but when I do it is for a stupid reason or it is really not a big deal.
Thread
So basically I am a grown man. Im and I do know that I lives my whole life under a huge stress and from a really young age, let us say from age till now, but I know how to deal with it alone, cause I always did. But the last years have been pretty hard on my I went, threw my first love breakup, but still I moved on. And I do not think I have some mental health issues or do i? Thats why I am seeking answers in here. So please be generous if you have been threw this. I mean, sometimes it is hard and tiring to be strong all the time. Anyways, the first time I cried for a stupid reason was when I hit my dads car, and he was so cool with it, he did not even yell at me. So I cried for that cause. Jedi did not punish me or yell at me. And the second time was today at work. So like my boss kept telling that I pretty much fucked up my job this whole month and shit. But he was so cool with it. Our relationship is like brothers. He is like a brother to me, and I have never had a big brother. So like, he is my big bro and also my cousin. So he was talking and telling me how I did bad this month. And boom, I started tearing. He was like, yo, chill, I do not mean that. AndWe casually ignored what happened and shit and we cool anyways. Can someone help or guide me I really need answers red heart.

Even the most stable feeling and seeming people could use therapy once in awhile those are not entirely stupid reasons to cry and it is likely that you are crying in those moments because someone criticized you making you vulnerable but then still showed you unconditional support it can be quite the shift in emotion and shocking if you have never receive it before seek counseling my friend

Title: My girlfriends daughter is cutting herself.
Thread
Will keep this short my girlfriends year old daughter has been caught hiding scissors knives in her room and over the past years has been increasingly adding small but increasingly not so smallconfusion cuts to her body she has had mental health anxiety for about ish years now is getting emotional support from a child psychologist psychiatrist has problems learning at school and finds high school really hard she tells us that she uses cutting to release the build up of tension from stress from her school and get life that never gets better I am really hoping to get some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation or even someone who has struggled with cutting themselves to help me understand a way out so that we can guide her in the right direction and offer her the help she needs. We ve hidden all knives and scissors in the house but this is just a temporary fix. This does not get to the root of the problem and solve anything we know she can get her hands on sharp items. If she feels like doing it again, any guidance would help so much. Thanks, guys

Try another therapist, and not one who would try to push her into the school system. Are you sure? The therapist believes her problems. I used to go to doctors, etc. At years old, when I got my first depressionconfusion, and most of them said to stop pretending and suck it up. Still mad at them. Up to this day, I was in immense distress every day, and they did not believe me, probably because I could explain my problems and thoughts very clear. I never tried to hide my feelings. They found that weird. So in their eyes, it looked like I just did not want to go to school, be sure she is taken seriously. She might be only years old, but when it goes wrong now, she might get stuck with trauma for years

Title: A controversial question.
Thread
Hello, everyone. I have a controversial question, as stated aboveconfusion. Why do people commit suicide? I know there is a variety of reasons why peer pressure, societal pressure, family issues, abuse, neglect, bullying, etc. But are not all of those things issues that everyone eventually has to face. I was, according to a therapist that I do not believeconfusion physically and emotionally abused. Apparentlyconfusion by my parents during my childhood, and I was frequently bullied and harassed by students in elementary and middle school. I was usually bullied because of my height, shortconfusion, my haircut, my ethnicity im mexicanconfusion, etc. But I do not understand how anything like that could push someone to want to kill themselves. Life is tough. Nobody said it was going to be easy, and sometimes we have to steamroll through it. I let my bullies beat me down, and due to that, I suffered from depression, loneliness, and I never spoke up against anyone, something that stems from home since I was verbally beat down a lotconfusion, which led me to frequently becoming a punching bag for others. It has not been until recently in the grade that my friends have been helping me to speak up and not be afraid anymore, and I got those friends from talking. Plus, one of the most important human desires is the desire to live. So suicide is literally against human nature. So why do people contemplate or commit suicide if you were once suicidal or are suicidal? Its alright. Mateconfusion. Why do youOr did you think that suicide was the only way?

Its not rational. It does go against natural instincts. Its the ill part of a mental illness. For me, it would seem like the best solution to stop feeling empty a burden, things like that.

It feels like the only way to escape even though its not rational it literally does make no sense its just how it is when there is no escaping an emotion or situation. For some people, whenever I feel suicidal now I instead try to imagine all the things I could do instead of killing myself, which helps. I cant imagine trying to commit suicide again right now, even though I understood it in the past, its one of those things that is impossible to explain or understand on a deep levelconfusion unless you have felt it before.

Some people hate themselves so much that they cannot live with themselves. They do not see a future at all and do not believe they can ever be happy. Edit to add stuff.

Title: How do I talk about my mental state with others?

As a fairly closed off and private person, I have always found it difficult to discuss my feelings and mental state with even my close friends and family. That part of the reason I do not know if therapy would be the most effective for me at this time, I cannot open up well. So are there any good methods or tactics to help develop the habit of being more open to sharing how I am feeling with people
Comments
Start small, like just sharing how your day is going, what you have done recently, plans for the future, etc. And then if that feels more comfortable, build towards maybe sharing about something you are a bit worried about or struggling a little bit with things that are more personal.

Its okay to be the type that is slow to open up. Opening up with people you are comfortable with is good practice for specific topics like mental health. You can try talking as if retelling something that happened to someone else state what happened, how it made you feel, why it bothers you. Things like that. Therapy can still be beneficial even if you only talk about superficial things for a while.

Title: Sexualidad depresin.

English is not my first language, and I have severe depression. Please be kindconfusion due to various circumstances in my life and my family. I have depression. It started as juvenile depression when I was years old at school, but even though I was treated, it never went away completely since then, I have been in intermittent treatments. Most of them stopped because they did not give resultsconfusion. I have been in treatment for a month, and although I do not cry all day and decided not to kill myself, I am worried that previous medications will inhibit my sexual desire due to the treatments. It has already happened to me, but I was in a relationship and we were able to deal with it well. But now I am single. And even though I know I am not ready to be in a relationship right now, I worry about having to choose between my mental health and my sexual desire. I know that the decision does not have to be now, but how can I deal with this? I am not asexual. I want to have sexual desire again, but it has been more than years since I have been dealing with my depression. Do I have to choose between not wanting to die or being sexually active? Amp as a context? I have had treatment with pills and therapy, but only for a year or so because I have stopped them since they were not effective
Comments
I have had depression for most of my life and sex is extremely important to me right now. My depression treatment does not do anything to my libido, but I know there are pills that have been recommended that could I have a hundred other reasons to avoid the kind of meds I need to take daily but even if I didnt, it would be something I would not simply expect I would experience it if it happened and decide what is an acceptable side effect and what is not. There are different kinds of medications that fall under different categories, and if one sari messes with your libido, then maybe another one wont. Or if you are on mais, maybe two have side effects that are unacceptable to you, but one has less. So you stick with that one until you are able to try something else. I think you have to take it as if comes if you are going through the process of trying depression meds,

I cant wait for the day that I can feel normal or moreso than now. I am tired of living with my anxiety theres so many time where I have read too much into a situation and felt that I have upset or angered someone when I havent not even in my social life but also in school and games I have felt this a bad grade or poor performance almost always leads to that feeling of dread and fear I just want that day where I can be confident in what I do and not be anxious. I am hoping to talk to a doctor to see what I can do whether therapy or medication to deal with it. I am kind of looking forward to it, but I dont think itll work as well as I hope I will be glad if it is just any bit better than what it is right now.

Title: Quit vaping pregnant guilty
Thread
The guilt is eating at me I just quit vaping nicotine disposables I am weeks if I sound like a broken record I am sorry I am just going through withdrawal and fear I am honestly so proud of myself just for quitting at all but pissed at the same time I cannot believe I let myself relapse just a month into pregnancy now I am months finally quitting like what I wish I did this right and fought the temptation being my first baby I wish I just did it in the least amount of risk path to ensure their health instead of being selfish I am being hard on myself because of my hormones I think someone please give me reassurance or something I quit and I want to be excited for this loudly crying face
Comments
Hey, unfortunately we cannot change the past but we can change now and plan for the future. Try to focus on that you did change for the better you took back control. Quitting nicotine is a huge step and you can feel proud every new day without it is a win for you and your baby. Guilt and shame are very strong feelings. Tho are there any special support groups in your area forgiving others can be hard forgiving yourself. Maybe even harder. And group confusion counselling could be really helpful. Consider this when feeling guilty. Our bodies tend to shift into stress mode with all it is hormones involved that might have an effect on your baby too. Maybe you cannot cancel the feelings out completely for nowconfusion, but you can try to limit it. Set yourself a time for guilt. Whenever stag comes up, you will tell yourself, oh yes, this is the guilt again, but it is not time now I will deal with it between and am as every day. But again, quitting an addiction is a very strong move. You should celebrate all the best for you and your baby. Happy face smiley

It always ok to take time for yourself and you do not need to tell them that unless they ask if you are happy doing you then do it. You do not need to go out and do a whole bunch of things to be happy unless your making yourself less happy. Doing this, then do worry. Do what makes you feel loved by yourself.

It sounds like there are a lot of stressful and overwhelming things happening in your life at the moment. I think it makes a lot of sense that you miss the way things used to be. I know you said your family members left you because of everything that happened with your mom. Is there anyone you could live with, though with a random family member or even a friend?

Title: Why do I feel like such a burden?
Thread
I know I have toxic tendencies. I know I grew up in a household of survival, rather, then love. I know that the past is the past, and I need to move forward. My ghosts have been chasing me for as long as I can remember. I have been and continue to be haunted by memories and traumas for many years. Now, I want to get better. I want to be better. My boyfriend and other loved ones deserve that. I see a therapist once a week, I journaled, I did yoga, read the self help books I have seen. So many psychiatrists that have all put in their two cents gave their opinion on what is wrong with my brain and sends me off with cocktails of medication. Nothing helps. I am so fucking tired man, all I want to do is keep myself at a distance from people. Its easier that way safer, lonely, but less exhausting. Having to put up a front or be deceived. I feel like I do not know what it is like to have fun anymore. I am stressed, anxious, feeling sick and exhausted all the time. Some days, its a miracle to crawl myself out of bed. My boyfriend, being the wonderful man he is, offers nothing but unconditional support and understanding. He honestly gets the worst of my mood swings at times, and I feel like such a piece of shit during and afterwards I have accused him of cheating. He would honestly never. And I knowThatconfusion get upset over small things to where I just want to break everything around me and have random anxiety attacks or just disassociate completely all while holding me and loving me still, I self sabotage. I know this I have been preparing myself for the shoe to drop. Things feel too good to be true with my boyfriend. Its been almost two years and nothing has happened. Hes never even raised his voice at me when there has been situations where it could have been justified. I honestly do not fucking deserve him and feel like I do not deserve any of the good people I have in my corner. I think about breaking things off with him at times not because I want to, but I am sure there is someone out there way less fucked up then me. And things could be so much easier for him. I feel like I come with way too much baggage that is just way too much to bare. I lost my dad as a child, suicidal thoughts since I was molested by a family member, was stalked and almost killed by my moms ex. I was cheated on by someone I completely gave my heart to was emotionally and physically abused. Have a potential brain injury from the abuseconfusion. Had two miscarriages. One sibling is a coke addict, the other an alcoholic. My mom checks out randomly where I never hear from her. My boyfriend is getting deployed next month, and I will not see himFor nine months, I am drowning and consumed by this horrible feeling. Intrusive thoughts of ending things is becoming more periodic. And quite frankly, I am not even scared of them anymore. Theyare welcomed and almost comforting at times like a thick, warm comforter that just came out of the dryer. It could all be over so quick and easy I would be more of a burden dead then alive, though I do not know why I am saying all of this rant more then likely sounds like self loathing, nonsense. And perhaps it is

Title: Is it weird to remember dreams even from years ago?
Thread
So this is why I think I am weird, kind of. I basically remember all the dreams I have had day before, every little detail or them. If there is a stranger in my dream, I would remember their look their name. Somehow I made them up myself, I guess, confusion, color of their hair, etc. Sometimes I would remember something, and I will get this erie feeling that I not quite sure if it was a dream that I had years ago or that it really happened. I would think of a place with detailsconfusion, like the location of it, the general look of it, and ask my friends or family if we have been, they would have zero memory of what I am talking about. This extends to dreams I have had even as a teenager, like confusion I am now years old. Sometimes I would have reoccurring dreams of my husband being a dick cheating or my family being absolutely horrible to me when that is not the case in real life, like my husband and my parents are soo good to me. I do not know why this happens in my dream, and sometimes I would dream about an ex that I absolutely have zero feelings for anymore, but we would be still together in my dream, or numerous occasions where I dream that I am gay as fuck, like I would be having sexual relationship with women, and that I would be coming kind of in real life, like what theIs going on once I also dreamed about having a screaming match with my husband and I yelled shut up in my dream and also in real life and scared myself and my husband to a point he woke up why is this happening and is it an issue that I need see somebody over plus help

I can remember dreams from years ago. Not all of them are super vid or detailed anymore. I have dreams pretty much every night, although since I have been smoking weed, I forget them not long after I wake, which annoys me actually lol. Some I do remember, though, for example, I often have dreams of houses that have weird layouts. Some of them have rooms that are abandoned. Some of them have vines, bushes all grown on the outside. Some of them are similar to houses that I have lived in. But the layout is different and there is always random stairs. I remember a couple of dreams from when I was a teenager that were gay, as also I am transgender. But even before I knew I was trans, I would always be male in my dreams, I remember being told as a kid that your dreams are your subconscious unpacking and going over everything that is happening in your life.

No judgement, but sounds like you may have some issues to sort out regardless. Remembering dreams from long ago is normal, coincidently. I was literally just thinking about this at dinner last night when my daughter was telling us about a weird dream she would had recently, and I was going to mention one I had in I am and still vidly remember years later.

I am starting cut therapy and I am wondering about topics I can bring up. Alright so I have certain behaviours that are nsfw and my behaviours have essentially taken over my life.

I have been diagnosed with gad and mad when I was in the grade. Now, I am a sophomore in college. I have been in therapy since then and am on zoloft, which has helped me immensely. I really felt like I had my issues under control. A couple weeks ago, however, I got rejected from a capella groups, and it started a panic attack, which is fine. I get a couple a month and take clonazepam for them, except I have now consistently been having them since times a week. At the same time I am experiencing a depressive episode. My intrusive thoughts are worse, lots of nausea, disassociation in the morning, unable to sleep, its so frustrating and upsetting. I do not understand what is happening. How do I stop this sudden regression? I do not feel upset. I just am having a chemical issue, I think,

Title: I think my mom needs help but will not accept it and it is ruining my life help.
Thread
I know that sounds terrible, but I am really, at my breaking point with this. My mom has a long history of taking advantage of people being terrible with money and overall, being a very childish individual. She in her and I am her only child, we have cousins, but no immediate family. My grandma, her mom passed away a few years ago, and that was who she relied on to pay the rent she had previously lost our house after my ma put her name on it after a major health scare, confusion when my ma was in the hospital, I started paying her rent from across the country. They lived in the mid west, and I had since moved out to the west coast with my fiance for about years. I paid all of her rent and told her to focus on getting her bills paid off since she was in debt and had a terrible credit score. She did that and never paid me a cent. She seemed to be improving her ways, and in may of, I moved her out to the west coast to live with my fiance and I in a bedroom home. It started off decently. We were enjoying holidays, going to events together, but every few weeks there would be a big blowup argument between her and my fiance. It would always be the same. He is taking advantage of me or he is an asshole, etc. There was one instance where he went to grab lunch andShe thought he did not get me any. So she was mad at him, yelled at him and was hiding in her room for about a week since then. It has gotten much worse where she cannot stand him and she makes it known. Mind you, my fiance and I have been together for over a decade and are happy for the past month. She has called him names, thrown things at him, called me names, is set on thinking I have chosen him over her, which is downright silly and essentially hidden in her bedroom. My goal before she moved out here was to save up more money since I would be eliminating her rent payment from my bills and to save up for a house with an additional unit so she could have her own spot close enough in case she needed something. I no longer want to do that. I first asked her to move out, and she applied for income based housing, but was told the waitlist here was a few years long. She gets social security, but it is not enough to cover rent where we live. I told her she should move back to indiana, but really has not budged, because I do not think social security would cover rent back home either. There is also a waitlist for income based housing there. She then told me I should pay for her to go somewhere and was sending me links to houses to buy for her. Here I am nowFully aware my mom has not changed, only really is nice to me when I am providing for her in one way or another and I cannot handle it anymore today she was slamming things down on the floor upstairs so that I could hear it downstairs and was pretending like she was falling so I would take her to the hospital when I called her out on it she called me an ungrateful little bitch and slammed the door in the last weeks I have been trying to weigh options of renting or buying her a house back in the midwest, where I could potentially afford it while it is more affordable than the west coast. I would still be paying about monthly plus all of the costs to move her back. I have tried telling her to just get out and figure it out herself, but she refuses. She has burned so many bridges with any of the rest of the family that I am the only one left. I am sick of putting my life on the back burner. I did the math, and I realized I had paid over in rent for her over the past few years and have nothing in savings for myself that could have been a downpayment for my own house. There is so much more to all of this, but I am just exhausted. I work a lot, so it has been worrying about what doors she is going to slam when I am in meetings orIf she is going to push through the door while I am in a zoom call, etc. I truly think she has an emotional imbalance of some kind. She refuses to go for any therapy because she thinks they only want to make you cry as she puts it. I do not want to put my mom on the street, even though she treats me like garbage. I know this is a loaded question, but what can I do if she is unwilling to get help? What options are there? Thank you in advance.

Title: I need some advice.
Thread
Hi I do not even know how to start this I in highschool and my mental health is something I ve been struggling with for so long and it is becoming so overwhelming I have missed over days of school this year alone I have not been to school since I was in the gradeconfusion this is my first year trying to start attending and well it is just so bad I cannot go more than days a week and when I do I do not go for two weeks after that but that is not really what im here to vent about last year around may I picked up a bad drinking habit. I drank in my room alone about every night until I did something bad to myself under the influence around the end of late november so my parents found out and hid all alcohol nowadays I eat until I make myself sick or physically harm myself. Recently, I was taken out of therapy because the company said my attendance was horrible and that I didnt talk about how I felt enough, which I personally think I did try my best to communicate, and I felt like I was doing good, especially thinking about the fact that they changed my therapist every months. But not only that they were saying how people do not need therapy forever, and that I should just take a break. But besides all that my parents refuse to take my alcohol situation seriously, they really do not thinkIt was a problem, but I personally can see how much of a problem it is, especially now because it is all I think about, and I am turning to any form of self harm to try and help the craving for alcohol. I struggling now more than ever, even though ive been feeling these things since the age of I just so lost, I feel so alone. I so mean to people like my boyfriend constantly. And to be honest, besides him, I have like other friend, and I just have no one. I am so incredibly lost. I dont know what my next step should be. Im hurting really bad and everyone is failing to listen.

I believe this is a highly individualized question, as what you need want from a therapist can differ greatly. Many therapists will list their area of expertise online and their therapeutic approach, as well as specific issues they are capable, willing to support you with what applies to you, will depend on your experiences and diagnosis.

Im taking wellbutrin as well. And celexa and I do not really have emotions either. Like you. I have no problem with laughing, but a lot of times, I feel empty. Some meds do have that side effect of emotional blunting. I am making an app with my do to see if she can add a new med to help with that. Maybe try that or just talk to ur do and see what they say.

When did these feelings start? I have friends who take wellbutrin, and it is been known to cause these feelings. I would call your doctor and tell them how you are feeling. This medicine may not be for you.

I am in no way suicidal. I do not want to kill myself. However, I do sometimes wish I would not wake up after going to sleep at night. Does anyone here have any introspective thoughts or advice on this? These feeling are fairly new to me and are bit scary. I would have never guessed there would be a point in my life where I wish I was not living.
Comments
I am sorry you are feeling like thisi do not have a ton of expertise or advice, but thoughts like these or similar ones, like I wish I were never born or I do not want to exist, are commonly called passive suicidal thoughts, or a passive death wishconfusion, which are a step down from active ones where you have a plan or are looking for ways to dieconfusion. And fairly common for me, I struggle with avoidance issues, and it makes sense to me that rather than deal with my problems, I would rather just die. And that is a response that I am trying to. Challenge. Therapy is helpful for figuring out where those feelings are coming from, how to deal with them, and also just for being a more emotionally healthy person. So if you have not given it a shot, it may be helpful for you. Thats my two cents on it, not sure if it is what you were asking for, but I hope you feel better soon.

Title: I just found out I was ab sed as a child.
Thread
Me confusion and my mother were having a day trip when the topic of my uncle came up he is currently in an international custody battle and my mother testified on behalf of his now ex wife during the hearings his many allegations of se ual ab se against children came up including his step daughter confusion his sons and a neighbor girl he was charged with the gestation of a year old girl around years ago but was found not guilty by blaming it on my then year old cousin long story short my mom and I were discussing this when she brings up the fact that she suspects that my uncle tested my as a young toddler he was living with my parents at the time. He was confusion and my parents were unaware that only a few years prior he had inappropriately touched another prepubescent girl. Apparently when I was around, I started showing signs of ab se such as putting objects up my gen talsconfusion. My mother was so concerned that she took me to the do, but they could not confirm it. Basically, the do suggested keeping a very close eye on me and my parents never let me be alone with my uncle or really any menconfusion after that. My mother never told me this before, because she said she was not sure. But she said she believes this may be linked to some mental health issues I have been facing. I do not remember anything or any abuse, howeverI do remember an acute awareness of sexuality very young, well beyond what I should have known. Sadly, it did not shock me really when my mom told me this, obviously we do not know for sure, but I basically believed it right away. Overall, I am not necessarily mad that my mom did not tell me. I mean, how do you even bring up something? You do not want to be true. But with my uncles trial, I know it is been on her mind a lot. I feel sick about it and anxious, and I do not know what to do. Tldr my mother told me my ab sive ped uncle may have ab sed me as a child, and I am not sure how to process it

Its been like this since I started self harming about years ago, I will pull my hair, dig my nails into myself, scratch myself and hit myself. Just as a reaction to an embarrassing memory do other people do this, too. Is there a specific name for it ink? Maybe it is just a me thing

I do not know if there is a name for it, but I feel that way too. It does not even have to be a really bad memory a lot of the time.

So I grew up thinking I just had depression, a psychiatrist said I also had abandonment disorder and ptsd at, but that was it. As I grew older, I had bad relationship after bad relationship, it was not until I experienced the most painful breakup at age is when I realized that something was wrong with me. Most people would say I am a more calm, cool person with a dry sense of humor. I am not very talkative very much a people watcher, introverted. I was a receptionist at a psychology clinic, and I was talking about how I would act when my so and I would get into fights, I would get physical, shoved him onto the couchconfusion, cut myself, break things, anxiety attacks, punch walls would block the door so he could not leave. She told me that it sounded like I have borderline personality disorder. So I did the neuropsychological testing at my job and got diagnosed with these ptsd, major depression, with anxious distress, borderline personality disorder, adhd attachment and abandonment disorder. Since these diagnosis, I have done a ton of work on myself, got medicated for the bad and depression, and with my bad symptoms dying down, I have since been diagnosed with more things. Ocd sensory processing disorder, auditory processing disorder. My adhd is my whole being at this point, ha amp everyday is hardMy memory is non existent but what I have really been struggling with lately is my attachment abandonment I have been trying to date again but I do not connect with men or if I do I attachment immediately and they become my whole world that happened times in the past two years I am still struggling to react to situations in a healthy way that is going to be a lifelong struggle and I need a very caring partner if I do not like a man immediately, I do not put forth effort it sucks I am lost on what to do and I do not know how to be a better person I try to make myself talk to them but I just hate it. I am just venting really thank you for reading.

Mind. If I vent a bit too re auditory processing disorder and dating, I love the extra derision that comes from being a male and having this all your buddies want to do is go pick up women at bars clubs, aka the noisiest places in the fucking world. And when you cannot have a suave conversation with women time and time again because you have no idea what the words are coming out of her mouth, everyone brands you as oh, he is just so bad with women, he must be nervous or something he cannot really think quick on his feet, I guess, wonderful.

Chronic ptsd is often called childhood ptsd. I think every victim of childhood trauma should see this in this video, author anna runkle talks about her study of childhood ptsd and summarizes treatments shown to help. She says that as a cptsd survivor, the thing she has found most helpful to her is dealing with the symptom known as dysregulation, which is getting very upset. I would definitely see her videos on dysregulation.

So if you all are like me, you spend way to much time on this app, probably watching activists and all the bad things happening. This really negatively impacted my mental health. But it is addictive for me. I was able to make a second account, but I had to block some of my favorites creators, so it would not become a serious one like my main account. And I cannot recommend doing this enough. Make a second account of anything that does not improve your mood and block everyone that argues are negative or does not bring you piece on the new account.

Title: How do I deal with this?
Thread
Hii. So recently my results were out and I am already so disappointed. I worked so hard for these exams so I could improve my gpa, which is currently, I am pretty sure I did well in almost all subjects, except sir. But when I got my results, I was shocked to see that I got backlogs and it is not even my fault. Cuz apparently, our uni corrected our papers very badly. I had to pay rupees for revaluation, and I am sure they are going to do nothing about our results. Now, I wish my parents had faith in me. I wish my parents understood me, or maybe I am the problem. Maybe I am not capable of anything I just want to give up on my life. I cannot do this anymore, but I am just hanging in there hoping that everything will get better.

Title: I keep having small anxiety attacks after a bad plane right
Thread
Last summer was my first time flying on the way. There was fine. I did not like it at all, but it was fine. The ride home, I was having a bad panic attack before we even got to the airport. We boarded, and my anxiety got even worse. We took off and I was crying and shaking. I ended up taking one of my hydroxyzine to help the nerves and just let me sleep the last, like, minutes of that flight, I fear has traumatized me. We hit bad turbulence from some terrible storms leaving where we were going. People we are bouncing up pretty hard. The lights flickered, then went off, and I felt us drop. All I could do was hold my husband hand and look at him. I have never, and I am very serious. I have never felt fear like that. Maybe terror or despair is the correct word. Even typing this, I started shaking and tearing up when I started typing. What happened now? I have nights. Were that memory just comes up for no reason. I have a very vid imagination, so I can clearly see that memory. My stomach will lurch, my throat tightens, my heart rate shoots up and I can feel the thumping throughout my body. I will shaking and start crying. I hate this. I hate having to relive that memory all the time. I was so sure the plane was going to crash. I keep telling myself, it is ok. You are here youAre safe, but it does not help. I know I am safe, but the fear of that incident just stays. I will never fly again. I would rather drive coast to coast than take a plane ever again. I just do not know how to cope with this.

Title: No place in this world.
Thread
So confused in my life right now, my mom died a week before christmas, and I have not worked in years because of cancer. I am single and thankfully never had children. I am an alcoholic and practice daily. I now have a colostomy bag because of my cancer, and know my chances of a relationship are virtually impossible. I do not even know what to do without having alcohol in myself. I am literally hoping I die as soon as my chihuahua tupeloconfusion does. I have some? But have been on the lower end of the food chain for most of my time? I guess I am just venting. But if someone else has had these feelings and overcome them, I would love some advice. I am sorry to sound like a little bitch, but I am just scared and alone.

Title: Craving for connection but too anhedonic to connect ever felt this way.
Thread
A wave of emptiness always follows. After I finish my online shift, I always think it would be nice to have someone to vent to after a long, stressful day, but I have no one, and I only have myself to blame. I craving for connection, but at the same time, I too lazy and emotionally flat to initiate or sustain conversations with people. It is been months now, and this social anhedonia only lets up when I on ritalin. Even just writing this post, I had to force myself, because I feel like I do not know how to express myself anymore. Anyone else been there. How were you able to get out of the rut? I know that having friends as your support system is important in dealing with depression and anxiety, but how does one make friends when one is too anhedonic?

Title: Looking for a similar experience.
Thread
Some backstory about me. I am diagnosed with depression, asperger's anxiety and ptsd due to prior trauma. I have been trying to figure out just what the heck I have been experiencing periodically for what feels like years. Now, sometimes when I listen to some music that I really enjoy, and the song plays a really intense or enjoyable part, basically something that makes me think, holy shit! That is awesome confusion. I get this rush of emotion that is mostly sadness from what I can tell. It makes me scrunch up my face a little, and it feels like I am about to start crying, but it is so short, and the feelings associated pretty much instantly go away to the point that it seems almost like a tic. I have noticed this event being triggered by some other things, although they all are very similar in my opinion, such as watching movies and to, or playing a video game, all when something cool, intense, enjoyable happens. Like above, I have asked doctors and such about it, and the most I have gotten was maybe hormones being out of wack. But everything seemed ok from a strictly physical health point of view. Anyone else experience something similar or have any ideas as to what this could be edit. I forgot to mention that it seems to me that it is almost as if experiencing an intense emotion caused from enjoying the certain types of activities allows other emotions to slip through due to whatever reasonBut that could just speculation.

Sometimes when listening to some songs, I get this wave of like a really intense feeling ink, what the feeling is exactly, but often I will shiver and get goosebumps and kind of feel like I am going to cry. Sometimes the feeling is kind of like anxiety ink, but like you said, it only lasts a second or so then disappears. Sometimes I will experience it when watching a movie that maybe hits a little close to home in some way, or if I can relate to a character, and then something drastic happens to them or something

Title: I need your thoughts on this situation.
Thread
Hello, everyone. We are three sisters. A confusion, me, confusion and we have been through alot of bad things since we were kids, divorce father completely abandons us extreme war traumas, mother is really traumatized and always triggeredconfusion. We moved alot and lost alot of loved ones over time. Now, alongside with all of that, my mom always compared me and a to for me, it was about how skinny and tall she is. I and more on the thick sideconfusion. And she used to make comments everytime I eat or so and biz of that. I dealt with ed for three years and I am unable to eat in front of people. But for a, the comparison was about her communication and social skills, even though a is overweighted and have heard bad comments about her looks, all her life a has social anxiety and overthinks. Alot. So a confusion used to ask to teach her how to deal with situations and what to say. But then a got into college first year of college was normal. She had one friend, she did the second year twice and failed, and then she suddenly stopped going. And now it is been three years a did not leave home and barely left her room. She does not talk to any of us. Full conversationconfusion. She just asks for what she wants, and thats it, and lies when asked about anything. All she do is listen to songs, eat and sleep, and she keeps laughing for no reason.And talks to herself now, we know she needs therapy as soon as possible, but she is in denial. She does not know she is not okay and we cannot force her to go anywhere. She does not leave the house at all. And if we brought her a therapist, she would not talk to them or even leave her room to see them. My family and I are so worried and we honestly do not know what to do. So does anyone knows how we can deal with this and make her see a therapist?

Hi. I. Confusion got my first job in business intelligence. I have days where I work from home and days in the office.

Confusion I do a lot of work on it. I take meds, zoloftconfusion, go see a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I have nice canceling headphones to deal with the open space. I did not disclosed any of this with my boss. I am very afraid to be fired because I cannot work like a normal employee, even if I am confident I can do my job. The high iq helps me be really fast, so I can do my work wellconfusion. But sometimes it is difficult for me to work. I go hide in the bathroom when I have panic attacks, for exampleconfusion, it also difficult. Hiding it, and I do not want to be rude by using the nice canceling or staying a long time in the bathroom and so on. Does anyone have ideas to help me manage my office work

Is wah days possible or does your job require certain on site duties if in the us you can ask your supervisor for additional wah or submit to he ada paperwork asking for reasonable accommodations which will be negotiated with the employer. Generally speaking, it cannot cause undue duress. For the company a cashier position cannot be wah but a cashier could be accommodated to have more breaks due to a qualifying disabilityconfusion on the treatment side. Are you doing focused therapy to address ptsd anxiety, agoraphobia, etc. Is there an evidence based treatment plan in place and you feel like progress is being made to resolve some of the core issues that contribute to your current symptoms

According to the to the ada americans with disabilities actconfusion, you should fall under a protected class which would place the responsibility of making reasonable accommodations on the employer and not you cannot be fired for it and it would be illegal for them to do so contact the he dept and allow them the opportunity to make these reasonable accommodations. Nothing you mentioned seemed unreasonableconfusion. They cannot help if they do not know and you are not required to disclose it to your direct supervisor just he your supervisor is only entitled to a little slip from he. That basically says so and so can do this and do not fuck with them about it. Congratulations on your job and for being brave in that face of struggles, best of luck and never be ashamed who you are

Title: How can I manage office work?

Hi. I. Confusion got my first job in business intelligence. I have days where I work from home and days in the office. I also have my share of mental health problems, and I have some troubles dealing with them at work. I have panic attacks with agoraphobia. I also have ptsd from abuse by my mother and rape to complete. I have a really high iq that makes me feel really isolated and autistic. Like for me, it is more a curse than a blessing.

And I ve asked countless time for a bipolar disorder diagnosis and an adhd diagnosis why? You may ask? Because it true that I ve been experiencing symptoms of both. My mom has been literally medically diagnosed with both can be hereditary, true, but there are plenty parent child combos where it will not be passed on, and many symptoms of depression, bipolar and adhd overlap. So it is up to the professionals to try to figure out what the most accurate diagnosis would be. Literally. Each and every professionnal I ve seen has brushed it off to the side and just tell me it is depression, despite some of them actually acknowledging some symptoms, manic phases, for exampleconfusion, it sucks to feel brushed off. But if you have seen multiple different providers and shared your symptoms and they believe the depression diagnosis is most accurate, there might be some truth to that. I have a male friend that saw a psychiatrist for two confusion month, asked for an adhd diagnosis and got it in like just one sentence, a few appointments would likely be enough to warrant a diagnosis. If that psychiatrist believes those symptoms to accurately reflect adhd, I saw in another post that you think xanax would help. If your hunches are correct about bipolar and adhd, no competent prescribed should give you a benzo. As those can produce significant side effects. With a concurrent bipolar diagnosis, instead, you would likely be prescribed a daily mood stabilizer for the bipolar lithium lamotrigineconfusion andPotentially vyvanse for adhd instead of adderall or ritalin due to the bipolar disorderconfusion.

I feel you op. I am diagnosed with chronic depression too, and sometimes I think I might be bipolar as well. Whenever I bring this up to my psychiatrist, he simply ignores it. Something does not feel right about this depression. It feels like something is off.

I hate school since, like, a month ago, this guy in my class keeps yelling at me when I do something wrong, I have add and ocd. So concentrating is very hard and ocd only distracts me with instructive thoughts. Today, overheard that guy saying that he wants to punch me in the face. And a few days ago, during pe, I didnt catch a ball, and he yelled, a month ago, cuz, I was in a group with him. During cooking class, I sucked at it, and he acted agressive, and classmates had to calm him behind my back. He says stuff. I dont want to go to school anymore. And if I tell anyone hes going to be even more pissed. Hes smaller, then me, but much stronger. And he works out, like every week,

If your presence is mostly online, maybe try changing your username or how people identify, you tell all the people you currently speak to that you are going to use a new account. The only issue I can imagine is if you have an account with certain features that cannot be transferred or something like that.

Title: I always expect the worst.

Do anyone relate to this? Not sure if its because ive been disappointed too many times in the past or like past trauma, I always expect the worst when it comes to relationship to my career and so on. The good thing is that it protects me and does not bother me as much when things eventually really did not work out or is not as good as I expect it to be. But the negative thing is it steals so much joy away from me. I have a hard time being happy, enjoying and appreciating the moment when something good happens, because I always expect that something bad is going to happen after that, or if something good happens. Ill think like, no. So this is too good to be true. The universe is going to send me some. So in life to deal with pretty soon, like I recently started a new job and seems like things are going pretty well. My boss likes and trusts me. My colleagues are generally okay, and I feel like I am being recognised at work. However, at the back of my head, I keep getting reminded of past bad working experiences where bosses colleagues were okay at first, then turned around and gaslight or disrespect my boundaries, and it triggers my fight or flight. I also had a pretty good date recently, and things seem to be going well. He has shown that he is obviously interested in me and is actively planning for future dates. TextsMe daily and frequently asks me about myself my life, but at the back of my head I just keep thing nah, its not going to work out because of ex better not be happy too soon. I feel like this is such an unhealthy mindset, and it prevents me from being happy, but at the same time, im so used to it.

Or if something good happens, ill think like, no, she, this is too good to be true. The universe is going to send me some she in life to deal with pretty soon. The fact is something terrible will happen to us. Sooner or later. Psychologists have been studying something we all need resilience. Optimism sometimes gets a bad rep there. Stupid optimism, which says that things are great when they are obviously not. But there is also smart optimism, which is always looking for ways to make lemonade out of the lemons. Life gives us every day big ones and little ones instead of cursing your bad luck, when things do not go as planned. Look for the advantages of the new situation. Use your imagination. This is how to be lucky. More advice from experts in my comments

I expect the worse case scenario, then I am never disappointed. The problem is when something goes well, you spend of the time sad about expecting the bad that it makes enjoying the good not as fun.

Title: I am tired of everything.
Thread
It has been almost exactly years since my confusion, mom, confusion, mental health issues started. I guess it was way long before than that. My earliest memory of childhood is getting cursed at, and being beaten by my mom when I was, because she was sad on her older brother for some unknown reason. But I was the only way she could vent her anger. Needless to say, it continued every day. Every singe day. It hurt my soul and mind more than it did to my body. But growing up, I came to know that it is normal in asian households. I accepted it fast forward. Whenever my parents are sad, I play the house clown. It is okay, though, because I do not feel bad in making others laugh. In the last years, my mom has started showing psychotic behaviours, such as she keeps telling my dad and I that how we installed some spy devices on her phone to spy on her? No, we didn. How we want to make her crazy and others. I have taken it all in, even when she scratched on my face, or when she bit me on my leg, telling me how bad of a daughter I am that I should just die by drinking poison or by getting run over by a truck. I was okay. I recited multiples of numbers and felt okay. I am empty. For a long time, I used to care for others I used to give up my bus seats forThe elderly or pregnant women I used to give my school lunch or my pocket money to the beggars and poor children, but someday it stopped. I do not know when some days ago, a women fell on the ground just in front of me. If it were the old me, I would have rushed to help her. But that day, I did not. I just stared at her. I did not feel any emotions. I did not feel pity when she said, she is hurt her knee. I do not know. I felt nothing. I just stared, watched, walked away. This same thing happened when my mom cut her hand in a suicide attempt. Months ago, I stared, informed my dad and went on instagram. I do not feel anything since the grade, really, I just act an endless performance for to audience today. Something happened. My mom called me to her room and showed me some papers and asked me why the dates are different. She joined collage on a whim, long distance education, and started studying for her masters degree in english confusion. I explained to her, but she was not having it and accused me and my father that we are trying her make her mad and have her inheritance she received from my grandpaconfusion. I told her to just die somewhere and give me peace. Yes, I did exactly what she did to me. I do not know if it hurt her, and I really hope not. I do not knowWhy I said it I was not even angry I don even feel sad or pity when people die I used to cry when puppies would die so what is wrong with me without feelings? Am I still human what do I do I have not felt since the grade it been so long will I ever get back my empathy I am sorry for babbling for so long but I really cannot say anything to my friends or anyone close to me because I do not want them to know I do not even care if I die but dying is inevitable and in no way I am committing suicide I am just telling in case I die I wanted someone to know

Title: Meta question. Using techniques and strategies to combat depression is just as exhausting as the depression itself. Any advice please.
Thread
Any advice, please.

Depression conveys a sense of fatigue when people are depressed, light exercise will generally energize them. People say, I know there are things that will make me feel better getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning. But I am depressed, and I do not have the energy. The thing is, people do have energy when they are depressed as much energy as they always do. But for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy. We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks. This is a motivation trick that is been used in behavior modification programs since the if a task seems like it is too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy cleaning start by cleaning for, or min, and take a min break. A famous psychiatrist said that when we cannot control our feelings, we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey. Try this when it seems that you are too tired to work, lie on the couch, close your eyes and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for minutes. Again, think in terms of taking it step by step and starting with something really easy. If you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. NoOne size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also, traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this oneembarrassed or blushing.

My not sure it is the answer you want. Sometimes when we learn new tasks or skills or techniques, they can feel exhausting at first. The idea is that with practice and over time, these techniques become easier for us to utilize and replace the natural pathways they are designed to augment. Similar to starting a fitness routine or education program, it will be very challenging at first, but should calm down over time. Best of luck.

I should stop living I know what I need to do I know I need to call my doctor therapists psychiatrists school and start going to my appointments again I know I need my meds but I am so scared I feel so terrible for getting rides from my insurance because I do not feel comfortable in a car with family I know I should clean my room and do what my therapists suggests but what is the point? I just do not care anymore and I want to so bad and I need to so bad but I can I cannot do things when I am not interested or it feels like I should rip my skin off my face and hit myself in my head I have not done anything to help myself in over a month, and my family just does not notice. How can they not notice that I need help? How come after my attempt? My father was worried about my brother sleeping during the day because its a sign of depression. And so he told everyone to have an eye on him. But I have not been outside in months, have not left my room, have not been able to get out of bed and no one bats an eye. I am tired of living and putting in my effort for everyone. It always has to be for someone. Well, what about me? I am so tired I want to move on already. Please, let me move

Title: My girlfriends daughter is cutting herself.
Thread
Will keep this short my girlfriends year old daughter has been caught hiding scissors knives in her room and over the past years has been increasingly adding small but increasingly not so smallconfusion cuts to her body she has had mental health anxiety for about ish years now is getting emotional support from a child psychologist psychiatrist has problems learning at school and finds high school really hard she tells us that she uses cutting to release the build up of tension from stress from her school and get life that never gets better I am really hoping to get some advice from anyone who has been in a similar situation or even someone who has struggled with cutting themselves to help me understand a way out so that we can guide her in the right direction and offer her the help she needs. We ve hidden all knives and scissors in the house but this is just a temporary fix. This does not get to the root of the problem and solve anything we know she can get her hands on sharp items. If she feels like doing it again, any guidance would help so much. Thanks, guys

Title: Some insecurities.
Thread
My body is frail and I am not best looking, and I have been through a lot of shit mentally still. I keep it on the low, because I have to overcompensate with my personality. I present myself as charismatic and confident, when, in reality, I am always anxious and depressed. If I open up, I lose all appeal. I am supposed to be the one who has his shit together, so I have to keep acting as I do, hopefully doing so does not kill me, but it is getting harder and harder. The worst part is I can get so displaced from reality and find myself way overcompensating, making me seem selfish and full of myself. I should not have the big ego that I sometimes do, and that ego keeps me from sharing some deep things that go on in my mind. Even though I know that my boys will have my back, I still have trouble even opening up to them, finding myself in darkest of places, feeling so alone. The worst part is I have kept this up for so long that I have built a reputation where people see me as the guy to look up to the guy that is doing it right? Though it seems like it came easy, I have jumped over so many fucking hurdles, a lot of which I end up putting up myself. I am so good at making things incredibly harder than they have to be, and they keep on getting harder, notSure how long I can continue. I am fighting for my life every day. I have unintentionally created a presupposition in everyone is mind that I am expected to be successful. The pressure of me not holding up to that idea hurts and I am getting really tired.

Title: Confusion I fucked up my life.
Thread
I here I moved across the country to wyoming, from florida with my boyfriend, confusion, who I was not even with for a year yet stupid. I know I quit my job that I loved. I left the place I called home and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. Things are not going smoothly. Its the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues. Communication has gotten the worst it is ever been minor, but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me he would be better about lack of trust in him due to his lies baggage on his end, causing major strain between the two of us mother in law, exesconfusion. I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end, since I quit my well paying job in florida to come here. My credit cards have not gotten paid since november and my bank account is, he told me he was going to take care of me financially. He hasnt. I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in florida for years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings were not reliant upon some guy I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced bed bath apartment back in florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now I threw away everything I valued andLoved about my life for some guy that cannot even be honest with me on a consistent basis for a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me for a guy who just does not understand me, even though he likes to act like he does, I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid. And you want to know what the worst part is. I do not think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make a month now I am not only broke I am in severe debt now things will never be the same because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was. I guess I cannot even do that, right? I am quite literally good for nothing. I should have done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. I do not even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I cannot even be mad at him. I did it to myself.

Funny I came across this after searching wyoming, because I also just moved here across the country, though I am here for a amid different circumstances, and im staying positive, I continue to find myself questioning my decision to move my life out here. And if I made the decision because I wanted to run away from everything back east, I do not think so, but it hangs over me like a dark shadow. Family and friends are nowhere close, and meeting people here is much more difficult than anticipated. I find myself even missing the simple pleasures of conversation I know now seems like all hope is lost and you have given up a life that you cannot get back. Let me reassure you. That is not the case. There is light at the end of this tunnel, and there are people close in proximity, like myself, who is going through something similar if we help and support each other through these periods of darkness, we are sure to make it to the light quicker than anticipated. You are in my prayers. And if you need someone to talk to, I am much happy to be there for you. Happy face or smiley

You are far too young to have fucked up your life permanently. Things can do change, though it may not be easy. Try to get out. Sounds like that is what you really need. Good luck.

You made a mistake which is fine now do not make a second mistake by staying with him the longer you wait, the more difficult it is to get your life back on track, contact your old job and ask if you can return for example.

I feel like my mental illness has been progressively getting worse lately, I have been having these delusions in my head that help me justify picking fights with people I love in attempts to get them to push me away. I have these extreme moments, and then in them I hear people speaking when they are not. It scares me I do not have a proper diagnosis. I have been to therapy and been put on wellbutrin when I was a teenager. But it did not work very well for me and scared my mom, so she pulled me out and off medication. My maternal grandmother is diagnosed with schizophrenic bipolar disorder, and my father has bipolar disorder. I do not know if these things are hereditary, but it does concern me, I think at the very least, I am depressed, so I need help, understanding how I can go get help. As someone who is broke and does not currently have insurance. I do not want to hurt the people I love anymore. I am in the us, particularly kentucky. If that matters,

Check out this resource and reach out to a clinic in your county. This is provided by your state. So costs may be more reasonable in order to allow folks who are struggling to, seen and evaluated by a professional. If costs are a burden, maybe reach out to catholic charities of louisville in my area. They provide a lot of small grants for people struggling with mental health like temporary hotel stays, rent assistance, etc. And zero requirement to be catholic or christian or anythingembarrassed or blushing.

During the pandemic I was working in home office a lot and started drinking more coffee during the day. One day I realised my coffee machine was not really working properly any more. The pump was struggling, so I brought it to get fixed. It not a particularly high end model. It was moderately expensive for me at the timeconfusion years ago, but I have grown to like it. The service technician told me that the price of fixing it would be roughly the same as purchasing a new machine with pretty much the same performance sounds like a no brainer, right? Well, I paid for the repair. I am still using my old coffee machine. It not the best it is not the most expensive. It probably give me more trouble in a few years, but you know what I still want my machine we ve shared a lot of time together. I know it sounds stupid when I write itconfusion, but I have grow attached to my coffee machine. It does not have a proper temperature control, but I know precisely when to switch it on. The water tank is a bit small, but I know exactly how many cups of coffee I can make. I do not care if there are better ones. The usage of the machine has long become muscle memory. It feels familiar. I know it inside and out. I do not want to change it for any other unless it categorically cannot be repaired. You never know what peopleMight value about you. Sometimes it is the small stuff, the insignificant things that make us irreplaceable to others. You cannot change that. You cannot control that, but you can accept that you can accept yourself. Human relationships are born out of familiarity, of acceptance. Nobody wants a partner who is perfect is inhuman. Perfect is in the eye of the beholder. I have a crush on a woman who seems to have similar self esteem issues to me, and you constantly belittling her achievements, always looking for the negative. I am pretty sure she thinks, just as I do, as you do. But when I see her, I see the most beautiful woman in the world fuck perfect. How mundane and boring and soulless would that be?

I confusion, think I have always had self esteem issue when I look back. But now I think it is bad than it ever was when I tried to analytically assess myself. There is not even anything wrong with i. He, above average, looks good in my works. Good at painting, he an healthy routine, but I constantly focus on trivial, not so good things about myself, like how I walk or talk or anything like that. I have this desperate urge to do everything perfectly or else people will be disappointed by me, and people being disappointed is probably my biggest fear. I want to work on myself, but I do not know what to even work on with my present emotional state. I barely he a social life

I understand that very well. Talking about it helps a little. It hard to constantly feel like you are not good enough. If you are not perfect, you do not have to be perfect to be loved and to be great. It hard to believe. But it is true. If you want someone to talk to, I am here. I hope you have a great night.

I think building your social life may help with these issues. If you can hopefully, youll realise that people are not as critical as you think it might be hard but if you keep pushing, I am sure you will get to a point where you will be happy with yourself and where you are.

Title: Change of mindset, or fast mood swings.
Thread
My mood has always been very easily changed, but only in specific situations or with specific, important people in my life. I would not think twice about an insensitive comment made by a colleague or a friend, even but would get deeply hurt by an unintentional, offhand remark by a boyfriend or a family member, specifically my mom. And I do not think it is necessarily just because I consider those people more important and are naturally more influential. I think it has something to do with trauma or past hurt, being tied to those people or their roles in my life. The thing is, I have always noticed that although I am easily hurt, I also recover quite fast. That has always been the case for years now. And it makes me feel like my mood changes drastically in a short period of time. It makes me feel like something is wrong with me. Because, for example, after a fight with a boyfriend, if it takes him a day to recover and feel okay to talk about, it takes me an hour, although during that hour, I feel intensely sad. Its like my emotions feel more intense than everyone elses, but take less time to pass through me. Two days ago, I had a huge fight with my boyfriend, and we almost broke up. I was left feeling really down. I felt like I genuinely wanted to shrink myself and disappear. It was the worst I have felt in about month. And then I kindOf decided to do something about it. I picked up a book that I know can change my mindset meditations by marcus aurelius great bookconfusion and called up a friend to go out later in the day. And that was enough. I got back home feeling a lot more hopeful, and I felt like I have successfully made a choice that it does not have to affect me in that way. But I still cannot help but think that my mood has drastically changed in the span of two days. And this is a pattern of mine. It is not always done by an active change of mindset. It sometimes just happens I would easily get hurt, and then it would take me way less time to recover from it and even be ready to forgive. So anyone with similar experience or knowledge is something wrong here or am I just emotionally fast paced?

Title: How do you earn life?

I do not think you can, I hate myself. I should be starving. I should be terminally ill or living in a third world country, I do not deserve to have a bed and food and water. I do not deserve to wake up to birds chirping instead of gunshots. Everyone. And anyone deserves this more than me. I am sorry. I got lucky. I am a useless piece of crap, and I do not deserve to be alive and healthy. I am not good enough, and I never will be. I am not perfect, so I cannot love myself. I will not deserve to live until I perfect and I never will be. I wake up a think about all my flaws and how many things I could do better can anyone help me? I do not understand why I am alive. No one would care if I died and I would not, but I must, because I am still here. I do not want to live anymore, but death probably is not better. Does anyone want to talk? Please? I am sorry.

You do not need to earn life. We are all broken and are trying our best every day. Just try and be honest with yourself, what drives you? What do you enjoy doing to be human? Well, automatically, we are flawed. No one is perfect. You could be completely perfect. Looking on the outside, but be a horrible, uncaring person who only cares about material things. I did not ask to be born. I am no better than anyone else. Just try your best everyday and be true to yourself. Be kind, caring. Be a light to this world which dwells in so much darkness and chaos. Strive to be the very best you. It does not take hardly any effort to be a kind, caring, decent human being. Sometimes all it takes is a smile to brighten someone else. Day, go for a walk. Make a new friend, walk your dog, if you have one, do something you enjoy and join with others who enjoy the same things I love walking on the beach. So my plan is to move in a couple of months closer to the ocean. Every day is a new day to find something new to love. I love to hear birds chirping, so I like going down the street to the park and lay back on a blanket and listen to them when it is warmer. Hope, this lifts your spirits

Title: I rarely cry like really rarely, but when I do it is for a stupid reason or it is really not a big deal.
Thread
So basically I am a grown man. Im and I do know that I lives my whole life under a huge stress and from a really young age, let us say from age till now, but I know how to deal with it alone, cause I always did. But the last years have been pretty hard on my I went, threw my first love breakup, but still I moved on. And I do not think I have some mental health issues or do i? Thats why I am seeking answers in here. So please be generous if you have been threw this. I mean, sometimes it is hard and tiring to be strong all the time. Anyways, the first time I cried for a stupid reason was when I hit my dads car, and he was so cool with it, he did not even yell at me. So I cried for that cause. Jedi did not punish me or yell at me. And the second time was today at work. So like my boss kept telling that I pretty much fucked up my job this whole month and shit. But he was so cool with it. Our relationship is like brothers. He is like a brother to me, and I have never had a big brother. So like, he is my big bro and also my cousin. So he was talking and telling me how I did bad this month. And boom, I started tearing. He was like, yo, chill, I do not mean that. AndWe casually ignored what happened and shit and we cool anyways. Can someone help or guide me I really need answers red heart.

Title: Writing a letter to my sons mother.
Thread
Hey guys. I was diagnosed with ptsd in while in the military. I was violently raped and beaten by three people. This was not combat related. I am a male and could not speak out of some sort of shame or guilt. I was married to my high school sweetheart, then until we divorced about years ago, I had gotten hooked on benzos and shut everyone out, including her. I am clean. Now we have a son together who was born in, and he is starting to ask questions about us. And I do not know what to tell him. I tried therapy and medication for years and got nowhere because could not even be honest with myself about what had happened and what we were going through. We still do not talk unless it is about our son. I texted her a few years ago, finally saying, I was raped and got no response. Ive since made leaps and bounds of progress through my recovery, and I feel I need some closure. I want to tell her everything my goal is not to get her back. I just feel I cannot be whole until she knows the story. Is it a bad idea to try and give her a letter explaining things? I do not know how to proceed, and I really do not want to tell my son something I shouldnt. I do not want to compromise her happiness. Shes with another guy now and I do not know if it is inappropriate, whatDo you guys think sorry if this was a jumbled mess?

Are you struggling with suicidal thoughts? Do you know someone who is struggling but cannot understand them? Well, I had been suicidal for ten long years from to a decade survived but lost to self hate? My last attempt was on the and of january, in honor of these four years, without an attempt. I created a comic to provide something for other survivors, because I know how fucking lonely it is in this dark pit, and how fucking endless this hole of self hate and desperation can feel. Sadly, I cannot post an image here. So here you go. You will never be alone with feeling alone.

Hello, I am about too turn, and im still not sure where my life direction is going. I think the tough part here is society says, we have to have a successful job, kids, etc. By a specific age. Its so exhausting. I say, do what makes you happy? Find your passion, even if that means switching jobs, careers, etc. At whatever age? Heck, when I was in college, there was a guy in my cohort that quit his job at. I, best of luck, your friend and okay, therapist.

Sounds like taking some time off to, with recover and also re evaluate what is important in life would be beneficial, especially since you have a cushion to pay for basic necessities for a while. There is likely more meaningful things out there for you both work and non work, and you may need some time and clear headspace to figure that out. Good luck.

Title: Trying new meds and tired of new things popping up and hoping someone else has been through this.
Thread
I. Nbconfusion have been diagnosed with major depressive and generalized anxiety. I have dealt a lot with post traumatic stress, but I do not know if I was diagnosed with ptsd. I was taking lexapro for almost years before my dad passed. It was working well, but with all the added stress of grief, I went to my psychiatrist to get something to give it a boost. Since I was dealing with a lot more ideation again and was fighting everyday not to relapse on. So I always like to do research before I talk to him. So I have an idea of what has been researched to be effective, and we agreed that wellbutrin would likely combine well with the lexapro. After a couple months, I noticed my anxiety was way down, and I was not isolating myself as much and now able to deal with day to day. It was incredible my whole life. No matter what I have taken or what counseling I am in, there has been anxiety in the background. I call it my radio staticconfusion. But then there was a new issue. I was forgetting most of my day, unable to focus or pay attention, even while driving, thinking it was a side effect. I talked to my doctor again about trying another atypical antidepressant instead of the wellbutrin. He was concerned that I had a head injury, since those symptoms are not related to either of my meds unless it was serotonin syndrome, which would have appeared when iFirst started after exploring a bit more of the experience. And if this had ever happened before yes to a much smaller extentconfusion, the conversation moved to the possibility of untreated adhd. He was not the first person to ask if I had it. I work in behavioral health and over people clients, coworkers boss, family membersconfusion had asked, averaging about times a week, many asking multiple times after explaining that I was extremely inattentive as a kid, but it got a bit better when I was a teenager, when my anxiety got severeconfusion. He theorized that the cortisol adrenaline gaba and norepinephrine associated with anxiety kept me more aware and focused, which masked the adhd for a while, until the anxiety was being treated with the wellbutrin. He prescribed ritalin as a sort of test to see if it helps. It really does. And for a bit, I felt like an actual person and was functioning better than I ever have. My husband and I were both so happy, and I sobbed because I started continued and finished dishes a particular chore I have always struggled with, because it requires attention without much movement and activityconfusion. This celebration was short lived, though, after about a week, I started experiencing a lot of anger that I have suffered and struggled for years. I also started getting a lot more depressed and feeling significant self hatred that I would spent years in therapy improving. I ended up relapsing on my so and feeling a lot more ideation.Because I feel so worthless and my productivity at work dropped again. Now I am thinking that one of the antidepressants needs to go, because I likely have too much serotonin now, not enough for serotonin syndrome, but enough that it contributed to my confusion and is now lowering my mood. I do not know I am so tired of patching one hole just for another to burst open. My concern with taking away the lexapro is that I have never done well with withdrawing from sis, even if it is gradual. And what if it just gets worse after I am off then it take months for it to work again? If I lose the wellbutrin, I have to have the radio static again. And I have enjoyed being able to trust people more and having a quieter mind and less psychomotor agitation bouncing my legs, trembling, hands chewing my lips, skin picking the whole shebangconfusion. I do not want to lose the progress I have made with these. But the depression is getting overwhelming, and the internalized anger is almost more than I can take. I almost so at work because I felt I was not being productive enough because I was depressed. I know this experience is pretty specific, but please, I need to know that someone else has gone through this. And some advice on what I should do. I hate the cycle of trying something new, and it either does not work or it does, but something else goes awry. AndThen trying something else do I need to stop one med more than one or do I need more meds I just want to feel normal and I am getting so tired of this struggle I do not want to be fighting for my life everyday in a fight that no one can see there no heart attack or stab wound that people can look at and know how hard it is it all in my head I hate myself again over things that I know are not my fault or are not a big deal and why should I try so hard for someone I hate I have safety measures to keep myself safe and a support system but it can be hard to tell them how far I have fallen when just a month ago I was doing so good to do. I have been trying different meds, but they always bring up other symptoms of yet another mental illness I probably have. After finally getting a good treatment for anxiety, I showed strong symptoms for adhd again. After treating adhd depression is really strong again, and I do not want to be a guinea pig anymore.

Do not lie to yourself yet we choose how to react to it. I have seen poverty. I have seen people with degrees in best universities, cleaning the streets. I have seen people overcoming the death of all family members. Things happened to them was for no purpose. Do not blame yourself for not being able to spark any feelings to youself in others. Focus on what you love doing and what you can improve in your life. And remember, one thing about life, it has no rules. Nothing defines your failure. No law of the universe dictates that if you do not have friends that you think like youconfusion you are a failure. Find what important you dont like your friends, find other. It is easier than you think. If you try and remember that you will be a failure once you convince yourself in it

Title: I have bad and bipolar.
Thread
I have the typical anger issues, etc. But over time, I have developed a mindset that the universe is out to get me like it feels like every time something goes right there is something to ruin it. My brain has even gone as far as telling me my existence is some type of punishment and that I was not meant to be here. What is this?

Title: Scared about my dissociation.
Thread
Ever since I confusion was sexually assaulted in october I have really been struggling with dissociation. I feel like the second I feel any kind of anxiety, especially around too many people. I turn off and nothing feels real, and I feel like I am just an empty body, saying things that a person is supposed to say I recently got a therapist and she confirmed that I am valid and that I am experiencing dissociation as a trauma response which felt good to hear someone tell me that I am not crazy. I am just worried that I am never going to feel back to normal. My therapist gave me a pressure point technique to do whenever I feel especially bad, and it is actually been helpful. But temporarily, I am wondering if anyone else has had a similar struggle, and if they can lend me any techniques or resources to ground myself. Thanks.

The psychology today article recommends grounding methods. These are very simple things, like examining things and counting things. You can look up grounding and try a few of these methods. This comment has information about ptsd.

If you are diagnosed with ptsd, consider asking your therapist if they are familiar with an evidence based therapy for trauma coping, such as what you two have worked on is helpful but ultimately a bandaid.

I am selfish. I am an asshole. I try to be a good person. I have tried to improve, but nothing about me has ever gotten better. People tell me that I am a good person, but I am not a lot of the time. I got in a car crash recently and broke my femur lost my job. And now I am back at an old job. I was piece of shit when I worked there before. I constantly annoyed people. I conflicted with people for no good reason. I yelled at one of my managers, I worked at another place, and it was all good. I did not do any of the stuff that made me so terrible at the first place. But this new place is busy, and I am worried that I am going to revert back to who I was before. I am worried that I never changed in the first place, if this does not work out and I am not better and I fuck this up like I always do. I am done. I cannot keep doing this. I need change. I need to change. And I do not know how to

Title: I am afraid of sleeping.
Thread
It all started years ago with my first sleep paralysis. After a while, the quantity of my paralysis increased to a point it became a usual thing for me, but with high quantity, the quality of it became low from hallucinations, both visual and audible on my first experience to simple paralysis with no effects, just a minor inconvenience I always thought it was sometimes I found myself paralysed even before falling asleep. Completly, I even was observing the room I am in with no distortions just a few times I woke up in the middle of the night and saw a bright red butterfly, which was totally unreal since the room was dark, nothing that a few blinks cant get rid of. One time, I saw sip the statue. If someone does not know it is an imaginary creature that kills you if you do not look at it. And boy, oh boy, I was staring at it after giving up and finally blinking, I realised two things it was not real, and my heart rate is highest I have ever had. Final straw was me waking up and having a panic attack I felt I am dying, and this was the end my bed will be my end. I am no longer having any of above yet. I find myself afraid of falling into the void not the unable to sleep fear, but the moderate one. The one you have to persuade yourself is childish and makes no sense. I am afraid of goingInto the depths of my own mind finding myself not being in control feeling blurred reality but the scariest thing is nothing not existing it is like death for me yet death is itself is not scary you can not experience death I can feel the nothing in my sleep I remember it is not like falling asleep and waking up with no thing between I feel the nothing I know what I felt I can measure for how long I felt it this is it is this narcolepsy what do I do is this a symptom for psychosis or schizofrenia and I do not have any help around. Even psychiatrist is both stigma and expensive I am so afraid of loosing my mind I rather die than be trapped in my head

Title: Can I get over my sensitivity to what other people think by intentionally exposing myself to mass social shaming on reddit
Thread
I am considering making posts on amitheasshole every other day. If I do this, some of these posts will be true, some will be false. The reason I am considering doing this is because I have an intense fear of social shaming and social rejection, and I worry too much. What other people think mean. Words on the internet from years ago stick with my and haunt me, repeating in my mind over and over on a constant loop. It worse, when I am accused of doing things I did not do, I am wondering if, by writing my own failings or situations where I think I am right, but I get shamed anyway, as well as being shamed for outright fabrications, I will be able to stop having these things looping in my mind, as it may callous me to them. But as I am so sensitive as it is, I wonder if this will just make the problem worse. I thought about seeing a therapist about it, but this is an immediate problem affecting my day to day life, in that I cannot read a book, watch a movie, or do my work without these negative thoughts constantly plaguing me. I am having trouble finding a therapist who will even see me and who I can afford. So I thought I might try this instead, as I just want to stop hurting and stop being haunted by these words as soon as possible. I am also worried. However, that it might make the problemWorse. So I thought I would ask for opinions here first.

Thats sort of exposure therapy, and it might help. The important thing is that it is in a controlled, safe environment. So maybe do that only on a throwaway account and delete the account and make a new one for each post. This might allow to experience it without dwelling on it. That said, I do not know that reddit is that place you want to start, that, though I am unhelpful and do not have a better social platform to suggestconfusion because, man, it seems like nobody can say anything without getting into a fight here.

Title: I do not understand myself.
Thread
I feel like the way I experience the world and process information is fundamentally different from everybody else. I cannot remember a time where I felt like somebody truly understood my problem with sensory perception I do not feel like I understand the way people interact with each other. I feel like every minute I spend with other people, I mic the way other people behave, I have no perception of how I actually feel. Its so confusing to me when people ask me how I am. I do not know like, I know if it is bad, and I can tell that I am depressed, but I cannot describe the way it actually feels, because it feels inexplicable. I do not even know if I actually feel things in the same way other people do. Its almost like I live in a completely different reality. I hate how I get with sensory shit. I do not want to habe panic attacks or hurt myself. When I am overwhelmed, I do not want to be rude to people. I hate how nobody can tell me what it is I am feeling. I honestly do not know how to get better. If I do not understand myself

I believe some do it for attention, not most, but some, but even when they do, it should not be ignored. For the underlying issues. It takes a lot to bring someone to harm themselves. And even if its just for attention, that person must be hurting a lot internally, do be so desperate.

Title: Ever since my hospitalization, my old friend group has been avoiding me.
Thread
In december, I went to the er after trying to hurt myself by drinking and smoking till I blacked out. My mental health had been swiftly deteriorating before then, but this was the tipping point. I was incredibly suicidal and unstable after getting discharged from the er. I was picked up by a friend from this group, and I had been told by the crisis team psychiatrist that I most likely had bad. I am starting debt now. But that is besides the point word got to my friends about the bad stuff. When my mental health had deteriorated. My friends in this group said I could go to them for support and that I could talk to them when I was feeling down coming back from the hospital. Nobody except my roommates and one of my friends asked me if I was ok or reached out. Two of the friends in the group stopped responding to my texts and would not reach out. I spent weeks asking them if something was wrong, but they would not tell me. They say everything fine and I need to stop overthinking. I became really lonely and bitter. I thought they cared about me it february now, and after trying to get their attention and get involved in social stuff, I decided to take a step back from initiating and contacting people. Nobody invited me to hang out with them. The groupchat I am with them in has practically gone cold. Nobody asks how I am doing or ifI would be able to do something with them. I see them in class, and they do not speak to me. They re all doing stuff together. I know since the friend I am closest to is still hanging out with them, they would tell me to get help all the goddamn time when I was at my worst, and now that I am actually healing, they have no interest in maintaining the friendship. I cannot maintain it all on my own. It not fair. I am not so lonely anymore since I have accepted the whole thing and want to move on. I feel like they blame me for something, but I do not know what
Comments
All of my friends when I was in my late teens and my twenties had a saying when you really are getting therapy and treatment, you quickly find out who your real friends are my diagnosis was not found out until recently I am in my fortiesconfusion all the same even my friends told me it is a damned good thing. We are such fast friends because the way I act at times would scare any new ones right off. Having mentally ill friends is fun as long as you all respect that time spent in leisure activities and so on is not therapy or time to tell people they need help.

In december, I went to the er after trying to hurt myself by drinking and smoking till I blacked out. My mental health had been swiftly deteriorating before then, but this was the tipping point. I was incredibly suicidal and unstable after getting discharged from the er. I was picked up by a friend from this group, and I had been told by the crisis team psychiatrist that I most likely had bad. I am starting debt now. But that is besides the point word got to my friends about the bad stuff. When my mental health had deteriorated. My friends in this group said I could go to them for support and that I could talk to them when I was feeling down coming back from the hospital. Nobody except my roommates and one of my friends asked me if I was ok or reached out. Two of the friends in the group stopped responding to my texts and would not reach out. I spent weeks asking them if something was wrong, but they would not tell me. They say everything fine and I need to stop overthinking. I became really lonely and bitter. I thought they cared about me it february now, and after trying to get their attention and get involved in social stuff, I decided to take a step back from initiating and contacting people. Nobody invited me to hang out with them. The groupchat I am with them in has practically gone cold. Nobody asks how I am doing or ifI would be able to do something with them. I see them in class, and they do not speak to me. They re all doing stuff together. I know since the friend I am closest to is still hanging out with them, they would tell me to get help all the goddamn time when I was at my worst, and now that I am actually healing, they have no interest in maintaining the friendship. I cannot maintain it all on my own. It not fair. I am not so lonely anymore since I have accepted the whole thing and want to move on. I feel like they blame me for something, but I do not know what

I think its important to continually remind yourself that you are not at fault here. I definitely feel what you are going through. And I do not think this friendship group is healthy for you going forward. Try taking a step back and assessing what interests you or the hobbies you loved doing when you were younger. Just remember that you are worthy of having friends and deserve happiness daily.

Im sorry to hear about your friends when things get real like a hospitalization. Most people do not know how to react. It sounds like that friend group reacted with avoiding the issue. Youve done the work to try and reconnect, but it is not happening. If you are able, try joining a social group for a hobby your interested in, hopefully that will plant the seeds for new and better friendships. I am glad you are getting help, and I hope the people you keep around you are happy as well.

Those people are not friends good on you for realizing you are better of without them if you want to make new friends I suggest going to a place where you practice a hobby like a skate park and talk to some people maybe you will find a bud.

Title: I got scammed and it sucks that I cannot talk about.
Thread
I lost. It is no big deal. I know I can easily make that money back. Tldr I bought something that never came to meconfusion, but it is the feeling of guilt, shame, blame and depression that comes from it. I cannot talk about it with someone else, because I afraid they might think I stupid and change their entire perception of me. It sucks that this can happen to anyone. I used to judge people for being scammed like that and ultimately laugh at them. But after it happened to me, it just sucks. You know, like, how could I have not seen this? I am so dumb. I could not get over the fact that something so obvious could have ran past through me. It just sucks that this situation feels so lonely and isolated. You cannot really get up and talk to your family about it without getting judged. I guess I need some answers and help as to how I can move on from this feeling and how I can recover and ever trust again.

Weve all done things that we regretted after the fact or been in situations where it became obvious that we missed something glaring. Try to come to terms with the loss and what led to it take a few life lessons from it. You can apply in the future and try to put it behind you. I get back to your normal routine rather than continuing to dwell on what happenedconfusion. Good luck.

I live with my alcoholic brother for as long as I can remember I cannot really recall a single day in my life when I have not seen him drunk he does not acknowledge he is got the problem and he tells that he enjoys the lifestyle he has no matter how much I hate it nothing comes close to how much I hate the person it made me I became so judgemental of other people drinking habits I feel like I am more obsessed with alcohol than any of those I judge for drinking it I always feel super uncomfortable when my friends drink I cannot react to any drinking jokes normally I can even openly say I judge someone not fully realising what I am saying it like I do it unconsciously like some tiny part of myself I do not fully acknowledge wants everyone who ever thought alcohol was fun to suffer I would literally trade anything to be normal but every day is so hard I know that it is bullshit to think that everyone who drinks will end up like my brother but my brain cannot stop thinking that I feel the constant need to save everyone even while knowing it is useless and I feel so angry when I cannot save them it possible for me to spend hours talking how much I hate drinking culture and alcohol I would never let myself get drunk actually I feel so weak I know some people who also live confusion with anAlcoholic and nobody does the shit I do. They did not turn out completely fine, but none of them turned out like that. I feel like I am such a weak person, I cannot deal with life, and I also bring others down with me. I apologise to those around me on daily basis saying, how sorry I am for saying something hurtful again. I would trade anything not to be like that. I really do not know what to do, but I know I feel terrible. I do not understand what is with me.

Many alcoholics anonymous chapters also have a support group for family members of alcoholics I recommend finding one of those and attending.

Title: I think I have a toxic way of having a crush.
Thread
Hello, I am posting this message because I realise that my way of having crushes is very toxic, and I would like to know how to get rid of it. So what I do first is to feel a little attraction and ask myself the question of whether it is or not, when it clearly is. I will then question whether the person likes me or not. By observing them. While lying to myself about my own attraction, I will look for clues until I find the smallest thing which I will then interpret as the beginning of a green light. At that point, I will have a realization of, oh yeah, I definitely like her. I will then scrutinize the person actions even more in order to wring out the smallest sign I can find to their behaviour from the beginning. So once this is established, I enter the phase where one part of me will try to convince myself that she likes me by scrutinizing more and picking up and interpreting the few clues I find. And another part will use logical arguments to contradict me. These clues always have a rational explanation other than she likes me. This will go on until I get tired of listening to the illogical part until I get tired of the story. The illogical part will rely on hope to subsist. It is a fast eroding source in the long run, but slow to live. Each day. In this phase, I will watch the person every moveEvery glance and I will find it beautiful, of course, but from then on, I will be sad if the person does not talk to me, and I will be dissatisfied when he or she does talk to me, because I will constantly try to find things that will feed for a little longer. The embers of my hope, on which my feelings are desperately blowing, until inevitably it dies out. Imagination also plays a big part in this. The situations and scenarios I imagine that are based on an ideal help me to hold on to that crush. The process is always painful and tiring. I have noticed that I tend to assume that if the person has nothing basic, I cannot try anything. I am very afraid of rejection and lazy to process the emotions plus and minusconfusion that come with attraction. How can I get out of this toxic loop? And thank you very much.

Title: Why do so many people accuse self farmers of being attention whores
Thread
I know multiple people who have been bullied and screamed at for being attention whores since they self harmed and it just annoys the hell out of me that they would rather bully that person who self harms than reach out to them or offer them help
Comments
Hello, remarkable. First of all, im so sorry if you have experienced this first hand, I think scratch that. I know this is a huge problem in our society. People have a hard time understanding sometimes things that are out of their norm. Instead of trying to understand it, they write it off as a behavior that is done for extrinsic gain. Best thing to do is try to educate and support. And of course, validate those who are self harming that their thoughts are valid and encourage them to get help. Best wishes a friend and okay therapist.

I know it is sad because the people who need help do not get it. But literally in my friends elementary school, it was like a trend between everyone to have cut yourself. Numerous of the people from that school said they tried to during that period, some of them said they could not do it, and others said they did it because of people that are genuinely trying to be attention whores. But the majority of the people do not know how to tell the difference between the two. Even some of the people who are only doing it for attention also need help in their own way. Other times it is just to one up, their off, who is actually struggling

I find it very difficult to figure out when I am lying to myself I just really do not realize that I am not being honest with myself about how I feel. I do not realize I am lying to myself and do not know how I am not more conscious of that. I also do not know what to do about it any advice.

I have not been in one myself but it is understandable the way she is feeling psychs can be really traumatising for people and staff can sometimes be really unhelpful in addition some may feel like they have been abandoned by their family for being there is many things but ultimately there is so many things that can be making her angry in best thing is to give her some space but also ask occasionally if she would like some hugs and some time together and maybe then you could ask her why she is feeling the way she is

Title: How do people do
Thread
I feel trapped. I do not enjoy the world. I have my moments deadpool, quote, life is a series of train wrecks with brief, comical breaks of happiness. I want all of my life to change, but I cannot even get a different job to start. So that is very off putting to me anymore. I have hobbies, but even my hobbies have been putting me in a funk I can have a plan or goal to achieve on my hobby for the day. And it never happens, because with no exaggeration, something literally always goes south, and it takes longer, then it should. So I get pissy and moody. I really do not know what to do anymore. Everyone says, start by changing something small in your life. That is fine, but not enough to help me. The world is trash, and most people are trash, and I am supposed to somehow enjoy life as a happy panda and ignore all the shit constantly going on. I have stopped smoking weed and do a ir sauna. So those are some small things I accomplished. But god, I am no where close to enjoying life or being happy, I try to enjoy the moments and little things not good at it. I do not feel I am anywhere close to we are. I thought I would be at this point in my life. Your young, it is fine. Well, it is not fine. I am sick of it.

To be honest, my friend, I really feel you on this to coming from a messed up place where I can apply for so many jobs and get turned down over and over to trying to find friendships only to be shunned when you need help most. And after watching myself go from being on top of the world and an inspiration to a broken shadow of myself, I totally relate. And it is not like I fall and not try to get back as I have tried. But the loneliness and anxiety I live with just wreck me further to a point I pray I do not open my eyes the next morning sometimes as I just so tired of this. But the only that keeps me going is the hope that somehow I will get out of this position, and hopefully that I will find my redemption as I am only here for my mother and trust me, there are people that will feel it. If something happens to you, even me, as nobody deserves to suffer like this.

Title: My mother just slapped me in front of guests at my house.
Thread
I am and she just slapped my mouth in front of guests who are staying over my at house all because of house chores. She says, I do not help her, even though I helped her with literally everything when it comes to the house and cleaning. But according to her, she is still doing them chores at am while I was just in my room. And yes, I have been staying in my room quite a lot, because I have been felling depressed, but I have still been helping. We had a whole argument about house cleaning and chores, until she started to raise her voice at me and slapped me in my mouth while I was having dinner in front of other people. Is this okay? I am really frustrated and embarrassed. What would you recommend me

Is it real for sure it is wrong? Do you have someone to help you like a husband, boyfriend? Something like that? Its definitely wrong.

She can kick you out. But you must tell her to never slap you again and to please apologize, remind her of the work you do. The extreme is to file a report for domestic abuse. Perhaps it is time to leave it there somewhere you can.

Absolutely not okay I would honestly give her an ultimatum where she either changes her behaviour or is no longer a part of my life because that kind of shit is unacceptable and you should not have to put up with it just because shes your mother fuck blood relations who use their position in your life to abuse you

Title: Im having issues making friends.
Thread
Everyone in school is usually kind, only one boy who isnt. I want to be friends with them so badly, but I keep pushing away. When I have a chance, ive never felt so alone. I dont want to force anyone to be my friend. I used to never have issues making friends. Something just switched. Im confused and sad. I thought I was okay being aline until a group of kids talked to me. I noticed I enjoyed talking with them talking, as in they talk. I never answer. I know weird. I randomly became extremely anti social and pushed everyone away in, I think, december. I now talk to my dad and myself, and thats it. My worst, mentally, was december, and I had plenty of friends. This sucks

Talking to people is like dopamine, and you feel even worse when all of a sudden, people do not talk to you anymore, but people come and go. Sadly, I am sure there will more people out there for you to talk to and connect with.

Title: Only looking forward to things and not enjoying life.
Thread
I am currently unemployed and cannot work, and I feel like my mental health is just rapidly deteriorating. I cannot seem to live in the moment. The only thing that seems to bring me any joy is things that I can look forward to anytime I am not looking forward to something. All I want to do is just sleep until the time comes. I feel like it is so stupid, but I was supposed to get a package today that I was really looking forward to, and it got delayed because of snow, and now I just feel lost. Does anyone else understand this? I feel stupid for feeling this way, but I do not do anything else other than sit here. The game I play does not get a new doc until next week. I cannot drive. I cannot work. I just feel so boring.

I understand how you feel that happens with me too.

Title: Do I really need to go to a partial hospitalization program?
Thread
Years ago, I had a bad trip on weed, and it triggered intense feelings of derealization for me since then. I have been having extremely short, literally, like secondsconfusion, but almost daily episodes of feeling that derealization feeling nowadays, it is worst when I am trying to sleep. Il experience it really intensely and snap awake before trying to sleep again. The feeling that my surroundings, memories, or even myself, are not real, causes me to panic, and I am frequently tense, worrying that itl happen again. I have been prescribed a ton of meds throughout the past years, including ability for a few months and an entire year of taking klonopin. Currently, I am just taking buspar and elavil. I have been to different counselors since this all started. The klonopin did help, but I do not want to go back on it because of its dependency causing nature. My current counselor suggested I get assessed by a nearby mental hospital to see what they think I should do. Moving forward. Earlier today, I got assessed and they recommended a pop. I was surprised because that seems even more intense than an top. Fortunately, the pop is covered by my insurance. If I do decide to go, tldr is derealization, a worthy reason to do a partial hospitalization program.

Hey, if you check some of my posts, I have talked about how I got rid of my do, and it was very chronic and intense and took a lot of work. I personally think it is great that you can do a hospital programme. And derealisation is definitely a worthy reason. You might learn a lot of new ways to overcome it and learn to not be afraid of derealisation. I have done so much research on derealisation and depersonalization, and the main point that a lot of people speak of is acceptance. Once you start to accept the derealisation and not be scared of it slowly goes away. I would say I am fully recovered from it, but I do have my moments during the day where I think is this real, but I slowly draw myself back and just accept it. And then I proceed with my day. I think if you feel comfortable with doing the hospital programme, you should. It might really help

If it is covered, go a professional suggested it and did the research to figure out what route was most accessible to ensure more likely chance you go.

Title: I get weird behind the wheel.
Thread
Ow to work this morning, and I accidentally cut in front of some dickhead going way too fucking fast on the freeway, and he was pushed over to the side of the road. Eh my bad slow to down, he gets next to me, starts screaming, threats, idea what guy is saying? I scream out, pull over. I realized it was guys in the car. When I said it, I am alone. I am not pulling over laughing out loud, but I like to push the envelope. So I go to the freeway exit hes following hella fast, extremely close. So as I reach the exit, I go on my breaks a lil hard. He does not hit me but slows down. Im in the middle turning lane. He goes to the left of me and screams something to the effect of guess you do not want to fight pussy, ink. Why he thought that at this point. But I took it as his way of backing out again. I like to fuck with people. So I pulled behind him in his turning lane. He puts the car in park, gets out, and I realize it is some tiny, skinny jesse pinkman looking teenager. Hes puffing his chest out, yelling, throwing his arms, but I cannot hear him, because I am laughing so fucking hard. His dumbass is standing right in front of my. Ca if I actually felt threatened, I could have pinned him between our two cars. I just yell out, fuck you, bitch!Get back in your car as my car was shaking back and forth because of me throwing my body around from hysterically laughing. He gets back in his car. The light turns and we go. I decide imma follow him for a lil bit more. He decides to make a you turn, which was perfect for me, because that is the way I was originally going the whole time. The other teenagers in the car are yelling out the window about how they are going to fuck me up this and that we get stopped at a red light and he is yelling out his window. I continue to laugh at them and flip them off. The light changes, and the driver throws a plastic water bottle at my car. It boinks off the side with the most minimal force that made me giggle. Then the passenger behind the driver throws a water bottle. That boy threw the bottle straight at the pavement. The only thing in danger was that plastic bottle from getting run over by my tire, I roll my window down while howling, laughing and scream out, ahh! You missed, pussy! We both pull up to the turning light and it is red. I go next to him and just drive by him laughing at him. Were sitting at the light for about a minute. It changed. I made my turn and finished, getting to work! Am I an asshole for this? Yes. Was this stupid? Yes! Did I know if those teenagersHad a gun, no burnout, white teenagers that dress like that have something to prove to themselves. And their white homies easily could have got shot but it was a fun start to my day man shrugging.

Title: Can anybody tell me whether what I experience is a panic attack and if not, what is.
Thread
So this does not happen everyday. It happens in bursts. So for about a week, it will happen everyday, sometimes multiple times per day, but then it will stop happening for a few weeks. So I will feel the need to hold my breath. Then when I breathe again, I will feel sick to my stomach and have to keep swallowing saliva, which builds up in anticipation of puking. This is also accompanied by a horrible taste in my mouth, which only lasts a few seconds. And I will have a kind of spaced out feeling at the same time as the sicky feeling. I want to find out what exactly this is. This will happen at random times, so I might be at work, or I might be at home, lying in bed. Thanks, in advance

Personally, I think you should move. You re young, you can get a job overseas. There are lots usually teaching english or working on a cruise ship. You can escape your own shell redefine it. Or if you live in north america, you can escape with a more local job tree planting or the military, these may seem like odd suggestions, but if there is any element within you that is looking for salvation, this might be it. And I wonder if that is why you posted this, because you are subconscious, is holding onto that little bit of hope.

Title: Anxiety.
Thread
I have recently figured out that I also have seperation anxiety. I have finally found a significant other. And it is dawned on me that I get anxious every single time they leave unannounced or whenever we go home after hanging out. It not just I wonder where they went to and if they are safe well, it does start like that, but it eventually snowballs into panic. The other day I had been scared of them not showing up to where we usually hangout at. I texted them to confirm the time we set and they did not answer. This got the ball rolling. I tried to stop it, but soon enough, I would sent way too many texts to them, even tried calling whenever they do eventually come back. It is embarrassing, and they will not admit that it is annoying. Even worse is that I am scared that I am going to abuse them or something they ve been mentally abused beforeconfusion. I love them so much and I do not want to hurt them, but I cannot stop thinking about if I am hurting them and they are not saying anything, I know they are not the type to just sit there and take things, but you never know it? Really tiring, being so scared of harming someone when they have constantly reassured that you are not hurting them

And someone very close to them made a very mean comment about their weight to them. In private, the affected person has lost so much weight ever since. Its really sad. They have also become more quiet generally. Now I ask you reddit, how do you explain to the child that they are beautiful in their own way? How do you confront the person who said what they said to the child, and do you confront them in front of the child too?

The cause of your anger. If there is one is likely relevant, no particular reason trigger stressor, injustice, justice. People not meeting your expectations. Lack of control. Interpersonal difficulties.

Maybe it is that your subconscious feels like it is stuck in an infinite loop of life. I would recommend hunting for a new hobby and switching up daily routines, make plans to try new restaurants, look for new parks or attractions, to check out, fill your life with more unknowns and discovery.

How angry I am most days, some days are worse than others, but nothing causes it, cause it is the moment I wake up

Title: I am married and have zero friends. I do not trust anyone, and people usually just stress me out. Anyone relate.
Thread
The friends I did have moved. Now, I am just home alone, a lot doing schoolwork, my husband is around of the time, which has its pros and cons. I think we are a bit codependent, moreso than what would be considered normal. I just do not have the motivation to make friends or hold relationships. I want friendships, but at the same time, I don. I get very lonely, and in the past, people only ever made it worse. I am a former alcoholic and refuse to associate with people who drink. Often. I have ptsd anxiety disorder, agoraphobia and insomnia. I am much better than I was years ago, but it is still an everyday battle. I love people, but they disgust me too. It, like I have sides of the same coin fighting against each other all the time. I wish I knew how to break out of whatever it is I am keeping myself trapped in. I have been seeing a therapist for almost years. There been a lot of positive improvements. The pandemic did not help, and now I just do not have any motivation at all to leave my house, even though part of me really wants to. When I do go out, I cannot wait to get home. Ugh! It so frustrating it disappointing. I have also gained a ton of weight. I promised myself I would never get fat again yet. Here I am. I just wish I could be perfect at everything, but I seem to failAt everything like why.

Anyone relate? Yeah, the pandemic was rough on alot of folks. You will be good. Just reached out today. How long was it until you saw the positive improvement?

Title: I can eat very spicy food only when I am in a very bad mood.
Thread
Yesterday was terrible, likely one of the worst bad mood days I have had in years. I left work early in a tearful rage, went to the grocery store and bought a bunch of junk food. I ate of a bag of flaming hot chips. Last night today was a pretty great day. I get home and open that bag of chips start snacking, and my mouth is on fire. Usually, I can barely tolerate flaming hot chips. I figured since they were so tasty yesterday, maybe I got a weak bag, or my tolerance for spice went up. Nope. It seems that when I am so angry that I want to just cry, I can eat spicy food that I would never be able to eat otherwise. Now, I am super curious, almost looking forward to my next very bad mood day, so I can test this out. Has anyone else ever come across something like this before? I know that if I am in a bad mood, I tend to eat mindlessly trying to distract myself with that little boost you get from eating? I think next time I am in a very bad mood, I will try to eat increasingly spicy things as a means to distract myself from the bad mood. Instead of just mindlessly eating

I feel trapped. I do not enjoy the world. I have my moments deadpool, quote, life is a series of train wrecks with brief, comical breaks of happiness. I want all of my life to change, but I cannot even get a different job to start. So that is very off putting to me anymore. I have hobbies, but even my hobbies have been putting me in a funk I can have a plan or goal to achieve on my hobby for the day. And it never happens, because with no exaggeration, something literally always goes south, and it takes longer, then it should. So I get pissy and moody. I really do not know what to do anymore. Everyone says, start by changing something small in your life. That is fine, but not enough to help me. The world is trash, and most people are trash, and I am supposed to somehow enjoy life as a happy panda and ignore all the shit constantly going on. I have stopped smoking weed and do a ir sauna. So those are some small things I accomplished. But god, I am no where close to enjoying life or being happy, I try to enjoy the moments and little things not good at it. I do not feel I am anywhere close to we are. I thought I would be at this point in my life. Your young, it is fine. Well, it is not fine. I am sick of it.

I am much different than you in that I try to maintain my current lifestyle for the most part with adding the variation in overtime I guess it depends on temperament and what you want if what you feel like you are looking for is not where you are and want to change everything maybe starting from scratch elsewhere might be best save whatever money you can manage and just go play it by ear. I am sorry if it is not the best advise. It sounds like what you want to do to me even if it might fail. I think its better to try and fail than to just sit miserably

Its getting that evening time here that my mind starts racing and I become hypercritical of myself been in a rut since a very close friend died tragically months ago was isolating horribly and letting emotions drive me and reacting. Instead of accepting, I finally got a plan together to combat the isolation. Its working great and has broken the ice on the depression and anxiety a couple days ago on the was my years sober from alcohol, heavy drugs and cigs relapsed on the pot since my friend has been gone but managed to put a cork back in it, and now its been days free from that. Nights are hard, though I get lonely and my brain races come the morning, however, it resets, and since ive been working, my fight, isolation plan, the mornings and afternoons run fantastic. Thanks for your post. I need to socialize in the evenings when my mind gets race, and this helps me get it out of my system.

So since a long time ago I have been having this feeling of wanting to die at the beggining they re just thoughts, you know, just cause we think of doing it does not mean we are really going to do it right but lately I have been really thinking about doing it comes to a point where sometimes I am with a bunch of pills in my mouth or a blade next to my wrist I always stop I do not continue you know, I just spit the pills or pull the blade away at the decisive point I honestly do not know what is keeping me off doing this, I guess in the deep down, I do not want to die. I just want to believe that I will see the beauty of life again. I guess I just still have hope. And what I am most scared of is that someday I will loose completely my hope and actually do it a thing that I do not want, cause I know that the really me does not want that to happen. It came to a point where this is really hurting me, and I just need to talk to someone I know I need help. And I want to tell to my psychiatrist about this, but I do not know if, right after I say that to her, she is just going to admit me to the psyche ward. I am fuckin scared of that shit.

Yes, please tell them its ok to have thoughts unless you have a plan to do it now you will not get in trouble, I told my psychologist, and I am glad I did, because he gave me resources, and also told me I can send him a message if I feel that way again.

Which means I will never be able to make money to move out of my abusive fathers flat. Why dose shit! Never fucking work for me?

To be honest, my friend, I feel you on this to coming from being in a messed up place where even women spit in your face when you just want friendship. And after watching myself go from being on top of the world and an inspiration to a broken shadow of myself, I totally relate. And it is not like I fall and not try to get back as I have tried. But the loneliness and anxiety I live with just wreck me further to a point I pray I do not open my eyes the next morning sometimes as I just so tired of this. But the only that keeps me going is the hope that somehow I will get out of this position as I am only here for my mother and trust me, there are people that will feel it. If something happens to you, even me, as nobody deserves to suffer in this position

Title: Would you stay on a medication if it gave you facial tics?
Thread
Note, I have also been having occasional mild jerks in parts of my body, not sure if related, I had occasional very mild eyebrow twitches before starting lamictal. It would just happen a few times a year for, like a few days was never a daily thing, and it would not be there at all for most months of the year. It was very rare. After being on it, they got worse. And on my new dose confusion, they have literally been way more frequent, like, often times multiple times a minute, frequent for the majority or a large part of the day. Its annoying. Af and I literally have a wrinkle from it, even though im if I had money, I would just buy botox to stop the muscle, but I dont on. They had started to get a little bit better after a whiile, even though it was still a daily thing, which is, was not before the medicineconfusion. So yeah, ink would you stay on it if you had this? Basically, it is me putting my eyebrows up a lot. It is kind of embarassing. Lao I am afraid to try other meds because I value my sexual health too much. So I am in a bit of a pickle. Also, this started happening a month after starting the medication times a month again, not sure if related. And I am seeing a neurologist at the end of the month.

I was robbed of most of my childhood, but I feel more anger and determination to live as best as I possibly can, just to spite everyone, even if it is rage and hate motivating me. I will take it there still so fucking much out there, and I feel so fucking angry that I have not seen it yet. I want to see it, and I refuse to let anyone in my family stop me anymore. That being said, finding support groups would probably be extremely beneficial to you. Op unfortunately, a large majority of people who have never been through trauma are literally physically unable to understand and empathize completely. And so finding a group of survivors who have gone through the same thing that can understand, you will be huge in finding stability,

I am a lifelong adhd depressive with has at various times been complicated by ocd, anxiety and panic attacks by some miracle of circumstances. Im better now likewell adjusted andhappy somehow about a year ago, I hit the right mix of medication, meditation and therapy and everything started getting better. I was and still amconfusion improving faster than I ever dreamed possible. I found myself disengaging from support forums like this one. Then I thought about all the times I frantically scoured the web for support answers or hope, usually finding little of any. The singular thing I never found in those searches was a recovery story told by someone intimately familiar with the dark, horrifying throes of depression and anxiety by someone who knows exactly what it is like to want to end ones own life but managed not to and went on to claw their way back. A story told by someone who is recovering from mental illnesses but is choosing to stay engaged with those still suffering. Thats what I am hoping to offer in my blog hope to the legions of people out there who are still suffering in silence who are scouring the web right now for a familiar optimistic voice with a story that offers some hope that things can get better. I am offering the narrative of my unlikely recovery unedited, no script, no notes told in real time as it unfolds

Although I know almost nothing about you, I am willing to bet that things are not as bad as you think they are. Youre looking at things through depression glasses, which make everything look worse. When you recover, things will look very different. Problems that seemed hopeless will suddenly have obvious solutions. A lot of things can help standard treatments and the self help recommended by therapists. I have advice from experts in my comments, and you can click on my name and read. The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It very important to calm down. This will make you feel better, and let you think clearly, a very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical behavior therapy, which helps people who have bad, recommends this breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out and breathe seconds in breath and seconds out breath till you feel ok. Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down. Also, a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call

Do you want me to crack a joke or something? Do you want me to tell you a racist joke? Do you want me to comfort you? Tell you? It is gonne be fine. The thing is no one here knows how to help you which words should be spoken to keep you in this world. And the other thing is it is not going to be fine. You will die today or in years tommorow or at eternity end, dying is quick and easy. Anyone can do it. Sometimes it feels the only way to make your life to be in your hands to have control over anything to feel alive while dying. And this is the only way to have control to make a choice. We do not choose who we are. We do not choose our path. We do not choose our death time. But one thing we do control and this thing is very important, read, carefully. We choose how we react to life, what we do with it. And from our reaction, the path continues or ends today is the most important day in your life. All your life led to this moment. The february, this date is special for you. This date will forever be imprinted on your gravestone or your memory. The day you died or the day you converted your emotions into action. The day you emerged from the depths of the evil world. To look at it is surface. And when you did you realised it wasOnly you. It was all about you. This life is for you. There was no evil world. Things just happen your actions you blame yourself for. Were merely your misinterpreting or misunderstanding. The situation the life you hated so much could be so easily shaped into something beautiful and worth living. If only you turned your thoughts into action, an action made to keep the life keep on going to change your life, go do something if fail, try again. You do not have control of the consequences. But if you keep doing, you will overcome this state you are in. You will become the mountain able to stop the waves of the ocean do not end life today. Convert all the fucking shit you feel into action, and you will be indestructible.

Title: I hate to say it, but I hate myself.

Hi, everyone. This is a rant about my feelings, but I also really need advice, and just if anyone has suggestions for anything, it would be very much appreciated. I feel like my life is falling apart. I lost my job december, and I have had over interviews and applied to every job that I am qualified for, and I have still yet to receive an offer. I am dead broke. I cannot afford to eat. I luckily found some popcorn and ate that today. But I have been going days without eating. The whole job situation has definitely made my depression and anxiety so much worse on top of all that, I cannot help but feel like a waste of life and just extremely disgusted with myself and my existence. I know it will all get better. But each day, I keep feeling worse and worse. I am disgusted by my inability or lack of motivationconfusion to get anything done to improve my mental health. Even a tad, I gained labs out of no where, and I have not changed my eating habits. I ve really been eating less due to being brokeconfusion nor my activity level, which consists of basically walking my dog each day, my rooms a disaster, and my homes a mess. Anytime I attempt to clean up, I get overwhelmed and completely shut down. Theres so much more, but I did not want to ramble on. I do have a psychiatrist, but I also do not have money nor insurance toVisit I have past due bills with him as well. To whomever sees this. Thanks for reading. Does anyone have advice or tips to hopefully get things started in the right direction?

Title: Should I feel bad about rape and murder victims?

I just started noticing that after something happened a couple weeks agowink or smirk that I really could care less about people getting murdered and raped. And when I tired, justifying this in my head, I thought, well, people get murder and raped everyday. So people are probably used to this by now, confusion. When I was in school I asked people what their opinion on people getting raped stuff were, and apparently alot of people did care about it. Well, there is more to my story other than not caring about people being murdered and getting violated and stuff. And I just want to hear people thoughts on this goodbye

This could be stemming from your own trauma if you have ever had abandonment issues yourself, not saying you do at all just inquiring, because many with cptsd do not feel the need to care about others since they did not feel cared for themselves.

I find this disturbing to, say the least, its a complete lack of empathy for other people. You should definitely mention this to a therapist. Its one thing to not cry over strangers, but it is another thing to not care that it happens at all.

I live by the golden rule. If your loved ones were raped or murdered, would you like sympathy, empathy from strangers? If not, then your good, if you would want it, you should give.

I think it is normal to have detachment from issues that do not directly impact you or those you are close to feeling bad for something can mean a wide range of emotions from being really upset to having a general sense of sympathy where you feel it sucks that happened but you go on with your life and do not think about it again

I cannot tell if you are saying that if someone you knew told you they were raped that you would not care or you only do not care if it is someone you do not know.

Hello, reddit. I was a religious person. I was motivated, and even though I was pretty lazy, I could get myself up and running whenever I needed. After the lockdown, something changed, maybe because of having too much time inside and being around very annoying family members. I gradually started losing energy, and now I ve got to the point where I spend my days zoned out and try to sleep. As soon as I am home, I stay in bed the entire days, waiting for them to end. I struggle to wake up, and over all, I care less and less about consequences of slacking off. Last weeks, I lost interest in playing the piano, it my hobby. I am usually very passionate about itconfusion. I used to like to stay at home to read and watch stuff. Now I just want to stay in my room, alone, in the dark, hidden under the covers, this place of complete isolation and being invisible by everyone, brings me some kind of comfort, if I can call it. So coffee used to make me very restless and anxious. Now, drinking coffee helps me function. There is no apparent reason for this, and I do not feel sad, per se. I just have this feeling of apathy, but at the same time, anxiety, of letting my life go like this, I will fail my studies and everything. If this keeps on, what should I do?

A lot of people are complaining that it is hard to get therapy since the lockdown and you may want to look at online therapy and self help. What I usually tell people treatment usually begins by seeing the go, who can give you a referral? I mention referral, because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day. Any symptoms you might have, such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life affecting how you feel if you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lihelp with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also, traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this one practical advice for motivation. Very important

Loss of interest in things is a marker for depression. Do your meds need adjusting? Feeling better is something we deserve for ourselves. Don let yourself fade away.

Title: Extreme anxiety about going insane.

Hi. I experienced a drug induced psychosis about a month ago, and since then, I have struggled with intense anxiety and fear of going crazy it has taken over my life, and im scared almost all the time, sometimes distractions. As my family and boyfriend helps me get my mind off it. But its worse when im alone, and every night I have panic attacks, my brain keeps looking for signs and symptoms that im mad, and this has led me to feeling depressed and that there is no way out. I have even had the thought of ending it all, because its feels like an endless cycle. I wonder if someone has experienced something like this, or maybe if someone has som reassurance, please dont say something that can make my anxiety worseconfusion.

I want to share some information about anxiety, but first, this panic disorder often responds to self help. In fact, handbook of self help therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that is most responsive to self help details here, self help and standard treatments. Anxiety puts scary thoughts in our minds. For example, a fear of going crazy there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it, think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings, and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication. Don overlook stress management. It can help even with very bad anxiety.Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy cbtconfusion than with medicine and some are successful with self help based on cut I can show you some cut self help but first I want to say that recently there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing video a lot of helpful information, including the part program of brown and gerbarg.

Jamie foxx, the actor actually had the same thing happen to him at a party when he was younger. Someone spiked his drink with psychedelic drugs and caused him to suffer a psychotic break. He talked about it in interviews when he was doing that movie. The soloist about schizophrenic musical prodigy nathaniel ayers. He said, doing that movie brought up old anxieties about what happened to him, but he got help and recovered. You can recover too.

I feel really bad about what happened. I was at a queer poetry writing event. Everything was good, but I was really anxious about everything there were like people, so it was supposed to be pretty chill, but I was overthinking what they think about me my writings and I just couldnt focus on the task. And suddenly I did not know what is going on. I went to the bathroom, I was breathing really fast. I felt pain in my chest. I was shaking, and I felt like my heart is going to explode. And I was having a hard time talking myself out of panic and to breathe normally. And then someone came check on me, but I said, I am okay and they left. I think I missed around half an hour of workshop. I am so embarrassed. Cuz I just left the place and was in the bathroom for around half an hour. Then most people left, so I had to go to. I left and did not really told them what happened. I feel so bad about it. I feel like I destroyed everything I should just take my shit together and continue with workshop. I feel really ashamed and will never go back to that place. I hope I never see this people again. Sorry. I had to let it out. Sorry for my bad english

Title: I confusion failed my driver test and am an anxious and empty wreck I guess
Thread
So I have always been struggling with mood swings. It like when something bad happens, I am extremely devastated and sometimes even suicidal. And when something good happens to me, I am super euphoric and feel on top of the world. I guess that has never been a problem until I failed my first driving test and fell into a huge hole. The problem now is also that I feel super anxious all the time I feel like throwing up and my stomach feels light. The second I wake up, I did fail that driving test because I panicked and did something stupid, and that nervousness stayed with me. I cannot seem to relax anymore. I tried taking some over the counter medication for anxiety, but they will not work, or they make me unable to concentrate. Also, I am too anxious to go to my late therapist for medication because she always acts like I am faking. At least it is always a pain in the ass to talk to her

You can go to the websites with advice for test anxiety and see what they have in common. A number of them recommend breathing slowly in case of panic. And this is very useful for treating anxiety.

So I have always been struggling with mood swings. It like when something bad happens, I am extremely devastated and sometimes even suicidal. And when something good happens to me, I am super euphoric and feel on top of the world. I guess that has never been a problem until I failed my first driving test and fell into a huge hole. The problem now is also that I feel super anxious all the time I feel like throwing up and my stomach feels light. The second I wake up, I did fail that driving test because I panicked and did something stupid, and that nervousness stayed with me. I cannot seem to relax anymore. I tried taking some over the counter medication for anxiety, but they will not work, or they make me unable to concentrate. Also, I am too anxious to go to my late therapist for medication because she always acts like I am faking. At least it is always a pain in the ass to talk to her

Title: I am worried you are not real.
Thread
That I am not real, not like I thought I was. And something else is going on just almost beyond the limits of my ability to conceive its in mornings and nights waking or drifting to sleep. These thoughts come. Its like the normal lines are not as solid. I see peoples faces in my mind, and I cannot always give them the credit that I used to. I had a dream. I started to wake up and it was hard to have to accept my family were imaginary. But always here with me now is the knowledge that my life is meaningless. Some peoples lifes matter, and the world would be worse without them. I missed my chance to try to do anything important, but I also never lived like I wanted when it was still an interesting thing. I am just waiting all the time, usually in silence. I go doing daily tasks, and the days are the same day, almost over and over. It feels already sometimes that this is it. This is the void and the nothing, and these are the effects that happen in it. And they are insubstantial in a way I wish I had realised the silence of it sooner. I do not know who or what ai am and I have lost my place in the world, and everything I held on to I am scared to die. I am scared to wake up. Tell me I am delusional.

You have a lot of thinking power being a compulsive thinker is as unwelcome today as it is needed in the future. Laughing big grin or laugh with glasses. One could argue that nothing matters in billion years our sun shall turn supernova. Nothing no one shall ever even have known we existed. You can rely on one thing though science happy face smiley I used to be a mess without a new value system.

Yes, these are delusions that is ok when we have issues with mental health disordered, thinking is expected when I share these kinds of thoughts with my care providers they make sure I know these thoughts are symptoms and we are not our symptoms you are doing the best you can things always change. Now please tell me the same thing because I totally believe this about you me not so much.

Check out cognitive behavioral therapy to deal with your issues like you feel like the external world is a figment of your imagination. Do you have any proof? How do you know you are not the figment of someone else imagination? My point is, you may not have proof you are wrong, but you do not have proof you are right either. Think about it.

Title: Confusion I fucked up my life.
Thread
I here I moved across the country to wyoming, from florida with my boyfriend, confusion, who I was not even with for a year yet stupid. I know I quit my job that I loved. I left the place I called home and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. Things are not going smoothly. Its the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues. Communication has gotten the worst it is ever been minor, but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me he would be better about lack of trust in him due to his lies baggage on his end, causing major strain between the two of us mother in law, exesconfusion. I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end, since I quit my well paying job in florida to come here. My credit cards have not gotten paid since november and my bank account is, he told me he was going to take care of me financially. He hasnt. I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in florida for years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings were not reliant upon some guy I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced bed bath apartment back in florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now I threw away everything I valued andLoved about my life for some guy that cannot even be honest with me on a consistent basis for a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me for a guy who just does not understand me, even though he likes to act like he does, I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid. And you want to know what the worst part is. I do not think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make a month now I am not only broke I am in severe debt now things will never be the same because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was. I guess I cannot even do that, right? I am quite literally good for nothing. I should have done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. I do not even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I cannot even be mad at him. I did it to myself.

Damn I do not think this makes you stupid. You took a chance when we have feelings for someone we kind of get blinded to alot of things. Its ok. You are not dumb. Clearly, what is happening now is not it for you, though, do not be indecisive. You need to make a decision and get out of this situation. You could ask to go stay with a friend or parents. If that is an option to get yourself straight, youre making this out to be the end of the world. But it is not. You can get your life back in order, no doubt focus on solutions and not the problems

To be honest my friend I feel you on this to coming from a messed up place where people just spit in your face when you just want friendship and after watching myself go from being on top of the world and an inspiration to a broken shadow of myself that I really wish I could do something to avoid ever seeing myself get into this position so yeah I totally relate and it is not like I fall and not try to get back as I have tried but the loneliness and anxiety I live with just wreck me further to a point I pray I do not open my eyes the next morning sometimes as I just so tired of this but the only that keeps me going is the hope that somehow I will get out of this position as I am only here for my mother and trust me there are people that will feel it if something happens to you, even me as nobody deserves to suffer like this especially when they just want a chance to make memories

Hi, everyone. This is a rant about my feelings, but I also really need advice, and just if anyone has suggestions for anything, it would be very much appreciated. I feel like my life is falling apart. I lost my job december, and I have had over interviews and applied to every job that I am qualified for, and I have still yet to receive an offer. I am dead broke. I cannot afford to eat. I luckily found some popcorn and ate that today. But I have been going days without eating. The whole job situation has definitely made my depression and anxiety so much worse on top of all that, I cannot help but feel like a waste of life and just extremely disgusted with myself and my existence. I know it will all get better. But each day, I keep feeling worse and worse. I am disgusted by my inability or lack of motivationconfusion to get anything done to improve my mental health. Even a tad, I gained labs out of no where, and I have not changed my eating habits. I ve really been eating less due to being brokeconfusion nor my activity level, which consists of basically walking my dog each day, my rooms a disaster, and my homes a mess. Anytime I attempt to clean up, I get overwhelmed and completely shut down. Theres so much more, but I did not want to ramble on. I do have a psychiatrist, but I also do not have money nor insurance toVisit I have past due bills with him as well. To whomever sees this. Thanks for reading. Does anyone have advice or tips to hopefully get things started in the right direction?

Step increase your monthly earnings is not enough a month, get a job as a caregiver and make dollars an hour at least at hours a week that a month after taxes, depending on taxesconfusion, donate plasma you can get your first month at biolife. If you can get there note I checked indeed. And there are plenty of caregiver jobs in wyoming, there always are very likely near. You do not need any prior medical experience or education, just no history of abuse or convictions as well as patience while you wait. You can also apply for welfare and get weekly checks that are about of your paychecks from you previous job since you have worked the last year or so you may need to go to your local library for a computer, but this is fairly easy step. I do not know what your expenses are currently, but if you absolutely need to move somewhere else, you can try find a room and live with another female, if needed mental health stuff. Look, we are strangers on the internet. We cannot save you. We cannot do all that much for you, though we would like to. You know, you messed up somewhere along the way. Many timesconfusion, you have the best insight on the problems. Maybe consider working with a good therapist on this for a while. Once you have finances, figured out, see, aboveconfusion, and or you can journal, care for a dog, meditate, read books or do whatever it takes experiment withThisconfusion to improve your life and mental well being as a fellow sojourner on the earth, good luck.

I would definitely look at what bills are most important electric, rent water, then, if you have a car or other loans, next amenities, netflix, etc. Then the bills to hospitals and other places as far as I know, you can pay as little as you want, over as long as you want. So stress over those last, if you have large credit card debt, look into consolidating it as far as your food. Look into food banks and shelters, they offer you a giant cart of food once and month, and you can go to multiples. They give you more food than person could ever possibly eat. You do not have to qualify for win, eat or any other service to go to a food closet. Eating healthy is important for our rest strength and mental health, for exercise. Just try walking on a nice day for jobs, maybe for the time being, take something beneath you, work at a retail store or mcdonald, while still applying for what you really want to do. Its possible they need people so badly right now, you could move up quickly in one of these places. If you have a degree and are older and experienced, the pay is not bad. As a manager at a fast food place, its just not the most fun work. Good luck with getting good mental health care, they just do not offer it free. Looking into medicaid, and medicare is, of course, an option, but it takes time. Make a listOf what needs to get done, what you want to get done long term or daily or weekly, etc. It will put things into perspective and feel good when you get to mark things off smiling face with open hands.

Title: Why does talking feel extremely difficult after every minor issue?
Thread
This started probably about a year ago, but until recently, it has not been impacting my life after even the smallest little thing happens, it feels like my head is about to blow up, just saying one word it like, in the morning, when your alarm is ringing and you would do anything in the entire world to just snooze a little longer. Talking is not actually physically difficult. I still have my voice and my ability. It just feels indescribably draining, like I would rather die than saying a simple yes or no. Amp why is this happening? It been coming in the way of my wellbeing and daily life, and usually happens multiple times a day.

Title: I need a new psych.
Thread
So apologies in advanced for poor formatting I am ranting so I just got off a zoom meeting with my psych first thing I tell her I am having stomach issues could be an ulcer I had an ultrasound done yesterday waiting for resultsconfusion and she goes ok so what can you eat I go not much I cannot eat dairy I had a banana this morning and that hurt too so im not sure I then tell her what I went through on monday night wasnt pretty was curled up in a ball from pain almost in tearsconfusion and without skipping a beat she goes oh well why are you having dairy anyway dont you know if you eat or drink dairy products it could give you cancer pimples stuff like that which immediately threw me off she dismissed my stomach problem and went on to my mental health so I tell her its good I had a couple rough days but I got through them and then she immediately checks for my and vitamin and says they are both low and wants me to take supplements for both even tho. I told her, vitamin keeps me up at night even if I take it in the morningconfusion. And she makes me go upstairs grab both bottles I have show her and she suggested I take the smaller bottle just try it. She says ok so then she says you know, I always wonder what people are doing when it comes to low like iAm wondering if your mom is not cooking good food for you. Okay, I want to talk to your mom about good food, diets for you. So basically she thinks my mom is not giving me good enough nutrients in my food, even though I am fucking years old and can make my own decisions. Oh, this is fun too. My mom runs a daycare. I kind of help. I have helped more in the past, but am unable due to my stomachconfusion. And she is basically busy from am til about monday, friday. My psych goes, well, when is your mom free? I tell her what I have written above. Well, I do not work after, so I cannot do that. Okay, so let us see when school is off, so she can come. I go, no, she has kids below the school age, and she says, oh, okay, but last time your mom was able to come to the meeting and I go, yeah, because she booked it off, she has to book it off a year in advanced. Oh, okay, so what time is best for your mom? I go, well, quiet time is between and an she goes, okay, well, let us book an appointment for. I am pretty sure you can handle the kids while they are eating. Right? I was stunned. I was so pissed I could not talk. I just agreed to whatever she was saying, il only take like, minutes of her time. Yeah, okay, you say, theAppointment is for but in reality it is going to be either or because you do not know how to fucking space your time out she gives other people more time than me I think I only get a half hour every month and she is always late so ink its going to be a shit show for the next couple months with this going and my stomach ink if this is the right place for this but I am just pissed

Title: I feel like im having an oddly difficult time right now and I dont know what to.
Thread
Hey, all this is going to be kind of all over the place so ill put a tldr, but still lets get into it. Currently ive had a really wierd start to the year. The past year, ive been working at home before I go to law school. Its been difficult, but im fairly happy with my options but still definately a stressor. My work is fairly mundane. I dont do alot, and it isnt very rewarding, but still, its a job and im pretty okay with it. I also coach a sports team which takes up quite a bit of time as well. My girlfriend and I are long distance, so im pretty alone. I started the new year working from home, which I enjoyed. I felt like I could do things finally in my down time and I really enjoyed it. Sadly, I had to go back into the office, which has been really annoying. Late in january, I got couid, and ever since ive just felt tired, I have had a tough caffeine addiction for a few years, but no amount really gets me up and going, ive neglected cleaning for the past few weeks and my car is kind of a wreck at work. Im really struggling to stay on task. Even the boring tasks feel like they are so annoying. When I get done with practice, its like clock and im just tired. I dont want to clean. I dont want to do laundry. I just want to play video games.For an hour and sleep im not on any anti depressants or anything. I dont know if this is seasonal depression or what, but im just not right. I feel off. I feel tired. I feel like I could sleep forever and still be tired like ink if im streched to thin or what but does anyone have advice? Tldr I feel incredibly down recently and its taken a tole on my ability to work and perform. I need help on how to deal.

Title: Vent rant
Thread
So for context, I am and female. When I was younger, my parents got divorced as my dad cheated on my mum whilst she had cancer, which caused my mum to be mentally unstable. I also went to foster care for abuse, and I have many mental health issues. I moved away to boarding school to get away, but I keep getting depressive episodes, and I am not happy with my life, and I am uncomfortable with everything, and I hate the fact that I am growing. As everything I do feels gross. I oversexualize myself, and I just regret everything I have done. I regret ever existing, and I feel so stupid, but my emotions change so fast, and I do not know what to do. I feel discussing in my own skin, and I just hate everything. I do not want to grow any taller, and I just want to be the small, innocent child I once was, because now I am a messed up person, and I am only I know I am young and it hurts so bad because I am going to have to live the rest of my life. I have tried to overdose, and I have had a self harming problem that I am clean from, but nothing feels good, and I am overall uncomfy in my own skin. If anyone has advice or has anything to say, I would be grateful. Thank you.

Title: Why cannot I stay clean?
Thread
To self harm for the past few days, I have not been able to stay clean for more than a day. I do not know why I keep hurting myself. I just do. I know I need to stop, but for whatever reason I can I feel slightly disappointed in myself after doing it, but that disappointment does not stop me. My boyfriend got me these elbow length gloves for my birthday, which I am very thankful for. Obvious reasons. I have been wearing them non stop since he gave them to me. Hopefully no one will question why
Comments
I get it is extra hard to stay clean because you probably were doing it for a long time and it became your cooping mechanism and that is why it is hard to stop but also so is pretty addictive. You should try to find something that gives you the same effect. Maybe try reaching out to someone when you feel like doing it or take a cold shower instead, maybe squire some ice cubes or just do something stupid like make yourself a tea when you feel like. So I know it is hard, but I believe that you can do it stay strong and remember it is okay to maybe start therapy because it can help a lot

My boyfriend got me these elbow length gloves for my birthday, which I am very thankful for. Obvious reasons. I have been wearing them non stop since he gave them to me. Hopefully no one will question why

Title: I experienced something traumatic last night, and I do not know how to cope.
Thread
Last night, my confusion, best friends mother sent me a message asking me to look after her kids because she could not take it anymore. Immediately, alarm bells went off in my head because she has attempted to take her life before, and she is been dealing with a lot of unfortunate events. As of late, I knew what she was planning and felt ill. I called my best friend and told her to stay with her mom, but she informed she had left the house. I quickly informed her of what she had sent me so she could call the police and quickly hung up so I could try and talk her down. We went back and forth for about an hour of me trying to talk her out it all while crying and hyperventilating. But nothing I said seemed to work. Shes bipolar and can have fits of mania where she will not listen to any kind of logic, and I am pretty sure she is been off her meds. Thankfully, I did finally get her to tell me where she was and called the police. They were able to get to her in no time. I know that this is not going to be the end of the problem, and I am so glad she is ok, but I am still beyond strung out. I cannot stop thinking about it, and I have been in tears all day while fighting off panic attacks. I even had extreme nightmares last night. The only thingI could think of at the time was I cannot let my best friend lose her mom. She needs her, and if she died, it was going to be my fault. I am also very close to the family, because I have known them since the first grade. She is like a mom to me, too. I feel like shit, because they are the victims, but I am so shaken up by it all. I would not dare to confide in my friend because I want to be strong for her. She needs someone to be by her side right now. But I have no one else to talk to about it. I do not want to talk to my other friends either, because I feel like I am putting their business out there. I do not know what to do or how to get rid of this horrible, sinking feeling that is been weighing on me all night and morning.

It totally normal to be shaken up by a scary event like this give yourself a couple of days to process and recover and then try your best to start to get back into your normal routine even if it does not feel normal initially but it can and hopefully will in short order and if you need to set some limits boundaries with this friend for your own well being please do so without guilt hang in there and hope things get better soon.

Title: It so hard to study.
Thread
College student in stem here, and I am so close to drop out. I swear to god, waking up to attend classes is such a chore doing all these assignments, lab reports, essays, webinars and with a nice serving of household responsibilities. From my mother, my professors are so inconsiderate, too. With deadlines and demanding for quality outputs, exams are coming up, and I cannot even open my goddamn laptop without my eye straining and a pounding to head. Maybe the problem is, I do not have someone to talk to my blockmates all have their own shit. My friends have their own shit. Honestly, I am trying really the other day I had an anxiety attack, because my prof told me to redo all my work. I spent a whole day working on itconfusion, and now I cannot even check on my emails or notifications without my chest squeezing and my gut giving me actual pain. Breathing exercises did not work. Took a day off, my socials, tried to go for a walk, even watched a slice of life movie. But I just cannot seem to bring myself up to study again.

Sounds like a very stressful, counter productive environment. Old chap you are being very hard on yourself following the examples of potential lesser men slow learners as they would have, you believe, are just people who prefer, instead to take the time to understand the details at a pace which encourages the best circumstances for learning. Studies laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses. The pressure isolation are working in tandem to produce an undesired effect I understand, wink or smirk. Passion inspiration cannot be forced but can be encouraged. I cannot tell you who to look up to you know yourself best. And any suggestions I may present to you would only be seen as a chore also in your current state of mind. You have to think back to what made you want to learn about what nature tells us.

So I promised myself I really give this next course, my all, which I did and it still did not work now I physically cannot get out of bed before am, and I have completely isolated myself and given up on my future, watching everything crash and burn do not even know what day it is.

You are in total fight or flight mode. Make a plan on how you want to manage all the workload, write out every single detail, including breaks, wake up time and sleeptimeconfusion, and then stick to it. No matter what. Stick to this plan, and make a realistic plan do not put in too much because you will feel overwhelmed again. If you put in too muchconfusion and prioritise don try to make everything perfect. Just put in the bare minimum you must do and do only that ever heard of the rule put in of work, achieve of the outcome. But it is up to you to identify the crucial wish you all the best you can do.

Same bro. My teachers expect so much and care so little for the mental health of their students. What are you studying? Unsolicited advice? If your friends are real ones, they will listen to your shit. It feels like everyone always has something going on. So if you wait for the right moment, it might never come. And in the worst case, it could be too late. Open up if you feel safe in doing so, if you feel like you can writing it down on paper, laughing out loud, not your laptopconfusion can help. And later down the line, you could show it to someone you trust. Instead of telling them it easier. Good luck with your classes, sleep, drink, water, eat. It will not fix it. But it always surprises me how much better I feel after I actually get eight hours

Title: My mind keeps feeling dark.
Thread
Yesterday I was on a high. I felt like I could do anything I was innovating, not sure the term for when you discover how to improve somethingconfusion, doing all my usual hobbies with no worry in the world. And today, I sort of started my day with it, but it has since faded. My mind just keeps focusing on dark thoughts, not depression or suicide, although I do apparently have complex ptsd. But I get into this state where the world around me feels dark and there is nothing I can look to for hope or really feel good about anything. I need help with this because it makes my mood just plummet on top of that, it can trigger anxiety attacks, because the dark thoughts often make me jump towards someone ideas that would create worry for me, like, for example, my pa just suddenly dying on me now and not having anything to do to pass the time whilst I wait to get my pa fixed that. And even when I am on my highs, I get this sickly feeling it will never last forever. And I am right. It lasted until today. I always have to keep in mind when I feel that good that there is something I need to keep repeating in my head, I not allowed nice things, and I not allowed to be happy. Amp almost forgot to mention I have high functioning autism as well. If that relates to this in anyway, I really need help. IWant to stop feeling this way. It might be depression, but I have never known it to do this. I have always sort of had things to look forward to before, and I cannot use anti depressants because it kills one part of my life that I cannot live without.

Title: Underrated wellness resources.
Thread
Just wanted to share some underrated resources that I have been using to support my mental wellness in my day to day life, I have separated them into three categories. I thought this could help others as well. Mental wellness a great resource with different activities and resources for all topics centered around mental health. One of my favorite resources on their website is the one to achieve better sleep quality. A community based mental health website which gives members support through articles and an interactive question and answer component as well. This website acts as a virtual support group for people with a range of issues. Each individual gets a tribe where they are able to receive support from individuals going through similar problems. My favorite mental health blog, with tips and news on every mental health topic you can think of. I also enjoy doing their quizzes. Each article is written and reviewed by mental health professionals. This is something my friend just made, and it is very new, so they would appreciate any feedback you may haveconfusion. But basically, this is a text based service, which is great because I do not have to download anything, which is a huge pro for me, because I already have so many apps on my phone, I get reminders for all things wellness, such as water breaks and exercise prompts. Theres a waitlist right now for the app, but I have linked the page in case this is of interest, physical wellness, an all in oneResource for yoga youre able to find search poses, routines and meditation. A blog, structured website with resources and information on healthy eating, beauty, lifestyle and health. This is great to look up quick recipes or product recommendations, free workout program for all target areas and ages without the need for any equipment. If you follow her other social media. She also has great recipes for overall great physical health. A blog with posts on nutrition, workouts, health and eating disorders wellness at work.

There are so many factors to this I tried to kill myself in may of I love everything about my life now and am thankful everyday. My attempt was unsuccessful, but I have different and much better supports. Now I had the most amazing therapist I saw for years, and she is the woman I want to become I lost every single friend in and rediscovered myself. I got accidentally pregnant in and had my child in and my son is my savior everyday. I live and make everything worth it because of him. I have a great partner and my siblings and I relationship have gotten so much better through the years I used to hate my dad. I cannot imagine my life without him. Now, life takes time. It is shitty and hard and stupid and something it feels like it is not worth it. I cannot promise you anything, but I do think it gets better. Please reach out to anyone you feel comfortable, even my messages are open. I have been where you are for a long time. I know how heartbreaking and draining it is just know, even if you do not feel it, the world is a much better place with you here,

Title: Going to meet a therapist soon. What to say and not to say to a therapist.

So I have adhd and depression but have never been clinically diagnosed I have finally an in person meeting scheduled with a therapist counsellor in a week I had one online session but the person told me to meet someone in person and also try to get an appointment with a clinical psychiatrist because only they can prescribe medication however I am quite anxious and wondering what to say or not to say in an in person meeting I have had my share of making a bad impression on the first meeting in my personal and professional and I do not want to make it worse also what should I need to mention to clearly describe my situation I would be grateful for every suggestion and thank you in advance
Comments
First do not worry about making a bad impression they are not there to judge you they will not drop you if they think you are too boring, weird etc the only way to make a therapist not like you is to be rude to them in general do not hold back. Tell them all of your most personal thoughts share everything the more they know, the more they can help. It is however important for you to understand mandatory reporting a duty to report confusion laws in your jurisdiction. If you give them reason to suspect you are an immediate harm to yourself or others, they must report this to the police generally something like last night I thought about suicide is not enough, but I want to do it right now or I thinking about doing it as soon as I get home will cause them to report

Title: Ex husband prioritized prioritizes random things why
Thread
Basically, one of the many reasons our marriage did not work out was that he prioritized a discord group over the marriage, which is eccentric. He recently emailed me on our former wedding anniversary. He said he really missed me. He then gave me a macaroni and cheese recipe. He thought I would like I do not think it is a joke. I really feel like his thinking is this disordered? There are many other such instances. Does this sound more like substance abuse or psychosis or something else?

Was that he prioritized a discord group over the marriage. Lots of people prioritize other things over a marriage, a job, working out family friends, hobbies, etc. Sometimes the spouse may understand I making money is important, but work is not the goal of lifeconfusion, but still be upset. And sometimes the spouse will he bewildered? Since it does not align with their own interests needs, he said he really missed me. He then gave me a macaroni and cheese recipe he thought I would like. Sounds like he was trying to be genuine and thoughtful, but perhaps you two do not really sync up in terms of what each person finds important perspectives on life approaches to communication, etc. Rather than it being influenced by mental health. It pretty common for relationships to not work out for reasons like this, and nobody would be to blame, wishing you both well for future relationships.

Title: Why does talking feel extremely difficult after every minor issue?
Thread
This started probably about a year ago, but until recently, it has not been impacting my life after even the smallest little thing happens, it feels like my head is about to blow up, just saying one word it like, in the morning, when your alarm is ringing and you would do anything in the entire world to just snooze a little longer. Talking is not actually physically difficult. I still have my voice and my ability. It just feels indescribably draining, like I would rather die than saying a simple yes or no. Amp why is this happening? It been coming in the way of my wellbeing and daily life, and usually happens multiple times a day.

Hi I do not even know how to start this I in highschool and my mental health is something I ve been struggling with for so long and it is becoming so overwhelming I have missed over days of school this year alone I have not been to school since I was in the gradeconfusion this is my first year trying to start attending and well it is just so bad I cannot go more than days a week and when I do I do not go for two weeks after that but that is not really what im here to vent about last year around may I picked up a bad drinking habit. I drank in my room alone about every night until I did something bad to myself under the influence around the end of late november so my parents found out and hid all alcohol nowadays I eat until I make myself sick or physically harm myself. Recently, I was taken out of therapy because the company said my attendance was horrible and that I didnt talk about how I felt enough, which I personally think I did try my best to communicate, and I felt like I was doing good, especially thinking about the fact that they changed my therapist every months. But not only that they were saying how people do not need therapy forever, and that I should just take a break. But besides all that my parents refuse to take my alcohol situation seriously, they really do not thinkIt was a problem, but I personally can see how much of a problem it is, especially now because it is all I think about, and I am turning to any form of self harm to try and help the craving for alcohol. I struggling now more than ever, even though ive been feeling these things since the age of I just so lost, I feel so alone. I so mean to people like my boyfriend constantly. And to be honest, besides him, I have like other friend, and I just have no one. I am so incredibly lost. I dont know what my next step should be. Im hurting really bad and everyone is failing to listen.

Instead of thinking about the negatives of your life, think of the positives, small as they may be, they are worth holding on to and stop talking to yourselfhappy face or smiley not in a bad way, but we are our own worst enemiesfrown sad, angry or pouting you got this and go to school.

Title: Confusion I fucked up my life.
Thread
I here I moved across the country to wyoming, from florida with my boyfriend, confusion, who I was not even with for a year yet stupid. I know I quit my job that I loved. I left the place I called home and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. Things are not going smoothly. Its the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues. Communication has gotten the worst it is ever been minor, but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me he would be better about lack of trust in him due to his lies baggage on his end, causing major strain between the two of us mother in law, exesconfusion. I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end, since I quit my well paying job in florida to come here. My credit cards have not gotten paid since november and my bank account is, he told me he was going to take care of me financially. He hasnt. I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in florida for years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings were not reliant upon some guy I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced bed bath apartment back in florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now I threw away everything I valued andLoved about my life for some guy that cannot even be honest with me on a consistent basis for a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me for a guy who just does not understand me, even though he likes to act like he does, I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid. And you want to know what the worst part is. I do not think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make a month now I am not only broke I am in severe debt now things will never be the same because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was. I guess I cannot even do that, right? I am quite literally good for nothing. I should have done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. I do not even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I cannot even be mad at him. I did it to myself.

Get out of the situation you are in. That guy is a royal jerk, and you are going to keep waiting for him to be responsible, and it does not seem like it will happen. You can always start over again, crash on some couches of friends until you can get yourself a place and take care of the debt. Move back to florida, if that is where your friends are, return to the job you loved, and if they are not hiring, find another job that will get you to be stable again. If no friends to stay with and no way to move back, then see if anyone needs a roommate, save your money as much as you can, and you will be able to support yourself again. Take a deep breath and decide on the direction you want to have for your life and take the step towards it may be hard and a massive challenge and undertaking, but you can achieve it. We are all rooting for you to get back onto your feet again.

Are you going to try to stay and work things out? Try to move back to fly or try something else? I think that is the first question.

Title: People ignore me all the time and I do not know why.
Thread
I cut to the chase. No matter what I do, I feel like I simply do not exist to other people, at least in my head. That is how it looks like. But I honestly think I have good reasons to believe that I am not counting in real life interactions with my family, for example, because that is different. But whenever I try to connect with anyone through the internet discord or phone, this is more or less what happens on a daily basis. People I call friends, people I know since childhood, they either never respond to my phone messages or they respond after a very long time days, even, and the answer is often just the most basic, bland reply you can imagine. It feels like it is written in a very dismissive manner. This I can somewhat understand, because people have their own lives, they are not always glued to their phones, etc. I feel like this is pretty normal confusion. Talking to people on discord, people I know from the internet, even if pinged and they are active, they completely ignore my message and continue talking about the same topic or about something else. It, like my message never appeared on their screens. Sometimes, even if I try to casually add something to the conversation, the entire conversation stops on the spot. If that happened once or twice. Sure, I would not mind. But this literally happens, like of the time I write anything, it simply feels abnormal, like it shouldNot happen not that often, posts on social media or forums are no different. It got so bad that I genuinely believe this post itself will be ignored, too. I expect that to happen. I already wrote a similar post on another subreddit about mental health. It was about being ignored. Lo and behold, it was ignored, too, only reaffirming my worries. I see other posts getting massive amounts of interactions and upvotes on that same subreddit, and my post just went unnoticed it, like it never existed. And it happens all the time. I do not even write anything that could be interpreted as annoying or aggresive or out of context. I am generally a very mellow guy, an introvert, calm, somewhat empathic, but with a strong internal compass, etc. I am not trying to fight with people on purpose. I do not want to intentionally hurt anyone, make them angry or anything like that. When I was younger, I was always the odd one in school. In work, everywhere I go, it is always the same. People just do not want me around. They do not want to interact or talk, no matter if I am myself or if I try to pretend to be someone else, no matter if I try to be more social, or if I succumb to my anxiety, and I am tired of it. So that is why I am trying, but it just does not work. Is there something wrong with me? Something wrong with how I seeThe world how I speak or write, or maybe I am just incredibly unlucky, and I try to connect with the wrong people. If anyone has a clue what is going on or has something to share anything, I will appreciate that.

Grippy sock jail I am wheezing shout out psychiatric ok serious advice time tell your therapist even if it is normal good at the moment you might have a relapse and feel completely helpless so if you talk to your therapist and either find some ways to cope and make these breakdowns more manageable or talk about the things that set you off so you can process them and they do not come around as strong next time it will be better for you in the future granted the therapist does their job well but you said you like them so I think they do confusion something my therapist said that resonated with me was that it is like storing fat for winter right now in summer there is enough food around you are doing well you can deal with everyday life but when winter comes around and it is harsh and everything feels like too much to deal with you have already done some of the work before instead of trying to survive when you are in a much more vulnerable state also consider reaching out to friends if you feel safe in doing so, maybe tell them in advance things they can say to make you feel comforted and safe or how to help you if you need it wir konnen auch auf deutsche schreiben falls.

I do not want to die, but I do not want to live. I cried last class period. And when I try to talk to my mom about how I feel, she just tells me I should get over it or change. I keep thinking I just want to go home. And then I remember that when I do, she is just going to yell at me again. She always used harsh words, but today she called me evil. I guess it was the way she said it, but it just hurt. Then on days when theres a trigger for me ptsdconfusion I feel on edge for the entire day, and I come home and I want to try to find some type of comfort, anything to just make me feel even a little bit better, like I am not as alone as I actually am.

I bought a weighted blanket hoping it would help and it does, but it still is not the same as an actual human being.

If you cannot see a therapist. Self help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self help is a way to show you are serious that does not create friction in the family. In fact, it would not be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior. Self help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self help book explains what therapy for depression is like with depression. There is what seems like a catch. People say, I know there are things that will make me feel better, getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I am depressed, and I do not have the energy here. The thing very important people do have energy when they are depressed as much energy as they always do. But for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy. We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks. A famous psychiatrist, abraham low, said that when we cannot control our feelings, we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you our of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey. Try this when it seems that you are too tired to work lie on the couch, close your eyes and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for minutes. This is a motivation trick that is been used in behaviorModification programs since the if a task seems like it is too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy. Cleaning start by cleaning for or min, and take a min break. Homework, start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you are going to read by looking at headings, sub headings, etc. You do not have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise as little as min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually. So long as you do not make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve ilardi, the therapist researcher who headed the lifestyle depression project at the unit of kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise. If you go to metapsychology, you can read a psychologist review of do ilardi book splendid confusion of all the traditional mind body practices, meditation, etc. Confusion. The one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is yoga, breathing, slow breathing is used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder and ptsd. It safe, and it does not take any training video below details about self help. Based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also traditional asian methods. It has advice specifically for depressed students always remember that there are people you can talk to like a school counselor. My comments have goodInfo for coping in a crisis including the nigh hotline.

Title: Please give me your opinion.
Thread
Hello. I am a year old boy. Tomorrow, I will have my first therapy. I will tell the therapist these things the past years, I noticed that I have a lot of mood swings. I cannot really controll my anger, and I constantly hate myself. A week ago, my best friend said, that is enough, and what the fuck is your problem? I manipulated her and hurt her as much as I could. I did not want to. I tought. I help her. But I was wrong. When she said she leaves me. I lied because I do not want to stay alone. I always looked her down and I look down. Every person who I know I noticed that I always think I am the smartest in the room. When I found out someone is smarted, I study just to be more clever. I do not want to share emotions with anybody I know, because I do not think they will understand it. Like, months ago, I started to drink heavily and started smoking cigarette. I always said, that is wrong. But when I do it is alright. I always have a girl who I idealize, and I cannot live without her. So I do anything just so she stay. Please. Can you give me some opinions about my mental health?

You need therapy. Absolutely good luck with your therapy and yes, it would be better to tell your therapist everything you just wrote here and please respect the girl I am feeling really sorry for her. Appreciate her more.

Title: I feel like I am pretty rapidly exhausting my options with depression, but it is only getting worse.
Thread
I do not really know what I expect to get out of posting this, but at the very least, it might be cathartic to write it down. I have been dealing with depression for a while now, and I do not know what to do anymore. I am a guy in college, and I am just about to turn for context. I have been trying to diligently apply myself to self improvement, and nothing feels like it works. Maybe that is because of my attitude, but the attitude is, in itself, the problem I suppose I read stoic and buddhist philosophy. I try to apply those kinds of teachings in regards to controlling my expectations and emotions. I stay in shape. I have been eating pretty clean. I have deeply vested myself into martial arts, which is really the only remotely satisfying feeling thing in my life right now. I draw, and sometimes I write just to maintain my hobbies. I joined the mock trial team at my college so I could hold myself responsible to a team and have another thing to do. I try to socialize and see my friends. Whenever I can. I have even gotten back into therapy and started using my school resources on that front. Literally, nothing is doing it. For me, my lack of motivation just gets worse everyday. I can hardly sleep. And even though I am trying hard to be a diligent student, I can rarely drag myself to class or do homework anymore. I guess thatIs not really trying hard then, but it really feels like a lot of effort to me. Now, I used to have a gpa, but last semester, I got a because I failed some classes. Hopefully this semester will not get as out of hand. I am not the same fiery, passionate person I used to be everytime a class is about to start or an assignments due, all I can think is whatever nothing is fun to me anymore. I still play a lot of videogames and even go to tournaments, and they are not enjoyable. I do not enjoy eating anymore, so I do not do it as much, but I am still trying to eat healthy, so I usually force myself to at least eat something everyday. I do not know what to do anymore. I am just going through the motions and just getting out of bed has become a struggle. I feel a lot of shame for mistakes I have made in the past when they are really probably not that big a deal in the grand scheme of things I feel ashamed for being this way. I feel bad for the friends I am blessed with, because they have to put up with. Listening to me. I feel bad everytime I talk about something because I do not want to be that guy that is just a drag. I do not really want to be alive anymore, not out of pain so much as it is an extension of myLack of motivation ink what to do anymore. I really don. I do not know what is missing in my life or even if I can be normal again. Thanks for reading this far.

Title: I dont know what to do anymore.
Thread
I have struggled with anxiety and depression for years lately. It seems like I feel nothing except empty or negative emotions work has been terrible more and more is dumped on my plate while there are no consequences for others who continue to make the same mistakes over and over. People show up late on the daily. Nothing happens. I responded to an email send out going over changes. I politely expressed the fact that I had asked about these changes. Moths ago had sent an email and was given no response. I asked for clarification on things said this morning I come in to individuals talking out me discussing the email insulting me all talk, going quiet when they realized I was in the room. Passive aggressive jokes being made, obviously directed at me. I stayed silent. One of the three individuals is my boss. For months. When I talk to my husband. When I am upset or frustrated, he stays completely silent. No words of encouragement, no hug or kiss, nothing to try to cheer me up or make me smile. He says, when I ask about this, he is just trying to be a good listener. He did not used to be like this towards me. It seems like I am the problem in everyone is life. I realize when I am this down, I have no one. I feel like, actually cares. I have no one to talk to. I do not enjoy things I used to. I am having a hardTime concentrating. I feel so angry at everyone and myself. I hate myself a lot of the time. I try to hide it all with humor. I do not know how much of everyone is. Disdain or indifference to me is all in my head. My husband tells me I always think the worst, and that people do not like me. I do not know what to think. I have been taking medication for the past several years. It helps. Some I just feel so lost. Am I crazy or am I the problem? I do not know how to change. I am trying, but everything I do seems to fail, and people seem to just not care about me or not like me? Is it all in my head?

Title: Is it a symptom or a diagnosis?
Thread
So I will not bore you all with my back story however I have been seeking help to get sorted and I have being seeing a mental health nurse nearly every week since september october she got me an appointment with one of the doctors in the mental health team who I saw today at the end of the interview appointment I asked what is wrong with me and he said you have emotional instability I spoke with my mental health nurse after and she said it is not bad but can sometimes be called emotional dysregulation however, upon googling this to see what I can do to help me and what things I can put in place. It seems to refer to it more as a symptom yet they spoke about it more as a diagnosis therefore my question is what is it symptom or diagnosis all help is super appreciated.
Comments
The doctor probably has a vague idea, but not an official diagnosis yet. When I was getting evaluated, they had to review for a couple weeks. The dam is massive and complicated and sometimes gets specific, so the doctor probably has to review notes from the nurse and the interview, and any other questionnaires or evaluations you have done and match that up with the dam to find an exact diagnosis. Emotional dysregulation might just be the only thing that they can say for sure so far.

Title: Am I broken?
Thread
Hey, so this is my first ever post, but basically my first serious relationship. My ex was very manipulative and abusive verbally. He would mess with my by faking a suicide attempt or he would cheat, but I always forgave. It escalated until he put his hands on me, and unfortunately I still had feelings, and after moving out, I continued to see him where things just got worse, and he eventually forced himself on me without my consent. I never spoke about this, but we never talked again. He would stalk me some days, but not always, and eventually, I never heard from him again. After that, I became hypersexual. I was having sex with a lot of different guys safe sexconfusion, but was never happy. Eventually, I was starting to feel better and started a new job with some new friends I had been introduced to, and everything was good until I caught feelings for my and abuser. He was my friend for almost years before we dated. I was his first of, and everything was so good. In the beginning, after a year, we started getting into bigger and bigger arguments, where he would scream at me or punch holes in doors or walls. I tried so hard to keep the relationship together, but in the end, he put his hands on me, and the first time he put hands on me was the last, and I got a restraining order. However, I feel less like myself after this last breakup than iEver have. I cannot tell if it is because he broke a part of me or if I am just dwelling on it. But since the arguments got bad with him, we did not have sex. And even now, almost a year after the breakup, I have no sex drive. I do not want anyone to touch me. I do not even like being talked to by most men ink what I am trying to ask, but, like, am I okay? I do not feel ok. I have no motivation. I am so confused about my sexuality and who I am. Please. Any advice or stories that may help please share pleading face folded hands, face, exhaling

Confusion. I read the title and already had the answer. No, you are not broken. But after reading all this, my answer continues, first of all, what happened to you was not okay, nor was it your fault. It will never be your fault. These reactions are normal after someone goes through the traumatic experiences you have gone through. I highly suggest reaching out to a therapist for support and begin to work through some of the past traumas. Though I cannot share specific stories, I will say with some time and effort, you will be okay. I believe in you, and I am so proud of you for sharing you story. It takes a brave individual to do so, a friend and okay therapist

Title: I woke up from a nightmare, jerking my body up, preparing for a punch.
Thread
First of all, I would like to say that my brother is a big factor as to why I have bad anxiety and dysthymia. And about almost a year ago, all of my feelings and anger were finally voiced out towards him after a fight, I have never been a fighter. I always try to avoid fights, if possible, and my patience is usually strong. The dream was about my brother being an asshole towards me again, and I gained enough confidence once again to call him out on it. He then proceeds to try and be physical with me, and my parents are not doing anything at all to intervene. So I was obviously pretty scared, but I just thought, fuck it, and tried punching him back. But I woke up and found myself in a position wherein I was prepping for a punch. I am quite concerned about this, and I am planning to talk to my psychiatrist about it son. When I meet her, I do not know how to make sense about this, because this is also the first time it happened

I something similar for years the dreams always involved spiders and I used to wake up standing at the light switch these went on well into adulthood look up sleep terrors or night terrors I think they are pretty harmless.

Having so many worries gets so overwhelming that dealing with a single one is overwhelming. It often feels like one task is so difficult and complicated that I do not even know where to start, even though its something that takes minutes. And I have done many times before anxiety is awful and treatment really does have to be one step at a time.

Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy. Cbtconfusion than with medicine, and some are successful with self help. Based on cut, I can show you some cut self help. But first I want to say that recently, there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing. When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently. Seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain and you feel better. Also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication don overlook stress management it can help even with very bad anxiety. Video a lot of helpful information, including the partProgram of brown and gerbarg.

Title: Recently, confusion I have been experiencing severe attention deficit ink if its relevant to this subs or not but I did not know where else to ask.
Thread
I believe I have been experiencing this issue for about a year or two I do not even what I am experiencing is attention deficit or not basically recently I found myself having a very bad short term memory for example this morning I was cooking so I opened a can and put it aside for using it later in the cooking but when I needed the ingredients in the can, after trying to recall it many times, I could not remember where I had kept it. The same thing happened to spatula and salt. Within minutes I forgot where I kept things and it is not just today it happens to me every day quite a few times this same thing started to hamper my study as well, like I always find myself having difficulties keeping track even one or two variables in a math problem. It not like I am bad at math infact I have had always the highest grades in math, but these problems have been severe recently is this normal? Or I need to give more information. My family does not have any records on illness of my ancestors, so I cannot really tell if any of my grandparents faced any mental illness

You need a therapy. This actually sounds more than serious if you cannot recognize yourself anymore if you do things you usually would not do, and that even might endanger yourself do not hesitate to get professional help. And I am sorry to say this. But this is not only just depression and natural poor, long term memory. This can escalate into something dangerous if not treated correctly. Have you ever heard of dissociative fugue or dissociative amnesia?

Title: People ignore me all the time and I do not know why.
Thread
I cut to the chase. No matter what I do, I feel like I simply do not exist to other people, at least in my head. That is how it looks like. But I honestly think I have good reasons to believe that I am not counting in real life interactions with my family, for example, because that is different. But whenever I try to connect with anyone through the internet discord or phone, this is more or less what happens on a daily basis. People I call friends, people I know since childhood, they either never respond to my phone messages or they respond after a very long time days, even, and the answer is often just the most basic, bland reply you can imagine. It feels like it is written in a very dismissive manner. This I can somewhat understand, because people have their own lives, they are not always glued to their phones, etc. I feel like this is pretty normal confusion. Talking to people on discord, people I know from the internet, even if pinged and they are active, they completely ignore my message and continue talking about the same topic or about something else. It, like my message never appeared on their screens. Sometimes, even if I try to casually add something to the conversation, the entire conversation stops on the spot. If that happened once or twice. Sure, I would not mind. But this literally happens, like of the time I write anything, it simply feels abnormal, like it shouldNot happen not that often, posts on social media or forums are no different. It got so bad that I genuinely believe this post itself will be ignored, too. I expect that to happen. I already wrote a similar post on another subreddit about mental health. It was about being ignored. Lo and behold, it was ignored, too, only reaffirming my worries. I see other posts getting massive amounts of interactions and upvotes on that same subreddit, and my post just went unnoticed it, like it never existed. And it happens all the time. I do not even write anything that could be interpreted as annoying or aggresive or out of context. I am generally a very mellow guy, an introvert, calm, somewhat empathic, but with a strong internal compass, etc. I am not trying to fight with people on purpose. I do not want to intentionally hurt anyone, make them angry or anything like that. When I was younger, I was always the odd one in school. In work, everywhere I go, it is always the same. People just do not want me around. They do not want to interact or talk, no matter if I am myself or if I try to pretend to be someone else, no matter if I try to be more social, or if I succumb to my anxiety, and I am tired of it. So that is why I am trying, but it just does not work. Is there something wrong with me? Something wrong with how I seeThe world how I speak or write, or maybe I am just incredibly unlucky, and I try to connect with the wrong people. If anyone has a clue what is going on or has something to share anything, I will appreciate that.

Being noticed here on the internet is random chance one thing I know for sure is that whining turns off literally everyone I know because I whine all the time so much that my own mother does not even want to talk to me sometimes I know there is not much we can do complaining about what plagues our lives is hard we share the same deck of cards I do not deal with it I throw myself into work could be useful could be futile I do not care as long as it takes my mind away from the thought internet friends fuck every single one of them if you have the possibility to meet them irl do it.

Title: Confusion I fucked up my life.
Thread
I here I moved across the country to wyoming, from florida with my boyfriend, confusion, who I was not even with for a year yet stupid. I know I quit my job that I loved. I left the place I called home and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. Things are not going smoothly. Its the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues. Communication has gotten the worst it is ever been minor, but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me he would be better about lack of trust in him due to his lies baggage on his end, causing major strain between the two of us mother in law, exesconfusion. I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end, since I quit my well paying job in florida to come here. My credit cards have not gotten paid since november and my bank account is, he told me he was going to take care of me financially. He hasnt. I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in florida for years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings were not reliant upon some guy I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced bed bath apartment back in florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now I threw away everything I valued andLoved about my life for some guy that cannot even be honest with me on a consistent basis for a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me for a guy who just does not understand me, even though he likes to act like he does, I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid. And you want to know what the worst part is. I do not think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make a month now I am not only broke I am in severe debt now things will never be the same because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was. I guess I cannot even do that, right? I am quite literally good for nothing. I should have done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. I do not even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I cannot even be mad at him. I did it to myself.

The first step I would take is to evaluate the situation as objectively as possible. Maybe talking to someone you trust as a second opinion, or an internet stranger, lolconfusion questions I would ask, for example, are, can I ask someone for help until I get on more stable footing? Is it feasible for me to leave, etc. And then go from there? Figuring out next steps and thinking about the future having a plan always helps me. Maybe it help you, too. Yes, this decision may have been ill advised, but it does not mean the end by a long shot. If you are willing to try to better your situation, I believe you can find a way might be a little naive, but I am feeling hopeful. Todayconfusion

Title: People ignore me all the time and I do not know why.
Thread
I cut to the chase. No matter what I do, I feel like I simply do not exist to other people, at least in my head. That is how it looks like. But I honestly think I have good reasons to believe that I am not counting in real life interactions with my family, for example, because that is different. But whenever I try to connect with anyone through the internet discord or phone, this is more or less what happens on a daily basis. People I call friends, people I know since childhood, they either never respond to my phone messages or they respond after a very long time days, even, and the answer is often just the most basic, bland reply you can imagine. It feels like it is written in a very dismissive manner. This I can somewhat understand, because people have their own lives, they are not always glued to their phones, etc. I feel like this is pretty normal confusion. Talking to people on discord, people I know from the internet, even if pinged and they are active, they completely ignore my message and continue talking about the same topic or about something else. It, like my message never appeared on their screens. Sometimes, even if I try to casually add something to the conversation, the entire conversation stops on the spot. If that happened once or twice. Sure, I would not mind. But this literally happens, like of the time I write anything, it simply feels abnormal, like it shouldNot happen not that often, posts on social media or forums are no different. It got so bad that I genuinely believe this post itself will be ignored, too. I expect that to happen. I already wrote a similar post on another subreddit about mental health. It was about being ignored. Lo and behold, it was ignored, too, only reaffirming my worries. I see other posts getting massive amounts of interactions and upvotes on that same subreddit, and my post just went unnoticed it, like it never existed. And it happens all the time. I do not even write anything that could be interpreted as annoying or aggresive or out of context. I am generally a very mellow guy, an introvert, calm, somewhat empathic, but with a strong internal compass, etc. I am not trying to fight with people on purpose. I do not want to intentionally hurt anyone, make them angry or anything like that. When I was younger, I was always the odd one in school. In work, everywhere I go, it is always the same. People just do not want me around. They do not want to interact or talk, no matter if I am myself or if I try to pretend to be someone else, no matter if I try to be more social, or if I succumb to my anxiety, and I am tired of it. So that is why I am trying, but it just does not work. Is there something wrong with me? Something wrong with how I seeThe world how I speak or write, or maybe I am just incredibly unlucky, and I try to connect with the wrong people. If anyone has a clue what is going on or has something to share anything, I will appreciate that.

I can answer your questions. No problem. You have all the qualities required to have friends, no issues there. You need to alter you. Expectations of the internet being ignorableconfusion is the main draw of it, along with little to no accountability consequences. If you have an expectation when talking to someone on the internet that you do not know, irl your messing up your trying, which is more than most people haven you noticed? Lol confusion, which means it will absolutely work in the right environment. Lastly, if you want faster results of real friendships that are not just talking to kill time, then you need common ground. I would suggest a local club activity hiking, reading, competitive gaming, fishing, wrestling, karateconfusion, anything to get you around like people for any amount of time in a common, shared interest that do it

In life, we make mistakes and we learn from them again and again and again. It ok. You ve got zero safety net, zero relatives, family, nothing and noone to fall back to. Are there free mental health services in your municipality country? I fucked up my life coming from someone who is with debt is just simply not true. If you were say, and were with this person for years and had like debt then maybe but still.

Title: Too much screen time.
Thread
Don judge. But on some days, my screen time is up to like, my phone is the only thing that distracts me from the world. So I spend most of my time staring at it. I do not have any friends, so I never really do anything. I do not have a job, and I live with my parents. I go to school bit. I skip a lot of classes. When I do go there, I am on my phone most of the time because the classes are so boring, and my mind always just starts thinking about ways to kill myself, so I would not have to do this anymore. I know high screen time is linked with poor mental health, but so are suicidal thoughts. And currently, the only thing keeping them away is my phone. Sometimes I can do something that distracts me for a while, but it happens rarely and does not last long. I do not know what I should do anymore.

I can suggest writing a huge list of everything that you love and I mean everything no matter how tough every day waking moment feels I can guarantee that you can write an entire page of things that you love and I am not talking about huge things go deep and write down every single detail I love the feeling of wind in my hair I love the ocean I love music I love observing people I love walking at night I love to journal my thoughts these are all things that are not huge commitments I am not writing big hobbies that involve spending hundreds of dollars although make sure to include all of these tooconfusion on this list include nothing to do with your phone or any screen as we clearly know that the objective is to reduce the amount of time this is done once you have your list I would probably pick the easiest things that you can do that will bring you some sort of joy and then start off small pick if you canconfusion of the things on this list and try to ensure that at some point in your day you incorporate them you may only feel better than if you did not do it but once these are a part of your routine and you no longer actively have to think about doing them then you can start to build on it and introduce more things just to reference I am speaking from a severe year computer gameAddiction. So I can tell you, from experience, hours on a screen was a good day for me, it often be quite a bit higher with lots of work and commitment. I still have a long way to go, but those memories of my old chapter are becoming a more distant memory. Also, I would highly encourage you to speak with your parents and have them install and password protectconfusion. A screen time limiting app on your phone. This has nothing to do with punishing you. This is a tool that will change your life and make these feelings of helplessness a thing of the past. They can still give you a lot of time or hoursconfusion to start with, so that you do not feel like you are losing everything. But the main idea is to have a blackout period to force your brain to be bored, like, really bored to a point where you force yourself to implement anything into your routine. If I can make a life changing recommendation, do the above, pick a time in the morning am is a great starting pointconfusion and make your phone unavailable to you before this time. The app can make this happen for you and then do the same thing in the evening with at least before your bed timeconfusion. I would personally suggest having it stop after dinner. Time around pmconfusion. This will give you time in the morning to focus on eating a good breakfast, getting a headstart on the morning. With aClear head. And then in the evening, having a healthy wind down routine to clear your mind, promote good sleep, which then prepares you even better for the next dayconfusion at the end of the day, nothing changes if nothing changes. So the only way to help yourself is to make healthy amendments. Big or smallconfusion to the way that you live every day. Honestly, this post is turning really long, and it cant be fixed in one post or one day or one year. It is an ongoing process, and I am happy to help. I honestly have so many tips. Please do me if you feel that I may be able to help. I have been there, I have felt all those things. I have had so many failures in my life as a result of it, and I am starting to move into a really healthy place and would love to share them with you

Do things you are interested. God dammit it. I have been there before. I quickly figured I love playing roleplaying games. They immersed me out of my stressful life for as long as I was running a game, I would suggest for you to explore what you enjoy doing. This sounds like a classic. Just do some hobbies comment, but this is the best way to end your problem. Don look at this comment and say you will find a hobby and never even bother looking for one. Put down your phone right now and look for local clubs in your area. Find people who enjoy your sense of humour, the things you like watching on your phone, etc. Do something about it.

Screen time is linked with poor mental health. That is true, but it is not because you spend too much time on the phone that you have mental issues. It is because you have a poor mental health that you spend so much time on your phone. So do not confuse the causal direction in this case. So with that cleared, it is evident that the problem is not you spending too much time on the phone, but your most likelyconfusion depression. You could say that your phone is your way of coping with your worse suicidal thoughts. So do not think of it as something awful, but instead of your own way of helping yourself. And I agree with nousernameiguess that you should maybe try out new things and searching for a hobby, try out seth. You always thought was interesting, preferably an activity that involves other people, like going to a sports or arts club, joining the gym, trying out a debate club, taking dance lessons, doing voluntary work. You could also try to look for a small job to get some extra money. There are a lot of things that are worth trying wish you all the best

Title: Am I just scared or do not have motivation?
Thread
So for a while, I have not brushed my teeth. I do not want to say how long because I feel badconfusion, and I always get told you just do not want to or you do not have motivation. Just get it done. But every time I try, I get anxious and a little hesitant, and when I start to brush my teeth, I actually want to cry. Both the noise and the feeling almost trigger my flight or fight response, and I want to run and just cry. And I have tried so much, but im just scared. I want to brush my teeth. I do, but I get so anxious and sad, and it does not help that multiple people comment on it, and I always thought it was just because I was not motivated, like what people always said. But I am starting to think I am just scared, and I think I do know why, but it does not seem exactly right, but if it will help me figure this out, il say why. So as a child, I would never brush my teeth like any other child, so my dad and my mom would hold me down on the floor, couch, lap, etc. And would shove the brush in my mouth, and it sometimes hurt. But as I said, ink, if that has anything to do with it, I just want help.

Hey, my friend I want you to know that what you are going through has happened to others and you are not crazy for feeling it all. Part of being human things happen to us. I have a couple thoughts for you what you are going through does remind me of ocd. Honestly, it is different. But the intensity of emotion and the obsessive avoiding might reflect ocd are you much of a perfectionist or procrastinate frequently? Just something to consider looking in to and researching for yourself. It seems that you have trauma surrounding brushing your teeth, right? It is so hard, but your brain has associated many negative things with it, and that means you are going to have to associate new thoughts and feelings with brushing your teeth to replace these ones. You need to train your brain to perceive it differently. Here are a few suggestions you could start by thinking of and writing about all the things about teeth brushing that are good. Write down and think of the health benefits. The sensation of clean teeth, the taste of minty tooth paste or whatever you likeconfusion, etc. Take time to write out the details and do this multiple times over a week. Avoid all the fear surrounding, not brushing your teeth. And what that might lead to as this may only drive you to not brush your teeth anymore. Think of the positive things associated with what you want to be doing. Do not think about what you do not wantAfter training your brain this way for a while, then think these same types of thoughts before you brush your teeth, then brush them, then think thoughts about how brave it was to brush them and things you are grateful for about brushing your teeth. Maybe start with brushing for seconds and slowly work up over time. I really hope something here helps, or perhaps it will do nothing for you. I hope it does, though. Let me know if you have any questions I am rooting for you.

Title: Am I just scared or do not have motivation?
Thread
So for a while, I have not brushed my teeth. I do not want to say how long because I feel badconfusion, and I always get told you just do not want to or you do not have motivation. Just get it done. But every time I try, I get anxious and a little hesitant, and when I start to brush my teeth, I actually want to cry. Both the noise and the feeling almost trigger my flight or fight response, and I want to run and just cry. And I have tried so much, but im just scared. I want to brush my teeth. I do, but I get so anxious and sad, and it does not help that multiple people comment on it, and I always thought it was just because I was not motivated, like what people always said. But I am starting to think I am just scared, and I think I do know why, but it does not seem exactly right, but if it will help me figure this out, il say why. So as a child, I would never brush my teeth like any other child, so my dad and my mom would hold me down on the floor, couch, lap, etc. And would shove the brush in my mouth, and it sometimes hurt. But as I said, ink, if that has anything to do with it, I just want help.

I dont know anything about this, but if I were you, I would try to start with just puting my toothbrush on my teeth, then doing like sec, witout water, then put some water on, etc. For months until you get to toothpaste. But I dont know if you can start with that.

It is definitely genuine fear. If you are worried about dental hygiene, dentists say it is far more important to floss, so maybe try doing that and maybe using a mouthwash while you slowly build up to using a toothbrush again, hope this helps.

I do not think it is a question of motivation since you are clearly trying. Recognition is an important and hard first step. You ve made progress. No advice since someone before already has a way better comment than I could give pure motivation have a nice day.

Go find a therapy or talk to someone I used to be like. Sometime I still be like this. It could be a sign of depression or anxiety or both, but do not self diagnose. Get some help if you can.

As someone who struggled with this for years because I just didnt care I dont think its because of that for me its because I was and still amconfusion too depressed to care on top of that, I have adhd and its he most boring thing for me to do. What made me change it is that my molars became brittle enough to actually break off in small pieces this started giving me nightmares to the point my brain blackmailed itself into doing it. I still struggle with the electric brushes as I cant stand the vibrations in my head I hope it helps you feel a bit less alone

Sounds like you have trauma surrounding this part of your life. My wife has pretty bad trauma with anyone commenting on her hygiene, I understand what you are going through. It is so hard if I may suggest try wrapping a washcloth around your pointer finger and using scrubbing your teeth with that then use a mint or mouthwash. They also make finger toothbrushes such as the do browns silicone finger toothbrush. They also have disposable finger toothbrushes such as the ardent textured, disposable teeth wipes or if you feel you can use something like collate wisps those could help. They are smaller than a toothbrush, so they may not be as traumatizing if a smaller toothbrush helps maybe look into getting a kids toothbrush you could even get one with a cartoon character you like or one that lights up anything you need to help you. Any of these items may help you ease into using a toothbrush

Title: People ignore me all the time and I do not know why.
Thread
I cut to the chase. No matter what I do, I feel like I simply do not exist to other people, at least in my head. That is how it looks like. But I honestly think I have good reasons to believe that I am not counting in real life interactions with my family, for example, because that is different. But whenever I try to connect with anyone through the internet discord or phone, this is more or less what happens on a daily basis. People I call friends, people I know since childhood, they either never respond to my phone messages or they respond after a very long time days, even, and the answer is often just the most basic, bland reply you can imagine. It feels like it is written in a very dismissive manner. This I can somewhat understand, because people have their own lives, they are not always glued to their phones, etc. I feel like this is pretty normal confusion. Talking to people on discord, people I know from the internet, even if pinged and they are active, they completely ignore my message and continue talking about the same topic or about something else. It, like my message never appeared on their screens. Sometimes, even if I try to casually add something to the conversation, the entire conversation stops on the spot. If that happened once or twice. Sure, I would not mind. But this literally happens, like of the time I write anything, it simply feels abnormal, like it shouldNot happen not that often, posts on social media or forums are no different. It got so bad that I genuinely believe this post itself will be ignored, too. I expect that to happen. I already wrote a similar post on another subreddit about mental health. It was about being ignored. Lo and behold, it was ignored, too, only reaffirming my worries. I see other posts getting massive amounts of interactions and upvotes on that same subreddit, and my post just went unnoticed it, like it never existed. And it happens all the time. I do not even write anything that could be interpreted as annoying or aggresive or out of context. I am generally a very mellow guy, an introvert, calm, somewhat empathic, but with a strong internal compass, etc. I am not trying to fight with people on purpose. I do not want to intentionally hurt anyone, make them angry or anything like that. When I was younger, I was always the odd one in school. In work, everywhere I go, it is always the same. People just do not want me around. They do not want to interact or talk, no matter if I am myself or if I try to pretend to be someone else, no matter if I try to be more social, or if I succumb to my anxiety, and I am tired of it. So that is why I am trying, but it just does not work. Is there something wrong with me? Something wrong with how I seeThe world how I speak or write, or maybe I am just incredibly unlucky, and I try to connect with the wrong people. If anyone has a clue what is going on or has something to share anything, I will appreciate that.

To be honest, my friend I feel you on this to coming from a messed up place where even women spit in your face when you just want friendship and after watching myself go from being on top of the world and an inspiration to a broken shadow of myself I totally relate and it is not like I fall and not try to get back as I have tried. But the loneliness and anxiety I live with just wreck me further to a point I pray I do not open my eyes sometimes as nothing hurts more than just wanting to share your ideas and dreams and just being ignored like trash sometimes as I just so tired of this. But the only that keeps me going is the hope that somehow I will get out of this position as I am only here for my mother and trust me, there are people that will feel it if something happens to you, even me, as nobody deserves to suffer like this

Try to find better people to be around and express yourself. Try new things but do not pretend to be someone else, cause that is not going to get you anywhere and being ignored on reddit or stuff that happens even on this subreddit, people only care and want their mental issues to be replied too more. With that mentality, I think this subreddit is flawed. Maybe your just on the wrong side of the coin, the coin being luck, but just express yourself and seek stuff out. Do not expect everything to fall into your hands just like that.

Well from what I can read is that you have always tried out the big, anonymous groups. So if no one answers, you in those big groups do not get discouraged by this. Just think of it as the standard setting that you get ignored in big groups and think of it as seth special. And a reason to celebrate. If someone actually reacts to your message, it still kind of hurts. But sadly, no one of us is an a list celebrity with thousands of followers and regarding the messaging to friends thing instead of shallow small talk online. How about meeting them? Irl everyone of us is probably dead tired of shallow, small talk online. So next time do not wait too long, just outright ask them when they are free to meet up for a coffee or whatever. If it is friends who live farther away and you cannot meet up. That sucks, but then it is time to search for friends in your area. Maintaining relationships is a lot about cost and benefits. The costs is the energy to keep in touch, replying, writing, remembering details about the other personconfusion. But what benefits can you get out of a friend who lives far away? You cannot meet up to hang out? You cannot have pleasant coffee outings. You cannot go watch movies together is not that. The reason why people say out of sight out of mind, personally speaking, the only friendships I can still maintain even when we live in otherCities hours away from each other are those that will probably last my lifetime.

Title: Am I nod or just screwed up?
Thread
Basically, that is the question. Back when I was a kid, I was diagnosed with hyperactivity a bit mature for my age aswell as an hyperactivity kid and first born son, I was doing shit all the time, and my education ended up to be based on physical punishment. It affected me so much that from my fifth grade forward, noone believed I was diagnosed with it. I oppressed my emotions. I suffered bullying in my school for being the fat but smart kid in the class. When I get into college, I was still closed for emotions and a lot of social interactions were confused to me, although I found a few friends which our relation exist till today. Years laterconfusion, I dated for years, and I know that during that time I felt I was learning how to feel again instead of having it in me already. But our relation ended because it seems the emotions I was showing were not good enough and was after breaking up that this question has been raised a multiple times from new people I encountered. And now from myself. Years ago, I became obsessed in working myself and my image, although I might have some stepbacks from overthinkingconfusion, I look for attention in new people, but at the same time I make them go away or I simple step back if I feel they are going to hurt me or if I feel they are more screwed than me. Take this for an example. If someone thatHas this own demons to face and approach and start expressing without I even ask it makes me feel repugnance for that person, but if someone is doing the same but does not show you pressing their emotions aswell, I tend to approach that person and get their trust. I moved countries years ago and is been really challenging for me to build a social network in the new country. I only have friends that I know I can count on. I feel sad for not having a wide group, but at the same time, I feel grateful for having them. I am getting confused with this and for what I saw in nod traits is like asking myself if I am in a god damn simulation or not

It sounds like a stupid question, but I really do not understand. My life is picture perfect. I have a job that pays the bills and allows for savings, a nice apartment, nice vehicle, a family full of love and support and great health. So I really do not understand every day is a struggle to find genuine happiness. And sometimes being energetic and happy feels so exhausting. Despite having a perfect life, I somehow hate it and am constantly desiring all the things I do not already have, and I hate that about myself. I cannot remember the last time I genuinely laughed or felt the feeling of happiness, excitement, etc. And I am hoping someone could help me to understand why

Your brain can block out painful memories and make you forget they ever happened. Theyare called repressed memories.

Title: How long does it take for someone who needs a break to come back online?
Thread
My friend, ex of used to talk to me everyday now since a half year ago, she has been talking less and less to me now. She is only online about once in months when she is online. That is usually only for a minute before she disappears for months again. She explained that its not my fault and she is still interested in me. She also said that she is not busy with anything important, so I really dont understand why she rarely talks to me. She also said she became an alcoholic and trying to recover from it. No idea how bad it is right now. The last time she talked to me was on the new years day since then, she has not talked to me. It has been months now. I just want an idea of when she will come back. How long can this take? Should I assume I have to wait a whole year? I do not understand. She said. She is not busy. And she also said, she still likes me, so why does she rarely talk to me? How long do I probably have to wait till she comes online to read my messages
Comments
She is not busy and she still likes you, but will not talk to you. I hate to break it to you, dude. But we both know she does not have romantic feelings for you. If she did, she would want to talk to you, but she doesn. She maybe also does not want her life to be completely online. But whatever the reason is, she is not into you anymore. I am sorry.

That is usually only for a minute before she disappears for months again. She explained that its not my fault and she is still interested in me. She also said that she is not busy with anything important, so I really dont understand why she rarely talks to me. She also said she became an alcoholic and trying to recover from it. No idea how bad it is right now. The last time she talked to me was on the new years day since then, she has not talked to me. It has been months now. I just want an idea of when she will come back. How long can this take? Should I assume I have to wait a whole year? I do not understand. She said. She is not busy. And she also said, she still likes me, so why does she rarely talk to me? How long do I probably have to wait till she comes online to read my messages

Title: Is lack of emotions a sign of depression
Thread
I saw a video on internet that said, depression do not require any particular reason. Lack of emotions is a sign of depression. I doubt it is true.
Comments
Yes, people become depressed for no apparent defined reason. Their life can seem objectively fine, but one brain chemistry can get out of whack over time, and some people are genetically predisposed to depression. One criteria in clinical depression is either sadness or hopelessness, which evoke emotions. But some people, especially with chronic depression, may become more numb to things like joy or experience life in a more blunted fashion.

Title: Can you have a trauma even if you cannot remember?
Thread
So my I have been going to see a psychiatrist and a psychotherapist for possible autism, adhd, bipolar disorder and ocd, and my psychotherapist told me that she thinks I may have various traumas due to my father hitting me when I was younger. However, I cannot even remember anymore, and I now have a great relationship with my father. How can I possibly have a trauma?
Comments
An individual can have trauma that they do not remember like a bad car accident where somebody got knocked out instantlyconfusion. The key from a mental health perspective is if it causes distress, anxiety, tangentially related nightmares, etcconfusion. If one does not have distress reactions, then it is not a mental health concern or would warrant diagnosis. Since distress impairment is required for any diagnosis. So using the car accident example, if somebody does not remember the specific accident but is nervous riding in cars or has trouble driving, they should seek treatment. Somebody else who has no problems is fine because a traumatic event does not have to turn into ptsd or related disorder

Title: I have a dread condition.
Thread
My hope in posting is to ease pain and hopefully make sense about what I experience. I do not want anyone to go through what I do ever. It is horrible. And I knew something awful was happening that was very bad in my early twenties, and I had to leave school and became even more depressed and knew I needed help, because I came to the point I believed I needed to end my life it such a big part of my story, poor mental health, suffering beyond anything I can handle, feeling horribly scared and lonely and overwhelmed. The experience is more than I can say in words and would never want anyone to have it, because then they would understand, wanting to end their lives too. I want to tell people who might have similar suffering, depression, add anxiety, bipolar insomnia, that it is going to go away. You will be better if you take medication and exercise and eat healthy and blah. But I am now and suffering bad. Maybe some of you have some good ideas, and I would be happy to hear it. The suffering is beyond anything I know what to do with. I am living with an old friend from graduate school and can hardly move. Sometimes therapy is kind useful, but mostly I need new ideas. Maybe writing helps. Maybe it will help someone else. I hope so.

Title: Whats the next step in treating my anxiety?
Thread
I have had ocd adhd and anxiety in general since. As long as I remembered, I have been on setraline, my and quetiapine, my for about years since I was right now. I am on my of lexapro, and I occasionally take concert when my adhd is bad. The only medication that has actually helped me with my ocd and anxiety is bromazepam. I know the risk of addiction and dependence on these drugs, but they are really the only ones that gave me any noticible improvement. Sadly, for some weird reason, I can only get pills of my of bromazepam prescribed every few months. I feel like I am trying my best I can to live without needing benzodiazepines. I exercise as much as I can. I take cold showers, I do breathing exercises. I started trying to eat better, get enough sleep. But the anxiety just keeps getting worse and worse. It often feels like im about to snap at any moment and kill myself. What should I do? Should I go ahead and try another sari and hope that this one may work. Sorry for bad english.

Title: Dealing with sleep interruption stress in the middle of the night.
Thread
So I have this issue. I need hours of sleep or I can hardly function. And if my sleep gets significantly interrupted, I basically fly off the handle, I toss and turn and groan, and according to my partner, sometimes yell, curse, but I do not have much recollection of it. Sometimes I cannot go back to sleep at all. I already struggle with managing my negative emotions, but in the middle of the night, any ability to do so seems to go out the window. Last night, I tried doing breathing exercises, but it really did not do much. I was basically up at until I had to start work at. And I feel like a zombie. I always feel terrible about it. Once I am fully awake, can anyone relate to this? Any tips for how to manage my emotions better? When I am half asleep, I hate being this person, and I want to do better

Please do not do it. I will listen. I know you probably do not care cause it is just a stranger or the internet, but sometimes a stranger on the internet is just what you need. Im not going to pretend that I know what your going through, but I care im proud of you for holding on. Sometimes it feels better to let go, but once your in the air you realise how much you want something to hold on to something again ive tried, and if you do your probably going to wish you did not maybe try weed it helped meconfusion.

Title: I am trying but it is so hard.

Life has ups and downs. I know that and I try, but I mess up more than I do good, but I am trying, right? I feel as though I am falling off a cliff, seeing the world pass me, but I am not there. I want to be. I want to be a part of the world around me, but every time that I do, I always mess up, I do something wrong. But every time I try and fix it, I will always try and fix it. But after so long of trying and messing up the one thing that makes it seem that I am not giving up is my willpower. But in the end, it is hard. The ground is slamming into me at unknown speeds, and I am trying to hold on to the rocks on the edge of that metaphorical cliff.

I can tell you have been through a lot and still are I am older than you had a life filled with pain chaos, some of it dished out to me, and some of it perpetuated by myself as a result of abuse and dismissive caregivers in childhood. I recognized at different points that there are no promises, no guarantees, but just giving up and not trying is the only way to fail. Currently, there are treatment methods that never existed when I was a teen, young adult, etc. Neuroscience is revolutionizing a lot of treatments. Therapy is changing right along with it now, there are dozens of ways to do therapy, and a lot of them are actually effective. Transcranial magnetic stimulation is really helping a very depressed friend in just a month. It is completely reversed. Her suicidal ideation and depression, stay curious, check in with medical journals, ask the docs questions. Listen to the huberman lab on youtube or podcast apps. Do huberman is not a medical doctor, but a neurobiologist teaching at stanford. He has the inside scoop on a lot of how the body works, and upcoming treatments for things that actually help people writing does help. So does therapy. But there are lots of other things. Insurance actually covers some of them. Maybe it feels hopeless. But the top of the list of things I have learned is that feelings will lie to me when I am feeling hopeless and I should keep asking questions and looking for options.

Personally, I had a therapist convince me I had trauma because I had symptoms of trauma, and there were certainly traumatic, evens that shaped me, but not to the degree of how badly I was functioning. Turns out symptoms of trauma and symptoms of adhd are very similar, and everything I was struggling with could be explained by my adhd diagnosis. This is not everyone is experience, but it certainly was mine.

Comments
I would begin a journal for yourself, and I would prepare a separate note with bullet points or an outline of specific issues. Bring both to your appointment. But do not be surprised if the doctor only reads the shorter outline and just glances at the journal that way you have covered your bases, and you will not forget to tell them something. Hopefully, depending on your issues, the doctor will prescribe medication or counseling, or maybe both. Its not easy to discuss serious issues, but it is the first step to feeling better. Best of luck.

Title: I feel like I have no one.
Thread
The thought of being alone and not having anybody is something I have personally had a hard time dealing with since childhood nowconfusion, it is gotten to the point it has kept me up all night and has made me pretty consistently sad. I have gone through mental health complications in life due to other personal reasons. However, it seems like now my whole mindset is so numb that I no longer feel anything. What used to feel like wanting to cry daily or be sad for seemingly no reason has gone to an abyss of numbness. Being in the military. Now, it really seems that it has increased this way of thinking, as it seems like everybody else has someone to go back home too. Yet all I seem to have are my car that I have spent too much money modifying, and my two friends who are no where, near my home and out of state and our schedules never match up. As we get older, I do not know what to do anymore.

Feels relatable. That is what leaves me angry. Why did having anyone ever matter? I mean, it feels nice. But these restless, lonely nights of constant, never ending thoughts made me think to myself, why any of this? Don you think the fear of being alone made us forget we have our own personal time?

I am not sure how old you are, but it is relevant when you are an adult in university, then your mental health concerns are, in theory, kept more confidential. Youre known to be either still a teen or very young if you are a traditional student. So there is an underlying assumption that you may or may not understand your rights. Its a gamble for them to violate these rights, though, especially if you paid full tuition or have parents who have donated. There is politics behind how you are treated in different institutions. In grade school, your teachers are all likely to be alerted to relevant information, even if the info is limited to student requires health exemption, or student is being seen by the schools behavioral health specialist and may be required to leave class for counseling or something along those lines. Ime I had a complete mental breakdown at and still in is usconfusion. This pissed off teacher had me sent to the school shrink, as opposed to my assigned counselor. They took me to the local department of health and tried to get me medicated without my mom knowing. And all my teachers gave me this sad sort of look. In the weeks that followed, I could tell they would all got some kind of email about me like a notice that I was in counseling, maybe so that if I was falling behind, they would understand and not ask me about it or so that they could look out forChanges in my behavior or whatever. I really do not know. Il never know exactly what was communicated or why what was considered relevant to know, but I know something was communicated because they were all side eying me where they normally would not have. Thats all I know. It was not a big deal. Only one teacher was a dick. No one brought anything up with me. No rumors spread among students. The teacher who was a dick, although it upset me at the time I learned years later was a dick, because she is just a weird ass person. I had an encounter with her as an adult that made it very clear to me that she was a strange, mean and pathetic sort of woman who I definitely should not have wasted energy concerning myself about as a child, I also realized that the other adults around me when she was my teacher definitely felt the same way I just could not clock it at the time, why she was pretty much being publicly shamed by other teachers. After she reported me, another teacher actually got into a verbal argument with her. I think she had a reputation. There are always going to be weird adults in schools like of all kinds, in the interest of being honest, I am going to say you are likely to have adults know, but they are meant to be professionals. So for the most part, you can kind of assume how well it will go basedOn their everyday conduct? Are your teachers messy? Do they maintain appropriate boundaries? You have an adult advocate, do you have easily exploited vulnerabilities that someone might be led to believe you have no one to talk to about? You have two parents so that alone is an advantage even if they are not immediately involved?

Title: Is school trustworthy
Thread
Hey so I just told my dad I have depression it took months and I have had it a year he was nice to me and supporting and I asked him not to tell my mum which he accepted he is going to phone my school next week and ask them to support me I do not want anyone knowing about what I am going through are schools trustworthy when it comes to this stuff I want to get support but I do not want anyone knowing what I have gone through except the therapist supporter
Comments
It hard to say the point I want to make is that regardless of how the school responds to this, I think you will feel better if you follow if the advice for therapists on how to deal with work. A famous psychiatrist, abraham low, says that when people are depressed, it is therapeutic for them to go about their daily activities as close to normal as possible. This is liable to be slower than usual, but that is all right, low also recommends simple motivation methods for helping people overcome their sense of helplessness. These methods have been shown to work for generations, taking things in baby steps. Very important. This is the key to motivation and motivation is the key to recovery. If a task seems like it is too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy homework. Start by proofreading a paper or by previewing a chapter you are going to read by looking at headings, sub headings, etc. Emma seppala of yale suggests conserving our energy by going back and forth between challenging tasks and easy ones. You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun. If you are not getting any enjoyment out of things here is something that people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such asYour favorite music or movie if there is just one movie you like watch it once or twice then find movies that are like it in some way with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety. This tells you about a number of helpful things including studentsagainstdepression. Org and other things for depressed students.

Are you saying that your friends have depression and anxiety? If so, then theyare using all their willpower just to continue existing? Bruh give them some slack and keep inviting them out. It probably makes their whole week everytime you guys chill. But maybe theyare worried about bothering you by asking to chill. Instead of waiting for you to invite them, you can reassure them that youd live to make some plans at their place sometime or tell them that they can hit you up sometime if they are lonely or make friendly banter about how you cant wait until one day they message you first so they know that you would enjoy it and not feel badly about taking up your time

Title: Ocd coincidence.
Thread
Guys I was watching a movie, and a thought come to my mind if im now watching movie minute and if this minute ends with number, for example, im watching movie part and it ends with confusion. That means my intrusive thought will occur. And it was real. I was in that minute then I thought it is just a coincidence, because it happens to me so often sometimes they are true sometimes not. It did not make me bad at all. Just a little anxiety. Then I sipped my tea and I realized a chocolate wrapper I do not. Now, if I used a correct wordconfusion I ate minutes ago, just moved. And then I accept it as a proove of minute coincidence. I do not even remember if I wanted a sign for number thing is true. I often do it, but now I do not remember I wanted this type of sign, but my ocd says you wanted, and guys, I was shocked. This chocolate wrapper moved and time while im watching it, there has no air circulations for making it move. Nothing at all. I didnt touched it either. Maybe I hallucinate. Even I wish it was just hallucination please help me. I cannot take it anymore. Do you think it is ocd or what? Every time ocd fucking ruin my day I cannot finish this movie today and nothing at all. Im so tired of this coincidences and ocd

The more you fantasize about it, the more likely it is to make an attempt, need to look at where those feelings come from, take care of them and make some changes it often a spiritual battle that does not require strength of body or energy. A depressive state is the body way of pumping the brakes and getting you in a position to take care of that. But all too often we do not ow what we are supposed to do once we are there I was raised to ignore my feelings and buy things to make myself feel better. The cumulative emotional debt resulting from such a culture nearly got the best of me

Not everyone with suicidal thoughts would actually commit suicide and it sucks to not have the courage to end one life or live it the way they want it a constant war and it is subjective of what wins.

My pronouns are they themconfusion? Ok, so an example. I was with my boyfriend. We were on the couch, I was on his lap. I didnt remember anything that had happened within the past or so hours. It was like I was waking up, but I hadnt fallen asleep. I know because when I wake up, I feel so tired, I almost pass out and im delirious. This was different. I looked up and I was wondering where I was. We were in the to room in the basement. It felt like it wasnt my house. Everything was familiar but not well known, like it was only my second time there. I spent a few minutes looking at the wall, wondering whose house I was in when I noticed my boyfriend, I assumed it was his house. I knew the facts I am myself, this is my of, and this is my house. But it didnt feel that way at all. I spent a few minutes thinking who I was, and when I figured it out, it didnt feel like I was myself. I just knew my name. I just new my bus name, the fact its my house. I almost forgot the way to my room. I sat up and looked around I saw a dog. I didnt know what she was, just her name, I pet her, but I was scared because she was unfamiliar. He asked if I was ok, and I just said, yes, I dont remember when, but at some timeHe kissed me, so I just kissed him back to avoid suspicion that I wasnt who I say I am. He asked if I could paint his nails before he left. So we went upstairs. Everything was really bright like a filter. My motor skills werent as good as usual. I barely talked. I only did if I had to, like. When my mom asked what I was doing, I painted his nails, and then he left. It was really weird. Everything was foggy, the world was getting brighter and dimmer, and to me, there was nothing else but the house. Anything outside of my view was a white void. It happend again. When I was going out for a smoke during lunch break. I walked away from my school and mid smoke. As I was walking, I was like, wait, who am i? This isnt russia? And then I just kept smoking and forgot everything past that.

I am no expert but I would recommend working to ground yourself a bit bare feet on the earth avoiding drinking smoking much breathing exercises its funky that our brains create our reality and at the same time can dismantle reality. Dont overthink it friend if it gets worse, go get some professional help and just feel it out with them maybe go get help now if that seems right in my opinion, the head can be like a sore back if you focus on it, there is a slim chance it gets better but doing a few stretches and relaxing can certainly help shift it in the right direction. Once again I am no expert professional so just take it with a grain of salt wishing you the best tho homie

It can be repressed. Memories and all subconscious tend to hold on those more than conscious mindconfusion, but that may not the case as well. I suggest talking to another therapist, preferably unrelated, unfamiliar with your current one and no mentionoftheir diagnoseconfusion. If it bothers you see if they come up with the same conclusion or not.

This comment tells you about simple things that can help with depression. The psychology today, article on depersonalization says grounding is one of the things that can help. I will give you some examples of grounding exercises eat a handful of raisins or nuts, very slowly, appreciating every piece, taking a long time to finish them. Being aware of your slow breathing, wash and dry the dishes very carefully focusing on what you are doing, the feelings in your hands and the sound of the water. Examine objects, pick up a few objects, name them, feel them and carefully inspect them, count things breathing slowly through your nose. Be aware of bodily sensations, the air passing through your nostrils, the feeling of your clothing on your skin, the pressure of the floor on the soles of your feet. Look around at the room, aware of the present moment, the here and now you cannot go wrong with stress management it something we all need. And it can help with anxiety and depression, especially when combined with the standard treatments. This has a lot of info

Depersonalization. Maybe that sounds really difficult. Do you have a history of mental health issues? Or is this something entirely new? If it is new, you should probably see a doctor because these could be health related symptoms.

Therapy for yourself. Remember, you cannot help anyone who does not want it some days we want help others. We have given up so completely. We do not believe anything can help. Bipolar is such an internal struggle. You really feel like different people or more, and are often unsure which is the real you forgetting its all us all the time. Just today, these traits are more prominent. We struggle with mindfulness endlessly. I commend you for sticking through this. It takes a big person and even if he does not see it everyday, I am sure he has great moments of gratitude, but does not share them out of guilt that you even go through this. His self absorption is affecting you. But I am sure it is not intentional. You need to sit down and tell him that your empathy for him is starting to linger in yourself too long. Caring for your grandmother has obviously triggered you understandably, you have just witnessed the possible development of your relationship and husband mental health in the future. This is why I stress therapy. They will help you find tools to cope and remind you to seek and claim your own safe spaces. They may also give you good support wording to better persuade your husband to continue therapy. That is truly how he will change meds make dealing with things easier, but they do not fix the problem

If this or anything remotely similar has only happened twice in your life, there is not much to worry about if the frequency increases, and you also begin to feel uneasy, paranoid, etc. I would definitely recommend seeing a professional as soon as possible about it.

Occasionally, I stutter a lot and have to repeat my words and eventually just give up, because I cannot talk. It kind of just goes up and down, like, sometimes I do stutter, then sometimes I don confusion. A lot of people cannot understand what I am saying and tell me to repeat myself. Anybody know what is going

Title: Mixed feelings about my boss asking too much of me while going through a hard time.
Thread
Hello, everyone. I guess I am here just to vent, but any and all advice is greatly appreciated. I have been working at my company for just over a year. Now we are a small company which has existed for the past or so years, specializing in translations. My boss started it with one other friend who does not work in the office anymore as of now, the company employs my boss, me and three other colleagues, one of which has been on maternity leave for the past year and a couple months and should be back this summer. Now, this employee used to spend hours in the office, and my boss world was shook when she left to have her baby. Around the same time she left, I came, and in a bit, over one month, I went from being a regular employee to my boss right hand. I handle translations projects, finances my boss personal stuff, you name it? I am probably doing it. When I started working, I was told that I would have to work hours a day, which I did for exactly one year straight. The promise, however, was that work hours would be flexible, and I could leave early after hours in the office confusion or have a day off whenever I wanted riight. My boss is older now in her, and she rarely stays in the office longer than hours, which is totally fine and not something I think of as a problem. The problem lies in her expectationsOf my working hours last december, I noticed that I was severely burnt out. I was constantly annoyed, tired, had zero motivation to do anything, and I started hating my job. I tried talking to my boss about it, but she did not really take me seriously, because she has been having a rough couple of months in january. I got very ill, and I was sick for nearly three weeks. I had to work every day, except on the day I got sick and called to say I might have couid. I did not have itconfusion during those three weeks. I asked my boss once again to shorten my work hours, and she told me to talk to my colleague and ask her if we could maybe split our hours so that we both work exactly hours. We did just that, and we agreed and signed on it. Confusion that I work from am to am for two weeks that worked really well. I felt better, more productive, more motivated to work. However, this morning, my boss came to the office after not being at work for a couple of days. Distressed and in tears for the past couple of months, she has kept me up to date with her private problems, which I never wanted her to share with me because it creates a weird working atmosphere, a bit too friendly in a negative wayconfusion this morning, she was totally out of it crying. And while telling me how hard of a time sheIs having basically begging me to stay in the office at least until am. I said nothing because her crying like that and begging me to be strong and take leadership reminds me of one very painful childhood trauma. But ultimately I said, ok, just to stop her crying. She left after an hour spent at the office to deal with something related to the problems in her personal life. And I took several trips to the bathroom to cry the mix of feelings out. I was feeling angry, sad and annoyed, angry at her for dropping it all on me, angry at myself for being angry at her because she is having a hard time sad and annoyed because I think that there is absolutely no need to work for more than hours. And I am again being forced to do. So after work, I texted her to see if it is really necessary to work such long hours or rather to let her know that things have been ok without me being in the office for more than eight hours long story short, she basically guilt tripped me into agreeing to it, telling me fine, I will manage. And thanks for everything. I figure it all out as if there is anything to figure out anyways. I do not know what the point of this post is. My thoughts are all over the place. I guess I just want someone to tell me it is ok to not want to work for more thanHours every single day and that she should not be dumping all her personal problems on me as if the stress of the job itself is not enough. And before anyone tells me to quit, I cannot do that. It pays super well much better than other workplaces in my profession pay and I am currently not in the position to be unemployed.

Title: I want my life to end, but I cannot, because it would destroy my mom.
Thread
Lately, I have got no energy, I am extremely exhausted, and I just do not see any point in living anymore. Immigrant life is hard. Finding my place in this life is even harder. I am years old, and my peers are already in their little bubbles, already working and living their best lives. And here I am cannot even secure a position. During the months of my job search, my parents and my family is in their home country. While I live in the usa, its brutal. I do not want to exist anymore. I am tired of waking up every morning just to think about all my problems and not being able to find solutions. My brain hurts, the stress is eating me alive, that my body physically hurts. I now often think about ending my life, but I am afraid if I fail, I will end up with a huge medical bill and drown myself in debt. Also, my mom, I know she misses me, and I miss her so much her finding out I am dead would destroy her. And I do not want that. Im just existing out of guilt at this point.

Title: I feel hopeless about relationships.
Thread
In a day or two, I am going to phone the doctors and explain my symptoms, so I can finally get help. I suspect I have bad, and I have done a lot of research over the past year or so, as it took me ages to finally tell somebody about the issue anyway, I am only so I am really young, but I watch this guy called do grande on it, and he does psychology videos. Whenever I watch his videos about bad, the comments are always really negative and make it sound like living with bad is honestly a death sentence. I know I have not actually been diagnosed, so maybe I am jumping the gun a bit, but I have researched literally everything else but bad is the only one that fits really well. So I worry I could genuinely have it. These comments just really put me down and make me feel hopeless for future relationships. What if I am that crazy ex? What if I am a terrible girlfriend having all these? What ifs and not knowing what I am actually like in a relationship really bothers me, especially with all these negative comments online, I just feel like I am doomed.

Self diagnosis is a really awful rabbit hole. I think you should watch youtube videos about complex ptsd, like the crappy childhood fairy, because folks with cptsd kind of look like borderline or bipolar, but they really are not as severe, not as chronic, not as difficult to find help to treat it, totally not at all like a personality disorder in terms of severity. I suggest this because I have known borderlines, and they are not really all that introspective as you sound. They have a completely different energy to them. Maybe you have bad. You will not know until you get an assessment, but I know that the ones I have met would not have written this post

Get diagnosed and then you can work with it if necessary bad is treated by therapy and is very treatable self diagnosis is a bad idea in every way with mental illnesses.

Is it normal to wanna literally die when in highschool its not just one thing the people the work loads the stress of expectations and the expectations of my parents it is just too much what the why is it so difficult I care about my future and I try hard in school and I get decent grades and I play video games with my friend but nothing makes me happy all the teenagers act like year olds posting cringe shit on tiktok and instagram and stuff I go to a private school but my family is not nearly as rich as theirs they flaunt their wealth not having to worry about grades or anything it is just all so fucking annoying someone help me
Comments
High school is not forever. Yes, it is normal to feel that way, but also no, it is not because you should not have to feel that way. Its not your fault. Being a teenager is so hard. Just try to stick it out. I promise once you leave and start working and making money for yourself, your life will begin again like a new chapter. Sounds silly, but trust me, I was very low in high school, too. I am lucky that my parents never pressured me. They let me study what I wanted and deal with my own consequences. I am really sorry to hear you are having a rough time

Title: Question from parent my teen still rocks before bed, full body, side to sideconfusion ink. Anything about this?
Thread
So ill keep this short, but I am trying to do a little research and find out if I need to intervene or if this is normal and I should leave him alone. He now but he is rocked full body. He will lay down on his back, close his eyes and rock back and forthconfusion since he was a toddler. I have heard of these things before, but he is now, and he confessed to me the other day that he has not gone more than days without rocking in the last years. Thats what concerns me the fact he cant stop. And hes admitted hes tried to many times also, he explains it like this dad, when I close my eyes and rock, its like I in my own little world and I can create or imagine anything I want, I am just wondering if I need to get him seen. Do I need to help? Or should I let him continue? After googling, I found some articles, but nothing about creating an imaginary world in his head while rocking. Any advice tips would be greatly appreciated, although he hates to go out in public or be around people hes quite normal on everything else

Honestly, and maybe it is a reach. It sounds like he may be swimming a great emotion regulation tool as well as for stimulation, etc. Confusion, rocking back and forth at night for bed, in conversations at school, all of which is okay to stim at. I think it may be beneficial to look into asd autism spectrum disorderconfusion traits, even if he is not neurodivergent. Plenty of neurotypical people exhibit neurodivergent traits.

Sounds like he is stressed out and coping with it by dissociative behavior and rocking. I would encourage him to find a therapist and offer to go with him if he needs. The support going into your own little world is a coping mechanism. It very similar to something I did as a kid. If the habit of dissociating continues into adulthood, it can become a primary coping habit, and in some circumstances, it hinders you I would wander off into thought before I knew it, and it had a negative impact on jobs I would get. I could not do restaurant work because it required me to be always on task, and my brain was not cooperating. To this day, I have caught myself wandering off and losing track of time. It a habit I regret having and wish I had caught it young. Not something to be alarmed about, but something that should be explored with a professional, I think,

I do not think there is anything wrong with that rocking on its own sounds perfectly healthy and a nice way for him to relax distress, be happy or anything else.

This sounds completely normal. We all have our own ways of self soothing and decompressing. Mine is nail biting. Some people masturbate, others smoke or drink it just his own way of coping with normal daily stressors. If he is not under extreme stress and he is a normal kid, then this isnt anything to worry about. Try not to embarrass him about it eventhough. Its quirky. He is just human, like the rest of us hope. This helps.

Title: I imagined a really sad scenario, and now it feels too real.
Thread
I live in a joint family, and I have mental health problems as well as my mom. She has undiagnosed ocd and is always cleaning the whole family, berates her for it, and I would get mad at her as well when she would inconvenience me by her cleaning. I know it is really selfish. I have no excuse for that. Couid made everything so much worse, and it is been getting really bad. My dad has constantly been yelling at her, and he never takes her side when anyone ever gets mad at her. I think she started disinfecting even more. A couple months ago, I was depressed, and I would constantly just get angry at her because I talked to her the most. One day, I said, you have a problem, not in a mean way, thoughconfusion, and she was like, I know I do, but I cannot help it. Everyone else is so normal and they can stop whenever they want, but I cannot help it. That broke my heart, and I never got angry with her again. A few days ago, my cousin got angry with her for cleaning his skin equipment and delaying him from going to his room, and he snapped at her. He got angry, imitated her and just made her feel humiliated. She came to my room crying, and I told her I would talk to him, but she did not want me to. She told his parents and they did not say much, because, I guess deepDown. They all agree. It is my moms fault for cleaning too much. Then my dad got angry with her in front of that cousin for cleaningconfusion and she felt humiliated again. So she said, you humiliate me like this so everyone else feels like they can as well. My dad took my cousins side because he gaslight her and said, it was not a big deal. I tried to talk to my cousin, but he ignored me, and I feel so helpless. I feel like I finally understand how she has always felt. When she said, I have no one. My heart hurts for her and it hit me so hard I could not stop feeling her pain. She tried to comfort me. She was holding disinfecting wipes in her hand and sobbing, saying, okay, il talk to you about how I feel later. I really have to clean now that broke me so hard because the world is so cruel to her. They did this to her. She had an arranged marriage at to someone who was years older than her. My dad was forced to as well, and he did not want to. He is a nice dad, but not the best husbandconfusion. She literally had no one. His sisters and sister in laws were so rude as well. Since she was really young today, I woke up laid in bed and imagined a scenario where she did take her life. She says she has nothing to live for, but she still doesBecause she feels like she has a duty to her husband and kids, even though we have all been horrible to her at some pointconfusion, I just got really deep into the scenario. I cried a lot. It was where my mom died, and I lashed out at my dads entire family for making her life so hard. I left my house and cut off everyone for good, except my sisterconfusion. Now, I cannot distinguish between the scenario and real life. My mom does not seem real. I should be grateful she is alive, but im still so sad. I guess I wanted to vent, but also get advice, because I feel like im crazy.

I have always struggled with suicidal tendencies, I think recently, I have just realized that there is got to be some way I can live in this world that is going to be better than how I live right now. If that means moving to fucking antarctica or getting high every day or playing video games or living in a daydream, then that is still a life that feels more worth living than dying. Go live at sea, live in the wilderness risk, ruining your life, doing something you believe will make you less miserable, at least before giving up. You have nothing to lose anyway, right? This might not be what you want to hear, but every method will be painful. If you fail, you might end up disabled in a coma, etc. After my half hearted attempt, I still ended up with side effects. I get random spells of vertigo that wont let me sleep. Itl be okay. Or some day will be better than today. If you need to talk, go ahead. Happy face or smiley hope I did not come off too harsh

Title: I hate those who say, find a hobby.
Thread
I once had a medium to severe case of depression. And looking back, what hurt me the most was the quintessential advice from friends, therapists and self help gurus find a hobby, do something you love, something you feel passionate about. Excuse me. But the very definition of depression is a lack of passion. When you are depressed, even things that you normally enjoy would feel bland. I used to enjoy music, dancing and workout, but when my episodes stroke, none of them felt remotely interesting. Eventually, I pulled myself out by studying everyday and finding a new job. One that did not try to kill me. None of the rosy do what you love. Yada is helped my friends. If you know someone who is depressed, please, considering suggesting something other than finding a hobby to a person who is suffering, it almost sounds like just feel better. Its like saying to a cancer patient, why do not? You just feel better confusion? Its at best lukewarm and at worst, heartless

In a ward I worked during placement. The rule was in place to prevent patients from further harm, such as using gambling apps, accessing harmful online communities, abusive or unhealthy relationships, uploading videos or photos of themselves to social media. For some people going through a manic episode, this can have an impact on their reputation and workconfusion and organising drugs or anything else to be brought in, which happens all the time, usually snuck inside food. It is also for privacy reasons, the privacy of the other patients, as well as the staff themselves. We would give them their phone when requested. Different people had different restrictions. Some could have their phone most the day, and others needed to be closely monitored, only being allowed to use the hospital phones for short periods.

And it can be frustrating, because then I have no way to talk with my friends or distract myself. I guess it is for privacy and focusing only on recovery without distractions. Instead, I know that in the uk and italy let you keep your phone with no problems. So confusion.

Many of these comments are very negative while it can be true for some wards not all are functioning with intention to harm you one of the biggest fuels for eating disorders is other people online as they are competitive disorders they cannot help you if you are consuming pro ana bodychecking food logging content online and it would be an invasion of privacy to check if patients were in the first place therefore the simple response is to not allow phones for other visiting reasons there are different reasons why a phone being taken can be justified

Title: I do not know what is wrong man standing.
Thread
I was doing good this morning. But then I went down to wash my face and looked at myself in the mirror for the first time today. And I do not think I am me. I do not know if I am making any sense, but I feel like I am in someone is body. All these memories are mine, but when I see myself, it is not me. Why does my face look so different from what I remember? I slowly keep getting numb and I do not like it. I keep zoning out and my heart feels like its going really fast, but really slow at the same time. It just keeps pounding really aggressively, and it is making me really uncomfortable.

Title: Apathy and desensitization.
Thread
I confusion, dont think I am mentally ill, or anything. I have never been evaluated besides school reports that almost always say the same thing. Good student agitated, good speaker. But in the last two years, I have felt like my brain has shutter down. A sense of apathy has been with me every day. Yes, I still have fun and sadness, but I have to almost force myself to feel like this. I cant play videogames. They are too boring. If I go out with friends, it will always be the same empty bullshit. Nothing is bringing me fulfillnes in this empty state of life. Nothing. And the worst part about apathy is that I have been feeling less apathy towards others, and I have been feeling like a jerk. I dont know if this is just a brain mechanism to protect my brain from the stress and death that we have been dealing in the last two years. But when a natural disaster or a crisis appear on the to, I dont feel sadness, anger. I just feel empty. And it is awful. This desensitization is making me turn into a selfish jerk, and I dont want this. I like other people, and I wish them well, and I know that times are, though, and shit, but it is almost like I can express this genuinely my apathy got worse on june when my grandma died. It was just days upon weeks of just numbness, and I feel as this numbness wont ever getAway from me.

Title: Burnout and mental paralysis.
Thread
Lately I have been finding that I feel like I cannot make progress at anything that requires longer term planning and prioritization. I allow myself to get tossed around by whatever other peoples urgent agendas are because it is easier to address something in front of me versus more forward looking and ambiguous. When I block time to focus, I have anxiety about the task of future planning and just want to sleep can anyone relate

Title: How do you help someone?
Thread
Hey, I have usually been the kind of person who deals with my anxiety and problems, mostly myself. And I do get help by researching about ways to calm myself down and getting help by myself as much as I can. Don get me wrong, I have a great circle of friends, and like I do reach out sometimes, if it gets real bad and many of them will listen, some will not know what to do, understandable, cause we are all just confusion, but they listen. And I am so fucking grateful for that. But most times I find that only I can help myself and try my best to sometimes. So getting to the topic, how do you help someone dealing with chronic stress or anxiety and panic all of a sudden, like cause of exams or some other shit like that? I try my best to listen to my best friends whenever they go through this and honestly, even if I am busy, I try cause for me that is what friendship is. But some people, when they are soo deep in the pit, they would call me to talk about it, and we do. But then they do not feel like doing stuff that would help them at that moment, you know, like writing down their feelings or meditation, breath work or anything like that. And you cannot force a person to do something unless they themselves bring themselves to do it. I do not blame them one bit. Cause in theDarkest of times. It can feel like nothing will help you out of the hole. I am so glad that specific person is atleast, reaching out when they are down. But how do you properly help someone who may not be able to help themselves right now, apart from listening to them and giving advices, how do you convince them to try out some of the methods to calm themselves down? Or should I even try to convince them? Or is there a better way I just want to take care of the people I love? I hate seeing them suffer. Thanks for reading through all this

Title: I feel like crying, but I cannot.
Thread
So for a very long time ive been feeling sad and empty recently I feel like im going to cry but it will not come out cause it is like im numb now I do not know how to explain it like when your have to sneeze, but you cannot and it is that annoying feeling. Ive also tried sad music and videos that would make me cry but it has not helped so far to I used to get high sober now and now I so there is that tooconfusion
Comments
This is kind of odd because I have been going through the same thing too confusion, same background of substance use. And so I have talked to my therapist about it, and what I have tried doing that helps sometimes is to really just sit and let the feelings wash over you relax and do not force anything understand that your feelings of sadness are okay. And if you can talk to a friend about it, usually, I tend to do this alone as crying around other people. As a guy makes me feel weak. Unfortunatelyconfusion. What also might help is trying to understand why you cant cry for me. It is because of the weakness aspect, and sometimes for others. Bottling it up is because they are afraid to get sad and act out self harm, dangerous behavior, etc. Confusionif. You can pinpoint what it is. It might give you some insight on what to do next, hope you feel better. Man,

Title: Why is mental health such a difficult uphill battle?
Thread
So I confusion was given the ultimatum of therapy or my relationship about months ago she told me I push people away when I get upset and had a extremely strong suicidal ideation that day I called and set up appointments through my work provided insurance the appointments were like months out but I took them as I was desperate to try and save my failing relationship long story short we broke up before the appointment came shockerconfusion I was kind of on the fences as to what to do about the therapy initially I wanted to cancel it because it was something I had been put up to by my now ex girlfriend I decided to stick with it considering she might have been right but then when I actually see the therapist she just kind of rehashed the same solutions for all of my problems they are not even really solutions either just statements accepting how shitty things are it also felt like we would only ever deal with surface level issues. It would feel like she would just kind of give me this runaround of small talk until it was minutes before my appointment ended she would say, oh no, were almost out of time. Maybe we can get into some more stuff next week I terminated that therapist after months. She seemed almost offended. When I did it told me she would talk to her manager and get me set up. Its been weeks and I have not heard anything. My mentalHealth is declining. So fucking fast, I am legitimately worried about myself, and it just feels like every support system I try to use spits me back out. I recently reached out to a teens clinic that says they offer free services, but they currently have a waitlist. I ask how long the waitlist is, and they tell me were trying to hire like that doesnt answer anything. I already know that if I finally get into a therapists office that it is a chance it is a shitty therapist. I am just over this whole trial and error with mental health, as it is been almost months, and I have just been ran in circles. I just want to throw my hands up and admit defeat.

Throw my hands up and admit defeat. So what does that mean? Suicide come on, man, you are only young, you have your whole life ahead of you. I am here to tell you my friend that nothing worthwhile in this life comes easily. The therapist has not gotten back to you, so pick up the phone and harass them, do not accept no for an answer. This is your mental health we are talking about here. So fight for it. There are wait times to see a therapist welcome to the world of the mental health system. Who fault are the failings in the health system. Your government. Remember this next time you vote assuming you are voting ageconfusion. There are no magic solutions to mental health. A lot of it comes down to effort on your part. And that is when you have a good therapist, the only person who can make these changes are you my friend. I wish you all the best with the journey

Honestly phones do not benefit most mentally ill pal it can cause depression, anxiety and such that one reason right there other reasons could be privacy for example say you had it phone and you recorded another patient without them knowing invasion of privacy not only that but anything you recorded there that could be the businesses personal information there is really a lot of reasons if you sit and think about it could be used as a weapon too really lol.

At least in the us, psych wards are often involuntary. They are more like incarceration than treatment unless it is private.

I personally think it is damage control just in case the staff ends up being caught doing something messed up to the patients that we cannot record them and post that crap online. Not all rules are meant to help the patients.

I see it like this. A lot of people with mental health issues feel pressure or get harassed online mean twitches, calling an anorexic girl fat or a fat girl a whale exes, blasting you or even just googling and obsessing over pics of people with perfect bodies.

Reading many of these comments, and they all seem to be negative, so I will go the other way with maybe a fresh perspective. A psych ward is a controlled environment with the intention of providing a supportive and relaxing situation in which you can get help. Now, I know many psych wards do not live up to that standard, and of course, there are issues sometimes, but overall, this is the goal. Having your phone allows a person a connection to outside variables that can cause issues and stress people out more than they need to be, especially since again, they are supposed to be getting help and not worrying about outside pressures. I believe many wards do allow for phone calls that are monitored. I know that, but they should be, so the staff knows about issues the patient is going through. I do not think personal phones should be allowed in a psych ward at all.

Because for some of us, it is just a way to stay exposed to our triggers which will make our being in there pointless, like if we are being abused at home and said, abuser just keeps calling and messaging that not very helpful towards recovery is it. And cell phones are a massive source of stress for everyone, even if you do not realize it, being stressed out all the time will just exacerbate any emotional psychological symptoms.

Hi, I am sorry, you are not feeling well. Being sick can be tiring and lonely. I can assure you, if you talk to almost anyone, they will help you do not want to die, or at least your true soul doesn you would not be reaching out if you did. Can you try to tell that cruel voice in your mind to stop lying to you? Try to listen to the one who reminds you, even if you feel no one else loves you, always have you. And love does not have to always be deep and or forever. You make a difference to the people you smile at on the street, the animals you pet, hello, people you have gone to school or work with that had a bad day, and you were nice to without knowing or reason. If you would like to message me, I would like to try and find some local resources to help you, but I need to know your general area. I am not going to lie to stranger and say, I love you, but I know someone does, and you should, too. Let me know if you would like me to try and find someone to help you do that

Title: It just life right

Honestly, I hear this statement. Its just life so much when I try and explain how I feel to my parents or others. I am a year old australian confusion, who has very little to look forward to in life, even though I have a job and going to uniconfusion while I think about how shit life is and how I want to be dead, I am too scared to do anything. I want to stay for my partner. I get it if I want shit, I have to work. I need money to be able to live right now. Im in university. That also isnt great, but I rather study than work as I grow older. I realise how little there is to life. Wake up, go to work, come home, eat, when needed sleep. Yes, each day can be different and things can happen, but like, is there a point? I seriously cannot comprehend it. I have a good job with employers who annoy me so much and have treated me badly. I legit will cry and am exhausted all the time. But thats life, right? How? Why is it so shit? I fucking hate it. Why do I have to deal with this shit? But its just life, right? Its always that fucking statement. I hate it with a passion. Maybe I should just die, cause I cant deal with shit. I put my family and friends through enough. I can never explain without impacting them too much? Im too much I justHave an issue and cant fix it currently on a help line for an hour and no one has picked up. Why is it like this? Why is it shit I am tired and want to give up but I cannot cause I have things. I want to stay for its constant stay alive or die, stay alive or die. Its painful.

I am a year old australian confusion, who has very little to look forward to in life, even though I have a job and going to uniconfusion while I think about how shit life is and how I want to be dead, I am too scared to do anything. I want to stay for my partner. I get it if I want shit, I have to work. I need money to be able to live right now. Im in university. That also isnt great, but I rather study than work as I grow older. I realise how little there is to life. Wake up, go to work, come home, eat, when needed sleep. Yes, each day can be different and things can happen, but like, is there a point? I seriously cannot comprehend it. I have a good job with employers who annoy me so much and have treated me badly. I legit will cry and am exhausted all the time. But thats life, right? How? Why is it so shit? I fucking hate it. Why do I have to deal with this shit? But its just life, right? Its always that fucking statement. I hate it with a passion. Maybe I should just die, cause I cant deal with shit. I put my family and friends through enough. I can never explain without impacting them too much? Im too much I justHave an issue and cant fix it currently on a help line for an hour and no one has picked up. Why is it like this? Why is it shit I am tired and want to give up but I cannot cause I have things. I want to stay for its constant stay alive or die, stay alive or die. Its painful.

Thanks for sharing how you feel. I think that people resort to clicks like it is what it is when they do not know what else to say. It sounds like you have a lot going on with both uni and work. So it makes sense to me to resign from your job to focus on school. Here is another clich, which I will apologize for in advance. Have you talked with a doctor or therapist about how you are feeling?

Title: Jealousy.

Hello. How can I overcome jealousy thanks in advance.

It is fine if you do not want to elaborate. But you first must identify what makes you jealous from there, realize what you can and cannot control from that scenario for myself, my dad would often compare me with certain people, which in part made me jealous. There was very little I could do in those scenarios, and I think unconsciously, I began to give him more reason to make the comparison. I will be honest. If you did elaborate, I am not sure what answer I could give you. Its important to be consciously aware of these emotions, and as long as you did act on this one without forethought, you should be alright. I remember the jealousy turning into anger for myself on a few occasions, and it being very ugly. If you can control the situation that causes the emotion, then do. But if you find yourself not being to control the situation, then it is, sadly, to bear through the emotion when it comes and think a little further before you act, jealousy is a horrible emotion leaves you feeling disgusting with yourself. Afterwards. I recall in many situations, when everyone is enamored with the person of comparison. I would sneak out and go for a walk, and guess what? No one noticed. It can get lonely, though,

You sound normal for a person who believes conflict is bad. In my opinion, conflict is good because its shows one cares. And when both care, you have relationship and relationship is the most important thing.

Yes, fights feel horrible in this way, but usually until they get resolved and talked about. Once we go over our grievances and our feelings and apologize to each other than it is a lot better, has your fight been resolved yet?

Hey, thanks for posting it sounds like there is a lot going on at the moment, and that is okay. Fights are not nice, especially when you have mentioned that you are predisposed to anxiety. They can leave you feeling awful about yourself. The other person involved and can extend to other unrelatedconfusion areas of your life. It can be really difficult to get out of your head, as you have mentioned in your post, when things are still raw in the immediate aftermath. The most effective way to determine if something is in your head is to ask. I know it might seem scary because it is reopening what was clearly a difficult episode in your relationship, but it is really important to articulate the way you feel, that way your boyfriend can articulate his own views on the situation and make sure you are not second guessing the way he feels. It important to do this in terms of the way it makes you feel, rather than in terms of what he said did. And making what you are saying sound accusatory. You be opening up communication and talking about how you feel how you care and want to move forward. And how to do this is this something you feel you are able to

And I am to remember that everyday, everytime I put the makeshift rope around my neck to try again every time I fail again, every time I scratch my wrists, legs and waist, till it is all red. Everytime I have to wait until it fades away. Every time my mind yells, screams at me to just die. I am my own problem, and I hate it. I wish I could blame it on my mum, who constantly gaslit me and yelled at my father and I throughout my childhood or on my friend who manipulated me into feeling unable to leave her, because if I do, I will have no one and everyone would choose her or on my brother, even who claims he is just absolutely done with me and all my dumb issues and diagnosed depression. I wish I could blame it on someone, but I can, because I am already out of those situations and will most probably never be in them again. Now, it is just me, the one who has close to a suicidal thoughts a week who sometimes tries to act on those thoughts. Me who, knowingly does not tell my father who is just trying his best to help me just to try to not end up in a mental hospital. Me who is terrified of what will happen to me once I do die, because surely, someone such as I could never have a good afterlife. I know that I need help. I know I probably belong,In a mental hospital for all the times, I try to suffocate myself to death, backing out only because of fear of repenting to god for killing myself.

You re braver than most people I know for coming out with this. I am proud. Bro also, quick advice. Reality is our understanding of it, how we take it is how we live. And I know its hard to just get your head out of the gutter.

Title: Unsure if I should take a mental health day today.
Thread
So a little background. First, I have always had issues with anxiety, mainly when I was younger, didn know that is what it wasconfusion that got better as a young adult. And now in my mid, and it has reared its ugly head again with me having my first ever panic attack while I was driving home from work last year. I also did therapy for years with the va a few years back, and that seemed to help a ton. How does this relate to my question? Well, right now, I have been up for hours because I cannot shut my mind up. I have got class in hours and a hour work shift about hours after I get out of class today, I have been stressed to the max, and I do have a week, long vacation from work coming up, coinciding with spring break. So there is hope, but right now, I just unsure what to do here. I rarely ever call off from work, and I never miss a day of class at the same time. I am aware of where I am mentally right now, and I know it is not a good place. Any suggestions edit. I decided to take the day off. I do a fairly decent job of taking care of myself physically, but today, I decided to take care of myself mentally

Or maybe im just too sensitive. Okay, so good news. I took a bath the second I woke up today. The bad news is that in the middle of it, I was told it was time to eat, and it had to be rushed. Then, after finishing eating, I went back to a teacher grading me a for an assignment which hadnt even reached the due date yet. Then, after minutes of privacy, I was forced by my parents to watch some weird hour movie that has an unrelenting amount of sex scenes and triggered my intrusive thoughts hard. Then right after that, they tell me to leave the door open between their room and my room, giving me no privacy at all. Then I open tiktok in hope for some comfort and get greeted by a video of my friend going out with that friend that was so fucking rude to them. Soo many times, what will it take? Huh? The minute I try to be a better person, something in life, randomly, comes up. I hate this. I fucking hate this. People are going to tell me to be better, be better, then get on my ass whenever I even try. And the worst part is, I cant even be mad at those people. My friends just living their life, and my parents just wanted to spend time with me. They didnt even know it had sex scenes. Why cant I be happy if everyone around me is trying so goddamn hard? Its soAnnoying. I just want to be happy again. Whats the point of trying to be good when the day goes against you for it? When god would send one thing after another to try and stop you from doing so, tell me,

I did not read anything wrong, bad that you did in there that needs to. He done better. You sound lovely. You sat through a hour movie for your parents and even ended your bath short to make breakfast on time. It normal to be upset by inconveniences, like the bath ending early or enduring a movie you are not interested in or watching friends make an annoying decision. You did not react poorly because you were feeling bad. And that is very mature. That being said your parents sound like they require a lot of time and attention from you. The lack of privacy is also concerning. Are you able to talk to your parents and tell them you love them and want to spend time with them? But sometimes you just do not feel up for it, like if activities could have be planned together, including your input, hopefully, your parents are receptive to that bow. What matters more than the grade is the effort you put in to it? Id you are still not able to understand a topic than you can request some help from your teacher. You re already doing. Great life happens sometimes, and it is okay to feel upset by it. You do not owe anyone happiness, but yourself

Title: Anyone have experience with setting up lights for mental health boosting.
Thread
Hey, everyone. I have been looking into getting more lights for my room after staying with relatives for a bit after being isolated and falling into a deep depression for a bit. I noticed that having a bright, warm light helps a lot for me, at least when I got home, I immediately went to turn on my led strips to a yellow, orange color, and I try to have it on as much as possible before. My room used to be very dark. I live in a really old house, so I do not have any overhead lighting. Other than the strips I had to. Less than professionally install, I still find that the strips are not enough sometimes, and I am not really experienced with electrical work bulb installation. Anyone have experience with doing stuff like this. I have a bedside lamp, but it only shines the same boring blue, and I would really prefer something brighter. And from above, any advice is helpful. Thanks a lot.

Title: I think I need idris. What is your experiences?
Thread
Hi, all I have been taking saris on and off for most of my adult life for depression. They certainly do help my depression, but I have always felt like they are slapping a bandaid over undiagnosed adhd that fuels my depression over actually addressing it. I am currently on the waiting list for a formal diagnosis, after my doctor suggested it after listening to my symptoms, and I am due for a review of my sari medication. I want to suggest moving to an nori to see if that makes life more bearable than constantly cycling on and off saris. What are your experiences with idris
Comments
I have always felt like they are slapping a bandaid over undiagnosed adhd that fuels my depression over actually addressing it is getting diagnosed for adhd possible to determine if your self diagnosis is accurate. Overall, sari and nori have similar mechanisms of action. The key is to find the right drug that works for you with the least amount of side effects. Its certainty worth looking at other options. Sometimes even a different sari can produce significantly better effects than something that was previously ineffective. Good luck.

Title: Balance.
Thread
I have been a consumer of mental health services for the past years ishconfusion. My life felt like one big drama after the next, and my utilization of services very much reflected the changes. If there was something bad happening, I needed more time with a therapist that not a terrible dynamic, but it did not do anything to change my feelings of powerlessness. It very much still felt like I was chained to the past. I cannot control that my family dynamics have always been unhealthy. I cannot change the trauma. I cannot change the substance use, homelessness, poverty or just harmful behavior toward others. For a long time. I have lived differently. But man, that is terrifying. It felt like I had to explain and justify my actions, and it felt very much like I had to question myself each time something big happened. And I put up some boundaries and in an environment of anxiousness, low self confidence and a pervasive, negative view. It was very much like gaslighting myself. So I have been refocusing my energy, focusing on only offering explanations. When I want to preserve some part of the relationship. It involved a great amount of introspection, weighing risks, benefits and honesty about my own motivations and underlying needs. And I stopped expecting things from others that they cannot give, and started looking for other ways to get my needs met. That freed up the time I have to focus on other values diet, nutrition, growth in the fulfilling relationships, humanConnection and growth in my career. This feels like balance. I can feel the roots growing. I am not an oak tree yet, but I will be.

Different people have different worldview and coping mechanisms, and for the most part, the only thing they have to deal with how your illness affects them at the end of the day, you are the one who need to cope with how your illness affects you. That is true for a lot of things, though also do not think it is a stretch to say that we do not know how this connected generation is going to be affected by the subcultures surrounding mental illness on the internet. To many people, it is not weird to put your diagnosis in your bio. I have definitely been a lurker and poster in subs like this and other websites since I was in middle school and ink how that is affected me

Do we want to talk about philosophy, ego and identity are sort of needed to enact a concept of free will. Without either there is just a void and a lack of basis to make decisions on even decisions based on cause and effect, are driven off, desire or avoidance of an end result. One can say we are the sum of our environment. Where is meaning or consciousness in that you are free to define yourself as you will. I hope it is in alignment with your goals, and I hope your goals are constructive. If one gets very wrapped up in a sense of identity surrounding mental illness, it can manifest as a victimhood mindset. What is your next thought? Can you say what it is without actually having the thought, maybe to a degree, we are not in full control of who we are. Doesn that make you mad? So the world told you how you are supposed to be and who you are is the result of programming that is a rejection of free will as a concept. Do you want to call yourself a robot? So from a libertarian standpoint that despite all that, I have made a decision to ascribe value to things in alignment with my goals and desires I have haphazardly also defined. After coming to that conclusion, I will opt to have my ego defend my basis of decision making. Long story short, we are free to act how we want to act, live with the consequenceIncluding judgements, rewards, punishments. There is liberty in that.

I heard this a lot in therapy, and while I understand the logic behind it, that does not mean I stop feeling or identifying with that illness in a way. After all, it has done nothing but follow me for life, and in a way has become that darker part of my psyche and self.

I think it kind of depends on what you are dealing with. For example, depression is a curable mental illness, even though sometimes really hard to cureconfusion. But for example, depressive personality disorder is not curable and is not an illness, rather a disorder which describes your personality. Still, these kind of disorders can be treated, but it is always going to be there, but you can limit the symptoms of it so you will function better overall.

Title: A little advice if you are feeling stuck.
Thread
You have been there before and you thought the same that there is no solution or conclusion. But here you are today, moving on from one level and playing an other level of this game, just pointing this out, life is neither too good nor too bad. It okay to take the world as it is there. A difference between self negative talk and self actualization. Self actualization is about the realization or fulfillment of one talents and potentialities not to be confused with self negative talk. It okay to embrace who we are that is not being negative. In the end, the competition is endless. It okay to accept ourselves. It okay to let go. You do not have to carry all this burden by yourself. I am with you, and so are many, countless others. We re not alone. Our lives will never be perfect, but they can still be just as beautiful, if not more. It okay to accept that life is random there, pain and there is joy. Amp there is no one without the other. Pain is inevitable, but the suffering is optional. Let make something better out of what we have. Happy face or smiley

Title: Ply help severe death health anxiety for past weeks
Thread
Hi this is my first post on here. For the past weeks I have had severe death anxiety for me and my loved ones before this anxiety started me, and my family had omicron. It was not severe for any of us. But that did not stop me from worrying. I would constantly search what symptoms meant or look up the death rates or how much it was spreading. We got over it weeks ago, but there were lingering symptoms that we experienced, and that is when this anxiety started, I had a elevated heart rate, and it made my anxiety sky rocket. I had panic attacks while trying to go to sleep. I would spend hours searching the web for details about omicron to the point it was obsessive. Ive always had some sort of anxiety, whether it be social anxiety or anxiety, for simple things, like public speaking, not diagnosed of. When I was younger, I did suffer from separation anxiety from my mom. I literally had panic attacks when I was not near her. It eventually went away and growing up, I occasionally thought about losing my parents, and I would cry myself to sleep. I also have some form of ocd. It is not diagnosed, but I do remember having to touch something amount of times before I could go to sleep. But the anxiety has been so bad these last weeks that it is all I think about. I cry about it everyday. Just thinking about losing them. I get badIntrusive thoughts about it to where if I try not to think about it comes back worse I am obsessively looking up everything about death anxiety and thanaphobia I have cannot seem to sleep right nothing is helping at all it to the point I feel I am losing control of my mind and I feel like giving up I do not have the financial resources for a therapist nor do I have insurance to go to the doctor ply is there anyone out there struggling with what I am going through and if so, can you please help me get over this

Hi. I do not have experience with this, and obviously you need to see a professional as soon as you can, but I can offer you unprofessional advice. Suggestions have you been sleeping? Okay? Dreams help us process our fears. But if you are too stressed to sleep properly, you need to focus on bringing down stress levels to a more manageable level. First of all, is there a way you can come to terms with death? I have anxiety over losing my loved ones too, but it is inevitable, and only the people left behind suffer, like what would make you feel better. Having them know how much you love them and spending as much time together as possible. Well make time to see your families as much as you can maybe buy, make them all something and attach a note that tells them how important they are to you. Sometimes just talking out loud about fears. With someone helps ease the burden. Writing your fears down helps your brain process them too. Just find anything you can to help reduce some tension there. You should also google something called the relaxation response by do hoover. It is basically meditation. But he studied the physiological response to it basically like the reverse of what happens when we are stressed. It is a way to calm the body down. So it knows not to calm down too. Magnesium helps a ton to relax. Just look foe something that is gentle on the stomach, or you canGet from food sources, hemp seeds, almondsconfusion, do you have anyone? You can go out and do things with? I, stayed at home, literally never leaving the house until they let us know outdoors is generally safe. So I went to the beach, ate at restaurants with outdoor seating, and all that made me realize that it is not as scary as I made myself believe. Just going out talking to pal made such a huge difference for me. I think going outdoors even id it is a solo hike or beach trip, will help pull you out of that dark thoughts place. I hope you are okay, and you find some relief

Title: I am losing my mind and my salary.

How do you explain to your work place that you are mentally not in the state to go to work right now that you have just had an anxiety attack, that you have not been able to sleep well for days that you have severe social anxiety, but you have toughed it out and worked for a month. But in, if you go out, you might shut down that there is so much on your mind. And none of it is good that you just need day, even if abruptly, just to calm down and pull it together for another month of work. I come from a place where talking about mental health for men is a sign of weakness. Generally, we do not talk about it little to no resources to get help. So those of us like this just bottle it up and live through it daily.

I straight up told my boss I asked to have a meeting with her, one on one, and it is very important, a tldr of what I said was, heres what is been going on in my life, and it is affecting my performance. I have taken xyz steps to get it addressed, and I had no issue. I have tenure at the company, and I believe that was a contributing factor to the success of the conversation.

I feel you, boss, man, it is hard out there for us dudes, frankly, the strongest and manliest thing you can do is own it. You also do not owe your work any kind of loyalty unless they are understanding of issues like this. Otherwise, it is just a transactional relationship. And one where, on that particular day, the transaction of however much they pay you is outweighed by the need to care for your self. Fuck them, but at least give them the courtesy of letting them know you will not be there. I highly doubt they would do the same if they were planning on letting you go. So do not stress it. Take your day, my boy,

You say that you have a problem with motivation below advice for motivation people in various countries say that they can often find the books I mention with amazon kindle or google books this is a comment that a reddit member in india who was suffering from depression responded to very positively this I think is the best advice you can possibly get for making friends it a quote from a book that is been a best seller for generations videoconfusion it much easier to make friends by becoming interested in other people than by trying to get other people interested in you good listeners are always welcome flattery will get you nowhere but a sincere compliment now and then can work wonders, especially when somebody is feeling down it all about sincerity be seriously interested in what the other guy says.

Title: I cannot shower, cook meals or get out of my bed weary face.
Thread
I am stuck, like, really stuck. I experienced a lot of stress and had a breakdown, then got couid, had my period and another breakdown, and it is broken me since november last year, I have spent most of my days in bed. I do not cook anymore. Do not eat breakfast, lunch or dinner, I just eat snacks all day, like crisps, chips, crackers, noodles, brownies, hot dogs. And that is it? Really? I have not lost any weight doing this. Really, I am actually the heaviest I have ever been in my life. I do not really shower much either or brush my teeth anymore. It feels like too much work and effort, and I would rather stay in bed where I feel comfortable and safe. Mostly, the thought of having a shower repulses me. I do not really dress in nice clothes anymore either. I just go out in tracksuit bottoms and a jumper. I cannot get out of this. I cannot get into routine of showering regularly. I cannot push myself to cook proper food. I buy food from the shop to cook, but it always ends up going rotten, because I never cook it. I just cannot push myself. Most days, I just think, ah, screw it, I do not care. And other days, I do not even think about showering or eating or think about the fact I have not washed for a week. I just do not care anymore. I see no reason to shower or cook because iSimply do not care. I know that when I shower, eat, well care for myself. It makes me feel better happy. It lifts my mood and gets me out of that hole. But even knowing this, I still do not do it. I do not do this simple thing, which will improve how I feel. I just accept my sadness and give into my depression. I need to get back into a routine. I know at first it will seem hard, work, not enjoyable, an effort, something I will not like, but I will eventually relax with it and enjoy it, and it will be easy and make me feel better. But I just cannot get myself started. I spend one night pampering myself, dying my hair, putting on a face mask, showering, shaving, and I realise how much it is, lifted my mood and made me happy and tell myself, I have another shower tomorrow. Or I put on a face mask the next day and have a shower the day after, and have showers every other day. Because I think if I push myself to shower everyday, I stop doing itconfusion. But once tomorrow comes, I am back in bed, not wanting to shower, not wanting to do anything. I do not know what to do. I am feeling kind of helpless and desperate for a cure to this. I want to snap my fingers and stop feeling this way and get back into a routine. I need help to get better. I needHelp to know what to do. I am desperate to get out of this hole and get back to being clean and eating and wanting to cook, but I honestly do not know what to do or how to get out of this. I just cannot get out of bed. I have no reason to. I am unemployed because of my mental disorders and disabilities, and I have no purpose anymore. Like, why should I get out of bed? Why should I shower? It does not bother me not washing. So what is the point in doing it? Ahh! I am so stuck.

I can tell you some self help things, but I am not saying necessarily that these are all you need treating a serious case of depression with nothing but self help is risky. A famous psychiatrist, abraham low, said that when we cannot control our feelings, we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed, they will obey, count down from and at zero, move with all your might try this when it seems that you are too tired to work, lie on the couch, close your eyes and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for minutes. Think in terms of taking it step by step and starting with something really easy. Taking things in baby steps. Very important. This is the key to motivation, and motivation is the key to recovery. Just min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually. So long as you do not make yourself sick of exercise with too much. This is a motivation trick that is been used in behavior modification programs, since the if a task seems like it is too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy cleaning. Start by cleaning for, or min, and take a min break. Homework, start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you are going to read by looking at headings, sub headings, etc. YouCan even use the baby steps principle for having fun if you are not getting any enjoyment out of things. Here is something that people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there is just one movie you like watch it once or twice, then find movies that are like it in some way with similar story or the same actor. Keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety. If you are thinking about professional help. Treatment usually begins by seeing the go, who can give you a referral? I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have, such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life, affecting how you feel if you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support also traditional asian methods

Start small set, a reminder to do one thing, whether it is taking a shower, getting out of bed, whatever, do one thing, then start adding more. You will have to do what it says and not think, eh, you have to interrupt that thought, because it is probably behavioral right now. By that, I mean, recognize when you have that thought and do not listen to it instead, think, no, it is something that I have to do. Getting out of a loop requires action. And sometimes you are the one that has to do it, and it can be hard, but you know it can help, and you can do it

I wish I could tell you that there is an easy answer or some trick to fixing this. I cannot, because there isnt. What I can tell you is that there is hope. I have a friend who almost mirrors your story. And after a lot of struggle and hard times, she is doing better. So pulling through is possible and for what it is worth, I may not know you personally, but I absolutely think you have great value and are worth struggling for best of luck.

Or I put on a face mask the next day and have a shower the day after, and have showers every other day. Because I think if I push myself to shower everyday, I stop doing itconfusion. But once tomorrow comes, I am back in bed, not wanting to shower, not wanting to do anything. I do not know what to do. I am feeling kind of helpless and desperate for a cure to this. I want to snap my fingers and stop feeling this way and get back into a routine. I need help to get better. I needHelp to know what to do. I am desperate to get out of this hole and get back to being clean and eating and wanting to cook, but I honestly do not know what to do or how to get out of this. I just cannot get out of bed. I have no reason to. I am unemployed because of my mental disorders and disabilities, and I have no purpose anymore. Like, why should I get out of bed? Why should I shower? It does not bother me not washing. So what is the point in doing it? Ahh! I am so stuck.

Title: Possible trigger warning depression, suicidal thoughts and imaginaryconfusion blood warning.
Thread
It feels good to drown in the depression and suicidal thoughts, but at the same time, I hate it, and it is scary, and I want it to go away. I am wanting to die while at the same time, extremely afraid of pain and death. I also have no motivation for anything I want to do so much. I have a huge list, confusion. But instead, I procrastinate whether that is playing a video game on my switch or staying in bed, ink why? But I have always been lazy and find shortcuts. I always do important things. At the last moment, I give up easily, but I swear it is gotten worse. In the past few years, I feel worthless and like a burden, but I am too lazy to do anything about it. Why am I like this? I have never been the best at remembering and organizing things, but again, I swear it is gotten worse. These past few years, I can decide to do something, or someone gives me an instruction. But I forget, like, seconds later, I have a difficult time listening to following and remembering instructions and occasionally, even just normal conversations, stories. This frustrates my mom. But more so it makes her sad. I do not listen to her. I not trying to ignore her. It kills me to do this to her without being able to fix it. I do not know how to fix any of it. On top of all this, I do not evenTake care of myself or take some fricking responsibility. Our cats suffer because I both forget and do not have the motivation to clean the catboxes. I cannot ask someone else to do them, because my older brother, who is the primary candidate to do them, often has already had a long, exhausting work day. And it is unfair to do that to him. My dad also worked hard all day, and cats are not his favorite. He likes ours, okay? But anything we can do to keep it. That is good lolconfusion. My mom has bad knees as well as expectations as she should be able to have for her year old leech, aka meconfusion. I can only keep my cat if I take care of her. And one of the biggest expectations for me kitty care is to clean the letterboxes. I love my little goober so much I do not want her to go away. The rest of the family has also fallen in love with her, and I be on their death lists if we have to get to rid her, because, as previously mentioned, I do not do so confusion. Ha! I love feeling clean and taking good care of my body, but at the same time, it feels good to be dirty. My outside match the inside. I am lazy. I cannot explain it either. I am a burden that is leeching off money, food, water and love from my favorite people leeching it when there are millions who needIt desperately, but nope, my fat, sits around and contributes absolutely nothing. They have to save me a lot because of my stupidity. I have my whole life ahead of me that terrifies me if I am this screwed up at only then, how much worse will it get? How many obstacles and tough situations will I face? Sometimes I love to picture sneaking out during night and killing myself. I mostly picture scenarios. The first is getting a gun and blasting my head to smithereens. All that is left is a bloody corpse. I live in the rockies. So for my second thought, I walk to a somewhat distant, quiet field during a cold, maybe even snowy night. I lay down and wait for hypothermia to take me. It horrifying. I hate it. I am having tears come out while I type this essay, and there is an empty and dark yet crushing feeling in my chest. It am here and I need to sleep. I can. I feel too awake. But of course I sleep in, and nothing gets done. Thanks for reading this far. I am sorry if I wasted your time. Woman shrugging, medium, light skin tone

Title: People are reluctantly socializing.
Thread
Around of people are introvert but why there are lots of people outside this makes me think that people are reluctantly socializing
Comments
Yes and no. Initially, when making friends acquaintances, there is a small hope deep inside looks for fellow humans in time. If we find matching interests and desires, we will in time meet not out of reluctance but out of interest. Some long time friends may be appearing to reluctantly engaging due to the change in nature of engagement we have for some time due to the pandemicconfusion communicating to each other from the comfort of our couch, and things are changing back slowly. We probably could end up communicating remotely, but I think that would be sad, and we should all give an effort to restore normality again and meet often just to clarify the difference between introvert and extroverts. In that there focus is either generally more external or internal. We should not think an introvert is someone that is socially awkward or vice verse. I would say I am extroverted, but it still does not mean that enjoy sitting alone at home, an introvert may and can spend huge amounts of time with an extrovert out and about simply because the extrovert encourages the other persons introversionconfusion.

Lately I have been feeling like shit and went back into a depression state again. I met this girl a couple weeks ago, and now I am realizing that she is not the one for me after falling for her and I cannot get her off my mind. I feel so hurt and broken because of this. I have been boxing for almost a year now and have a fight coming late march, but it is hard to concentrate on that with this on my mind. I really just want a girl that will be by my side and someone I can love. I love myself and feel like I am ready for someone else to enter my life

If you have access to it and it does not make you disassociate, you can replace your regular weed with cod flowers. You still get the ritual of smoking that way.

The fact is that your generation are living through a major extinction event whilst being made to carry on with living the lie as the adults do. So let me just make this absolutely crystal clearkiss. It amazing that you are still breathing, let alone eating, tidying, cleaning, learning, etc. Knowing what you know, the burden you carry, the lack of empathy you receive as a result of them closing their feelings off, which threatens to harm them if they do skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant one day in the distant future. The way we talk of war time victims shall be applied to you. Victims of an insane culture of intransigence, rapacity, an inherent lack of love, skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant. You make damn sure to get up, live, to tell the world about these struggles when the future is ready to acknowledge their existence. Listen to their soul destroying effects, wink or smirk. You are not wrong. The world is. And I feel proud to have such a brave generation of newer, more connected human beings. Pave the way for a kinder, more intellectual future. You give yourself a pat on the back for every day you take in your stride. Happy face smiley. If you make a movie of the present day, culture in the future, it be a horror film. Jacque fresco,

Yes, there is an advantage to having people who congratulate us even so we can congratulate ourselves when no one else does. Also, psychologists have been working on ways to help with motivation for many years, and these things work, if you like to journal note the times when you slip up but do not dwell on them, emphasize your successes big and small. A lot of things can help standard treatments and self help advice from experts in my comments, a famous psychiatrist, abraham low, said that when we cannot control our feelings, we can still control our muscles if you tell your arms and legs to get you out of bed, they will obey, count down from and at zero, move with all your might. That principle works with taking showers, etc. Try this when it seems that you are too tired to work, lie on the couch, close your eyes and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for minutes. Think in terms of taking it step by step and starting with something really easy. Taking things in baby steps. Very important. This is the key to motivation, and motivation is the key to recovery. Just min of brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually. So long as you do not make yourself sick of exercise with too much, this is a motivation trick that is been used in behavior modification programs, since the if a task seems like it is too big, think of itAs a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy. Cleaning start by cleaning for or min, and take a min break. Homework start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter. You are going to read by looking at headings, sub headings, etc. You can even use the baby steps principle for having fun if you are not getting any enjoyment out of things. Here is something that people here have said is helpful with that problem. Look all over and do a complete inventory. You should be able to find at least one or two things you like, such as your favorite music or movie. If there is just one movie you like watch it once or twice, then find movies that are like it in some way with similar story or the same actor, keep adding to your entertainment supply to give it variety. If you are thinking about professional help. Treatment usually begins by seeing the go. Who can give you a referral? I mention referral, because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day. Any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life, affecting how you feel. If you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, thatThere are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also traditional asian methods.

Title: Am I a dick for wanting to cut a friend off forever?
Thread
New account. This whole last year has been a journey for me with mental health, ive grown leaps and bounds and still have a long way to go with this growth comes maturity, and I feel like ive been growing apart from certain friends. This particular friend call him joe. Ive known since we were kids, but recently ive noticed every little thing he does is immature and all for attention, and I am over it. He does not understand social que and when it is appropriate to do certain things and when its not, he yells over everyone when he talks, if I am in a public place and talking to a stranger, he thinks its funny to push you in the back so you bump into them. He recently did this to me at a bar, which is just one example, but also the reason I am making this post, I was chatting with a nice girl for about minutes and out of no, where joe walks up and starts asking her questions about religion and her family and super personal crap that we werent even talking about. He was cockblocking me really bad, and I was getting frustersted because I really did like this girl and wanted to hangout later, and then he turns around to buy a drink. And all of a sudden I get shoved into this girl I was talking to and she ended up spilling her drink all over herself and me and I apologized and she drops theDrink on the ground and storms out of the bar with her friend. Its these type of things that are making, just want to stay away from joe forever. Now, he does not understand common sense. He is not pleasant to be around, and whenever I call him out and tell him he is being annoying, he makes claims that his friends are shady to him, and he doesnt do anything wrong. He is like a narccisist without even knowing it. He has no idea that hes cockblocking or being annoying in general. So when he gets called out for it, he thinks its not him. Thats the problem.

No, not at all. People change and evolve as they grow up or don as it appearsconfusion and develop at different speeds. There is nothing wrong from moving on and changing friendship circles to ones that suit your outlook on life and ambitions much better. Try not to be too bitter about it or dwell on it too much. It is part of life. I had a similar style friend who always liked the put downs and barging in on conversations, cockblocking, it is just bantaa confusion. It took me too long to work out why I was single for a good few years. Every time I started getting close to someone he was right over treading on toes, be it on the night, or as the friendship developed with a potential partner, it was more than once I would let slip. I was interested in a girl, only to find out within the week, he would made a move, or, at least made plenty of paedo gay, other jokes, confusion finally cut him off after a really sweet girl broke up with me. I was nice and all that, but she did not want the drama gossip that was going on behind my back. I kick myself for taking so long to figure it out, even after hearing him make snide comments behind other backs. I have met him a few times since, and he is still a very arrogant self centered twat. Was I a dick about it? No, I just moved on theFriendship was already in the gutter as I would ceased to be the ego boost he was always looking for. We just stopped hanging out simple as and I started doing other sports activities that I enjoyed from there I have ended up knowing some awesome friends who genuinely care.

Title: Slap that space bar.
Thread
Hi, everyone. Like most people occupying this space, I have some mental health complaints and I am pretty sure I am not under warranty anymore. I like a lot of people, have had a rough mental health journey over the pandemic and really before it as wellconfusion. Over the past year or so, I wake up in the morning feeling angry and resentful, and I have to dig myself out of it. I also have a massively bad couple days each month I am beginning to think I have an insane form of pre period hormone imbalance or something. And now this I feel hyper sensitive to sounds. I can count three times in the last week where these students I go to school with just fucking pound the keys on their laptop or desktop. I wanted to throw their computers out the window like there was one kid at the library with one crinkled piece of note paper, and he was slapping these gigantic keys on the keyboard like he was late, turning in a revised bible to god like, bro, your manifesto is not that cool! Shut the fuck up with your fingers. We had a test the day after, and we were allowed to take it on zoom computer or written form. About half of us chose to write it. Half were on zoom. And three people brought computers to take the test. There were keyboards next to me that because it was timed. Were getting the fuck slapped out of them. IFelt extremely physically triggered, like I wanted to slap the fucking table and yell what the fuck is wrong with you two same class dude is taking notes yesterday and turns out he is an extreme space bar slapper. Why the fuck do you have to hit the space bar like you re packing tobacco I literally stared at him twice like a psychopath because I wanted his space bar to shut the fuck up so bad all these people be fucking making sure we know they are around. And very important by typing as loudly as possible. Now what the hell is wrong with me why is it a bigger deal than it was like not even two weeks ago why am I experiencing this hairline trigger temper? I just want to, like, release some anger in a healthy way. I do not know how to vent it

Falling hard in love is not a bad thing. Give your everything for that relationship, not personconfusion, because it really matters how you value what you have, but not at the cost of losing yourself to nothingness. It the most heartbreaking feeling when you know you are falling hard deep. Amp deep into a void where there is noone at the other end to get a hold of you.

I have spent so much money on things like supplies, websites, domains, ingredients, dropshipping items, marketing materials, and then I lose interest for a few weeks. I spend time on nothing but these ideas and then I lose interest and the idea dies.

This could just be some combination of restlessness, boredom and need for stimulation and nothing clinical pathological with depression possibly contributing to disengaging. After some initial interest, bipolar individuals during manic states often start lots of news things only to quickly stop or never finish. But these tend to happen in shorter, more frantic bursts, as opposed to sustained interest that lasts weeks or longerconfusion adhd often results in stimulus seeking. But individuals with this disorder will often struggle in many other life domains disorganized, forgetful, unfocused, etcconfusion.

Title: Depression and anxiety.
Thread
For months, I have been feeling consistently sad and extremely overwhelmed with negative thoughts and feelings. I cry multiple times a day, stressed about work, school, home life. I am consumed by the feeling that I am a failure and not capable. I have no desire to engage in things that once brought me joy. I was not this way before. I used smile consistently and was typically happy. Now, I am scared of the world, and that constant smile became a facade. Its easier to smile and tell people everything is great than to be honest. Who wants to hear that you are tired of living? Most people dont. I have gotten to such a low point that I need help, and I cannot keep it in anymore. I want to get better for my loved ones, because while I suffer, I see them suffer as well. And that hurts more than anything else. My energy levels are so low. Getting out of bed is a task. Basic hygiene practices like showering and brushing my teeth take a toll. I do not eat much anymore. I need to figure out how to take control of my mind and my body again.

I have been so depressed recently, I even went into a partial program for suicide watchconfusion. And to be honest, it didnt change much of my life. I am still struggling. I have skipped my therapy appointments, but if I being honest today, I am feeling a little bit stronger. Here is my advice. Make sure that you are doing the bare minimum drinking water, getting at least hours of sleep, bathing at least every days, eat, breakfast and dinner. Keep reading, even if its just googling random articles or even watch. Ted talks. Also, keep telling people how you feel, even if its online to people you do not know. You cannot keep this feeling to yourself, because it will slowly devour your life. Keep crying. Your brain releases a chemical after you cry. That literally makes you happier. Also, if the people in your life did not get effected by you telling them how you feel, then I would be worried. They love you for a reason. Yes, you do not want anyone to feel sad, but you cannot continue holding all of this in and only dealing with it by yourself. It wont get better until you let it out.

Hello. I know exactly how you are feeling because I am going through the same thing I just turned, and since christmas, my mental health has been up and down. I have started seeing a therapist back in october and have been seeing one since then. I feel like it has sort of helped. But then there are times where I revert back to my deep sadness. I have also hit a low point where I am not even sure I want to even be here anymore, but would not want to do that to my family. Just recently, I have decided to deactivate all social media because I think social media is the major reason why I keep feeling so low. A lot of people my age are engaged, having kids or getting a house to add even more salt to the wound. They announce it during holidays. So I become even more bitter about it. Maybe it is my own personal issue, but I feel the constant need to compare, even though I do not have to. Everyone has their own path, but I cannot help but feel like there is a fucking clock ticking. Also, my younger sister got engaged during christmas and got a house with her. Now fianc, I could not even bring myself to be happy for them when they told the family I was even more hurt because I felt as though my own family kept comparing me and my younger sister since we are close in age andI felt like I should have done those things first I know exactly how you feel because my own family can feel my energy and they admit that it is hard to be around me I try to do stuff to distract myself but sometimes I think about it again I even started drinking to help me fall asleep crying myself to sleep has been up there too loudly crying face

I do not think anyone here is more enthusiastic about the benefits of self help than I am. But the way you describe your situation, I can only say that you should get help. Treatment usually begins by seeing the go, who can give you a referral? I mention referral, because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day. Any symptoms you might have, such as change in appetite or sleep, and things in your life affecting how you feel. I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this one practical advice for motivation. Very important,

Title: It just life right

Honestly, I hear this statement. Its just life so much when I try and explain how I feel to my parents or others. I am a year old australian confusion, who has very little to look forward to in life, even though I have a job and going to uniconfusion while I think about how shit life is and how I want to be dead, I am too scared to do anything. I want to stay for my partner. I get it if I want shit, I have to work. I need money to be able to live right now. Im in university. That also isnt great, but I rather study than work as I grow older. I realise how little there is to life. Wake up, go to work, come home, eat, when needed sleep. Yes, each day can be different and things can happen, but like, is there a point? I seriously cannot comprehend it. I have a good job with employers who annoy me so much and have treated me badly. I legit will cry and am exhausted all the time. But thats life, right? How? Why is it so shit? I fucking hate it. Why do I have to deal with this shit? But its just life, right? Its always that fucking statement. I hate it with a passion. Maybe I should just die, cause I cant deal with shit. I put my family and friends through enough. I can never explain without impacting them too much? Im too much I justHave an issue and cant fix it currently on a help line for an hour and no one has picked up. Why is it like this?

It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a sick society. Jiddu krishnamurti these are natural intelligent, much needed questions to the problems that are destroying the entire planet. All the precious lifeforms that live on it wink or smirk. And the only reason you feel frustrated, tormented, even raising them is due to a closed minded generation who, as you quite rightly point out, have become merely wage slaves as a result of a process you may have heard called indoctrination. Wink or smirk. Don forget you are dealing with aberrated people. They re not responsible for their answers. They re victims of culture. That means they have been influenced by their culture. Jacque fresco their answers frustrate me also their sententious ambiguous platitudes, misplaced, arrogance, mentally, docile responses, based upon an economic model that outlived its usefulness. Years ago, I must say now that I am not surprised. The younger generation are disconnected from society. I would bury my head in drugs, porn, escapism, when the only alternative is to prostrate contribute towards a self destructive regime of partisan separation. Dumb founded political opposition, obtuse racism, glutinous destruction of our own bio sphere, laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses. The true purpose of education is to make minds, not careers. Chris hedges the rewards your parents generation were promised do not interest you by the sound of things because you have discovered the joy of loving living, learning, happy face smiley you are not just an ass following the goldenCarrot. And what is more is that the solutions required for our future do not lie in repeating a few basic mundane patterns everyday, but in learning to work together in solving problems by putting education before all else, making that a life long journey. How you have come to these same conclusions on your own, quite frankly, staggers me skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitantconfusion. You are very impressive. I must say, I admire you, have people that get their kicks out of helping people instead of getting their kicks out of beating people. Roxanne meadows there is only one global project that aims to utterly change the way we live, to the extent you seem to be well adjusted for. I doubt many have heard of. It is called the venus project. It based upon science, the betterment of all the world. People post capitalist it sounds radical to the palsied mind laughing out loud. But it makes a lot of rational sense. The more I learn about it, the more it begins to make sense, which is both frightening, exciting. You will need a large coffee for this share, ha, laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses. But give it a click. Have a go! It is the most incredible proposal I have ever come across and explains that what you feel is shared by millions happy face smiley, including myself laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses.

Title: I feel completely shattered and I have no self esteem to begin with and I am going through a break up.
Thread
I have been taking care of my aunt and grandmother since I was. They both receive government benefits. Both have a deteriorating mental state. We have moved times thier paranoia has isolated me even from other family members. We have moved times because my grandmother believes an invisible substance the neighbors pump through our walls will kill us. She didnt allow me to do anything with friends or even next door. I sat in my room, so I turned to video games and heavily studied psychology, even though I dropped out of school due to my self esteem, bonded with people online, entered my first relationship. It lasted years and ended recently last week. She crushed on me and we even discussed kids together. I smothered my emotions and passion alot, I was willing to be intimate the first time we met up, but she told me no, I respected her wishes, but that killed me inside and time I caught her trying to fake. I tried to comfort her, but it brought up so many insecurities. My grandmother then suspected fraud and closed her bank account, putting us behind on bill. A few thousand dollars. I had to get a second job, worked it for about months. New year hits. Internet gets turned off my only life line. I am panicking, doing everything I can to fix this. I am working, taking care of my grandmother, even though she berates me and becomes difficult, trying to sort out social security stuff. Even though I haveNo knowledge of what I am doing. I get back and my girlfriend breaks up with me. I always told myself I would play it cool if she did, but I broke down and begged. I even comforted her and calmed her down from a panic attack.

Because ones mind thoughtconfusion is not ones life, if thought would be ones life, one could imagine it anyway one wants. And that is clearly not factual. When one sits in a chair with happy thoughts or sad thoughts, the facts is, one is still sitting in a chair, life is the same.

I honestly hare that is usually just something that people say when they are done dealing with you and your issues, even when you never asked for their help or advice for me, it just tells me that they do not actually understand at all. They do not understand that your illness is a part of you. It has made you who your are. It is somthing that you will continue to be for your entire life.

I do not remember a whole lot about the hospital admission, but I had told a few friends I was not very well, including my friend sarah and I speak most days and I would not say we were super close but she knew I was struggling. A couple of days after admission, I text her something light and she replied, have you any idea what your behaviour has done to people? I apologised profusely and she did not reply. I got home a few days later and text to let her know no answer. After a couple of weeks, I messaged to say I was sorry if she had been hurt, upset, worried, no response. I then went light and sent her a funny me that was related to an invoke. Nothing. I behaved as normal with her on social media, liked and commented on things and tagged her. But she would not interact with me. A week ago, I sent her a message is everything ok as its now been around, weeks since she is said anything to me? No reply. She has not blocked or muted me on anything. And I can see she views my instagram stories. The second I post while I would be happy to wait around. We are going on vacation next month, everything is booked inMy name although she has paid her half it for her birthday and I do not know what her plans are now she not responding to me and we do not have any close mutual I can ask to dig for info. I am feeling an extreme amount of anxiety around the trip. Now it too expensive for me to buy her out, plus, I would feel like an asshole kicking her off her own birthday vacation. I can feel myself starting to slip again because of the anxiety caused by her lack of response. I did really want to go, but I feel now that I do not want to go with her because of the silent treatment. If she gets in touch the week before it will be a really awkward trip. Any insight advice appreciated

No idea what she means by your behavior if she means your mental health crisis that is just mean girl stuff she owes you an apology I would find someone to go with have them pay you and send the money to her let her ghost off do not have to feel like an asshole when her behavior is obviously her attempt to punish you for something she did not even bother to tell you specifically bothered her if she does get in touch tell her you are not comfortable because she is being cold and you do not even understand why and you do not want her on the trip she does not deserve it

Do you have any mutual friends? You can ask about what she is referring to? It sounds like she is not going to want to go on the trip with you. Unfortunately.

I have recently been feeling a horrendous weight in my chest and stomach whenever I eat I do not suffer from any feeding disorders nor has my regular diet changed recently it just started happening for days now whenever I eat breakfast, my stomach feels like its signaling imminent vomiting but it never happens I would not call myself a glutton I do eat everything that is served in my plate and remain with a small bit of hunger but now I feel nauseated and sick I do not take any medication and I really do not feel any other symptom of sickness no high fevers not nausea, not dizziness. My sleep schedule is bad, but it is still the best it has been in years. I feel that I should speak to a professional of this, but I just wanted to know if anyone here has suffered from something similar due to a mental issue. As I have not been able to pinpoint what the cause is physical or mental

Schools deprive you of discovery. Schools are hostile environments, where competition, fear of being made to look, insufficientconfusion, is pumped into your head. Non stop, which is socially offensive, mentally dangerous, counter productive. All kids, including myself, feel insecure because we are not born with knowledge that has to be learned over many years without end and to learn. One must admit to oneself, I do not know it the hardest thing to admit. Yet at school, everyone goes around trying to convince themselves others that they are popular or perfect already see how confusing it is. Every time we make a mistake, we gather more information on how to make better decisions in the future. Happy face smiley logical. I must say now, though that you are very self aware which will work to your advantage. Happy face smiley you just need to understand that mistakes are lessons to be taken as a golden opportunity to learn. But as I said, schools never welcome mistakes. What is worse is that they treat them as failures as weakness, incompetence, or an opportunity for other kids to shame you. It is little wonder we cannot relate to one another when there is a front, a shield, a fear, a veil up at all times. And adults do not understand this at all because their education was even worse so far ago, like years laughing out loud. The truth. Behavioral science critical thinking is kept out of schools. Colleges, uni, because it would teach humans to learn toThink to collaborate, question everything rather than obey, blindly, to get used to corporate competition, as you have impressively pointed out, it separates us wink or smirk. World rulers do not want their advantage to change, thus fear us working together. So schools breed methods of segregation. A scientists role in life is to question everything laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses. Questioning is seen as offensive. Why are our children self harming? Why are kids so desperate to prove themselves on tiktok as a result of insecurities? Why are we forcing pal to stop life long education in favour of working everyday? Instead, why are we killing our planet? Why are not changing the way we live? Learn and love? You have asked a question today laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses. That is the most important lesson of all to ask questions. And if someone does not know, they usually react aggressively if they too, do not know how to simply admit, I do not know. Wink or smirk. Just be ordinary and nothing special. Eat your food, move your bowels pass water, and when you are tired, go and lie down, the ignorant will laugh at me, but the wise will understand. Bruce lee

Outside of an explanation and attempts to better yourself. There is nothing you can do if you are trying to better yourself. Everything will be okay. They are your friends and will understand. Don sweat it too much. Just focus on working on bettering yourself.

Title: Hello, lights. My grandma is. And for about years, she has suffered from a mental health issue. We have been told is depression. I feel there is more to it. I need advice.
Thread
So it all started with low mood in the mornings and struggling to get out of bed, even for her most cherished happenings, like church at first it was mild, but it has become so severe to the point, I hear her praying for death when she prays at night. Its so hard for her to articulate what she is going through. She tells me, this is not my head. My head is awful. Ive been here too long. It is just indescribable. What she says is happening to her. Shes had a lot trauma over her lifetime, tragic deaths that I think she grew stronger from. So I presume unrelated. She used to be very lively, interested and passionate about life since she turned. It is been a steady decline of the positive feelings like happiness. Shes currently under nos, public care, and they have tried various talking therapies medications, but it honestly feels like they have just kept her in this false hope. We go round and round medications, and she waits to see if they help, and when they dont believes she is passed any help. She has had mri scans, but nothing of concern showed up there apart from osteoarthritis in the knee, partial deafness. She is physically healthy for. She has been taking eyedrops for a decade as she is a candidate for glaucoma. It does say something about depression on the side effects list of these eyedrops. But this was not of concern. When we pointed it out to herDoctor, I witness a lot of negative self talk, and I think it has come as a bit of a shock for her that she needs assistance to do some simple tasks, like opening packets and tins. Every little mishap, like dropping a bit of food, becomes an issue of living too long. I have told her a few times about breathing exercises, as they have gradually helped me with my own struggles. But she is in a place where she is not receptive to it, basically just wondering if there is something else to do. Any feedback or suggestions are appreciated, even advice for my approach to the situation or useful herbs, etc. Many thanks.

I am sorry you are, family is experiencing this. I am sorry to say depression is quite common in the elderly more often than not they have had it their whole lives and simply just cannot cope like they used to. They do not have the same outlets to distract them. Loss of independence, the realization your family may be your carers soon. Physical pain, aging in general cam be very hard to accept, especially for those who have led troubled but resilient lives. Unfortunately, medication, lifestyle change and or therapy are the only solutions there could be more to it. But it is very possible that is all this is it does not sound out of the norm at all. For me, after having worked in care homes,

Im really scared. I always feel cold, I cant calm down. I dont even leave my house anymore, because everything doesnt feel safe anymore. I just want to rest. But I cant. This happened when the person whos special to me attempted de and it was traumatic for both of us. She still try to reach me out to apology. However, the idea of her coming back just scares me.

Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy. Cbtconfusion than with medicine, and some are successful with self help. Based on cut, I can show you some cut self help. But first I want to say that recently, there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing. When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently. Seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain and you feel better. Also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. Count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication don overlook stress management it can help even with very bad anxiety. Video a lot of helpful information, including the partProgram of brown and gerbarg.

Title: Taking time off work to focus on my mental health.
Thread
I am thinking of taking time off from work. My company has unlimited to my problem is that I know deep down, I want to leave this job, but I also do not want to lose income and health insurance. Theres stuff in my personal life which has impacted me more than I thought, stuff that I do not share with my colleagues at work, but nonetheless exists and influences my concentration and focus at work by taking time off to focus on my mental health. It bides me time. I know I am not going to fully heal from the personal stuff in a month, but having time off would allow me to figure out next steps without having to worry about being a professional hours a week. I am nervous about having this conversation with my manager. I do not want to leave the team hanging for an unknown amount of time, but I also recognize that I am not putting forth my best effort. My mental space is clogged up a week. Vacation is not going to be the cure all. But I also think that taking months off would be asking far too much it hard, because I know so many people are stressed and exhausted and suffering from burnout, so I cannot help but think, why do I deserve to ask for time off when everyone needs it? And then I have to rationalize it with. Everyone is entitled to take time off if they don that is on them. ItOk that you want to take it. And I do not have a therapist that could provide a doctors note for me to prove I need the time off. I am currently consulting with a few therapists to find the right fit, but I would not be able to say that any of them could vouch for me at this point. I am not a harm to myself or to others. Fyi confusion, deep breath.

A week vacation is not going to be the cure all but I also think that taking months off would be asking far too much having time off and the freed up head space can help you reflect on what you need in all life domains including potentially making some career changes and I do not have a therapist that could provide a doctors note for me to prove I need. The time off is that an he requirement for your job whats the company policy for people who just want a vacation?

Title: Just wants to stop being the way I am overall.
Thread
It so infuriating over time, I only grow to hate myself. I engage in activities and regrets them immediately, and then I would just hate myself. And then the cycle repeats. Why do not? I just stop and think before I act, I only end up hurting others and myself. I wish I just stop being the way I am it exhausting.

Title: I feel completely shattered and I have no self esteem to begin with and I am going through a break up.
Thread
I have been taking care of my aunt and grandmother since I was. They both receive government benefits. Both have a deteriorating mental state. We have moved times thier paranoia has isolated me even from other family members. We have moved times because my grandmother believes an invisible substance the neighbors pump through our walls will kill us. She didnt allow me to do anything with friends or even next door. I sat in my room, so I turned to video games and heavily studied psychology, even though I dropped out of school due to my self esteem, bonded with people online, entered my first relationship. It lasted years and ended recently last week. She crushed on me and we even discussed kids together. I smothered my emotions and passion alot, I was willing to be intimate the first time we met up, but she told me no, I respected her wishes, but that killed me inside and time I caught her trying to fake. I tried to comfort her, but it brought up so many insecurities. My grandmother then suspected fraud and closed her bank account, putting us behind on bill. A few thousand dollars. I had to get a second job, worked it for about months. New year hits. Internet gets turned off my only life line. I am panicking, doing everything I can to fix this. I am working, taking care of my grandmother, even though she berates me and becomes difficult, trying to sort out social security stuff. Even though I haveNo knowledge of what I am doing. I get back and my girlfriend breaks up with me. I always told myself I would play it cool if she did, but I broke down and begged. I even comforted her and calmed her down from a panic attack.

Title: Friend ship advice.
Thread
Hey guys, lately I have been feeling not like myself for like the past month or so. I have been having these feelings of wanting, be alone, remove my friends from my life ink. Why? To be honest, these feelings are projected towards to my friends group, specifically, even though they did not do me wrong or anything. Sure, they can be annoying sometimes, but I dont think that is enough to stop being friends with them. I am not depressed. But ink why I feel like that. Any advice on this topic

Maybe decrease how much you interact with them through text. Have some time for yourself theyll understand.

Title: Old friend is not well feedback on how I am trying to help.
Thread
To preface this by old friend. I mean, he is a friend, but we do not really talk anymore. We mostly converse through a mutual friend who we both hang out with. Still nothing bad happened between us. We just do not hang out together. So recently, it has come to my attention that he is having severe mental issues and by severe, I mean, he has some sort of psychosis or schizophrenia. He cannot hold a conversation and is barely listening when spoken to in this state, I can tell he has been hospitalized twice and was given medication. Obviously, he keeps not taking it and having to go back. I found out this has been going on for about months from that common friend and his now ex girlfriend. They re taking a break, she saysconfusion when he is on his meds. He still might act spacey or weird occasionally, but is mostly normal and put together, or at least seems to be. He can at least hold a conversation normally and is not doing weird things. His actual friends are fake, as in now that he needs help. They pretty much have ghosted him people I knew in high school, and it seems, par for the course. Its really just me and our common friend trying to help his ex girlfriend a little bit, though she is distancing herself from it. His mother has her own mental issues as well, and is pretty much useless. Currently, my approach to it helping him hasBeen this I tell him to take his medication and that we cannot really talk until he does. He not lucid and nothing we say matters if he does not take his meds, I cannot help him unless he helps himself. I do not think he will take them again until he is hospitalized again. Though hopefully nothing too bad happens. Is there anything more that I can really do when he does take them again and I can speak to him. I want to try and understand better, but I doubt it be that easy. So any tips on for when that happens as well. Thank you.

I totally agree it not just about being sad it can be our expectation failure but the great thing is we can recover from this by our own will such as thinking positively, sharing your thoughts counseling etc depression is just a state where we feel all alone walking on a street on a dark night suggest overcoming this as it can affect your overall health in the coming days

I got major depressive disorder myself at the end of the day, even though some do not understand it is with our own hands that forge the path to overcoming our inner demons. Never give up. Keep on fighting, even if it is hard, even if you are tired. One thought that helps me a lot when there is no chance in hell, no possibility of winning. That is when the real fight really begins. If you lose, a battle does not mean you lose the war, go down once, get back up twice.

This is by far the easiest definition of depression ive seen. I can relate to a lot of this, like, I have experienced a lot of symptoms like that, and I used to be a huge favorite of christmas, but this year, it felt like a regular day, and its hard for me to do things that I like. Its hard to see the good in life, and its always been hard for me to do that in general, but especially with depression.

Its always best to be honest with your therapist, depending on what else you discuss, they may recommend inpatient care. You may want to ask if there is an option to do an intensive outpatient program, iopconfusion, where you would go for group and individual therapy during the weekdays, so you can work with a treatment team to better manage your symptoms. Its about hours each day, and you get to go back home. After that was the option I was given when I disclosed that I had suicidal thoughts and plans and it saved my life. The group therapy helps a lot when you see that others are going through similar issues and knowing that you are not alone makes a huge difference. Best wishes, and I hope you get the support that you need

Feeling scared, feeling afraid, feeling overwhelmed, feeling your chest crushing, feeling out of breath. No inspiration to do anything you once enjoyed wanting to be creative. Yet it is too much effort and your too disappointed to pick up any medium for art, racing thoughts, weakness in the body hiding behind the mask, everything making you nauseous.

Depression is different from being depressed. Anxiety is different from feeling anxious. I tell people that all the time from there, it depends on the person lol, but it is so important for people to understand, like a friend once lost his job and was all I suffering from depression? Now, like you, and I am like, no, your depressed cause you lost your job. Once your working again, you will be fine, which is what happen. Bow, my brain no longer has the ability to be happy about anything, probably for the rest of my life. But I have recently decided that I do not really want my loved ones to understand that much. They cannot help, and it will just make them sad if they really knew what it was like in my head. I do not want to do that to them.

For me, depression feels like an iron blanket all over me. It heavy, it blocks most everything else. I lose sight of reasons to live and life meaning. Even though I am a parent with little children, the only thing I tend to do is watch to and eat junk. However, if given opportunity, I can still enjoy myself and my hobbies, I get depressed because I cannot control most things in my life and have no space for myself. My therapist tried to frame depression for me as a sort of self defense mechanism that I developed to protect myself. And I guess that interpretation makes sense to me and helped me understand its meaning and to accept it. Maybe my depression, though, is not as severe as others describe here,

I agree with you. Depression is hell mixed with anxiety. It is such an unlikeable situation. I lay in bed and my heart races so much I can see it. Life is sad. People come and go out of your life, and you never see them again. Death of loved ones is around the corner. We can hardly cope with daily life, let alone losing someone we deeply love. There is so much sadness in this world it like a big black hole with no light. And even if there is light, we are too tired to care with. We could all be together to laugh and cry and forget about the darkness, even if for a short time

When you feel there are no reasons left to live that is depression. Every single thing in the world you ever enjoyed becomes completely tasteless. People who go through this and still find a reason to stick around are courageous.

It feels like opening a present everyday, but seeing an abyss inside it feels like all the color of the world has been washed away when you so desperately want to paint it again. I hope one day, depression can be taken more seriously than how it is stigma around. Mental health really sucks.

When it comes to suicide, there is ideation, just thoughtsconfusion planning and intent to act on thoughts and plans. The typical admission criteria is intent where the therapist believes somebody may reasonably harm themselves in the immediate future. Ideation with a specific plan, but no current intent technically does not qualify, but it is ultimately the call of each individual provider, and some may be very conservative in initiating hospitalization, while others may be really happy to help you cope with ideation with a plan, but no intentconfusion on an outpatient basis. Good luck, and hang in there.

Title: Ink if I can even be here really.
Thread
This is going to be long, but I hope you take the time to read it. I would be really happy if you did well. First of all, I do not have it bad. It would be a disservice to all the stories I have read here and to many of the people I have met to say that I am in a state of absolute need for help. I just want to share what I have been feeling like for awhile to know what people think I am next month I be. For a variety of reasons. I have not really been doing anything to further my life in any direction. For a long time I have been stuck in a constant loop of self imposed escapism and stagnation. I do not think I am depressed, although I might have felt depressed at some point along the way. I do not have a driver license. I have not had a single hint of a romantic relationship in more than three years. I have friends, but I really do not enjoy hanging out with them most of the time. I have dreams, but I have not set a clear goal for myself. In a decade, I thinkconfusion I tend to suppress my emotions in fear that I might embarrass my self, and I really do not speak out when I have an opinion. All these things are some of the ways I deal with the prospect of having to move forward with my life. You canReally take any example of any situation you can think of, and apart from extreme cases, I get out of it by manipulating or by being your friendly, neutral neighbor. The result is that I live in my own world that is mainly made of anime and videogames. I go along with each day feeling the same gray and uneventful. Sometimes I think about something new to do, but I scare myself in the process, or I just end up thinking, it is not worth the effort.

Title: Ink if I can even be here really.
Thread
This is going to be long, but I hope you take the time to read it. I would be really happy if you did well. First of all, I do not have it bad. It would be a disservice to all the stories I have read here and to many of the people I have met to say that I am in a state of absolute need for help. I just want to share what I have been feeling like for awhile to know what people think I am next month I be. For a variety of reasons. I have not really been doing anything to further my life in any direction. For a long time I have been stuck in a constant loop of self imposed escapism and stagnation. I do not think I am depressed, although I might have felt depressed at some point along the way. I do not have a driver license. I have not had a single hint of a romantic relationship in more than three years. I have friends, but I really do not enjoy hanging out with them most of the time. I have dreams, but I have not set a clear goal for myself. In a decade, I thinkconfusion I tend to suppress my emotions in fear that I might embarrass my self, and I really do not speak out when I have an opinion. All these things are some of the ways I deal with the prospect of having to move forward with my life. You canReally take any example of any situation you can think of, and apart from extreme cases, I get out of it by manipulating or by being your friendly, neutral neighbor. The result is that I live in my own world that is mainly made of anime and videogames. I go along with each day feeling the same gray and uneventful. Sometimes I think about something new to do, but I scare myself in the process, or I just end up thinking, it is not worth the effort. Although I have a part time job, I leach heavily off of my parents. I am really tired of being stuck. I have it good when compared to most people, and because of that, I also know that I am just acting spoiled.

I had kind of the same problem as you just make a plan with smart objectives and it became like a videogame with missions that you have to do for example I want to move to canada in years so one of the thing that I need to do is improve my english so I just unsubscribed for almost all the spanish channels in youtube that I was following and replaced them for their equal in english here is an advice enjoy the process if you enjoy what you do you are going to make it easy is kind of boring just doing nothing following your dreams is more exciting and makes your life more funny life is short to wasting your time in a situation that you do not like. By the way, enjoying videogames and anime is not a bad thing. Just do something productive and follow your plan

Title: An embarrassing problem I am having.
Thread
I care. Waay too much about what other people think of me online. I know I should not, and I try not to, but it affects me to the point where I feel crippled with negative emotion and cannot function properly. I over analyze everything I post or say, worrying that people will judge me and anything I have to share is stupid and or uninteresting. These are mostly strangers who I will probably never meet yet. I am letting this bother me so badly.

Title: What do I do in between therapy sessions?
Thread
Hello, sorry. If I am posting something incorrectly, I just joined this subreddit to post this. I very recently just started seeing a therapist at my school to help me deal with anxieties and everything else going on in my head. I had a get to know you session two weeks ago and just had my first real session today. The session was good. But the way it works at my school is that typically, counseling is every other week, unless specifically requested. I have been having a rough week and asked if I could come again next week, since the person I am seeing said, if I needed it, they could get me in. Unfortunately, I am pretty busy with classes and could not find a time that would work for me. So my next session is in two weeks. Obviously it is what it is. And they said, if any spots opened up, they would let me know. But two weeks right now just feels like such a long time with how I have been feeling. I get that these things take time, and I am fine with that. But currently, I feel a bit shaken on what to do now, especially since I am in such an incredibly early stage of therapy. What am I supposed to do to help me manage everything going on while I wait for the next session? I do not want to overly burden my friends with my worries and all or just continue having my mind race.For weeks is there any strategies or anything I can do to help get to the next session easier? Any advice is appreciated.

Consider asking for a home practice goal based on what you talk about in session so that you can work tangibly toward a desired goal and report back on successes and challenges. Having goals like this can hopefully translate to long term beneficial change. Good luck.

Therapists often recommend self help for between sessions. When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently. Seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem. Instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better. Also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts, count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication don overlook stress management. It can help, even with very bad anxiety. Video a lot of helpful information, including the part program of brown and gerbarg

I am a sociopath psychopath. According to my psychiatrist and I committed some crimes without remorse, and I was not in prison, so I cannot talk hereabouts it, but I am loyal to my country, usaconfusion, and I love it.

Title: How does therapy help if you cannot communicate?
Thread
Amongst my many issues. One of them is such extreme anxiety, where there are moments that even when I am trying to speak, I am so paralysed that I cannot say anything. It can range from what I cannot say between something as mundane as my dad asking me what I would like to drink to my therapist, asking why I am suicidal. But the really annoying thing is that therapy at it is core, works based on communicating. So how is it meant to help someone who cannot communicate properly? I have a bunch of mental health issues that really need help urgently before I off myself, but I cannot get any help with them, because I cannot properly speak to my therapists. It is extremely frustrating. I have been in therapy for almost years and been on sertraline for a little under years. Nothing has helped at all, in fact, because it is taken so long everything else in my life has become a whole lot worse. The last years, each day, it gets worse, and there is only so long I can hold on when there is no hope of getting better. Anyone got a clue how to help me

Therapy can be done with individuals with disorders like aphasia, loss of language, abilitiesconfusion, following stroke, which requires both therapist and patient to make accomodations and identify reasonable goals, which is to say that anything that is a barrier can potentially be solved through troubleshooting. If one or both parties are willing, perhaps discuss your barriers explicitly, maybe through email or letter confusion with your therapist and see what they recommend.

Please try to think positive thoughts. I struggle with a lot of the same feelings and inability to communicate with others. I found it helpful to remember a time where I felt extreme confidence and think about that moment for a few minutes. Whenever I am feeling down or feel like my anxiety is eating away at my brain. I have been struggling for the past years, and this was the first thing I have done that has helped me feel better for extended periods. I am starting to become a strong believer in the power of attitude and positivity. If you think negatively, then negative things will happen. If you think positively, very hard, but try your best to be consistentconfusion, then positive things will happen think positively. I hope this helps you in some way. Its incredibly hard to feel this way. Also, maybe try writing a few thoughts or ideas down every day. It helps to stimulate creativity and alleviate intrusive thoughtsconfusion. Good luck.

It sounds like you need to push harder for better quality of care. There are plenty of therapy modalities that do not involve a lot of you talking? Have you tried anything like ect, emir ketamine art therapy, etc.

Title: High functioning.
Thread
Hi, there I have a chronic mental health problem, of which I am in recovery. I am high functioning, as it is called. However, chronic disorder is still part of my life in terms of muddled thinking and executive behaviour, which mostly fails to gain desired effects. Very often, it is the case that I can be successful in one area, say my studies, but abysmally poor in another area. For example, in keeping my house clean, I belief that this is a problem of personal productivity. However, I also understand that the mental health problems are determining the disorder. My question, then, is what systematic and individual solutions can be presented to deal with such behaviours? I am looking for experience based solutions, either of a personal or academic style. I am currently on meds and use mindfulness and cut

Why is it so easy for me to let situations go once someone makes me upset or wrongs me? If they apologize and explain themselves while giving me time to cool off, I will always forgive them. This has upset my friends and family, because sometimes people do not deserve to be forgiven. But I feel no emotion during situations like these, I forgive people extremely easily. I struggle with thinking about cutting them off after, since I do not feel any particular way about the situation I was mad about in the first place anymore. How can I fix this?

Title: I am occasionally so overwhelmed by small decisions that I become paralyzed is this normal?
Thread
This has been happening to me since college, but my most recent episode happened yesterday, and I am wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or knows what is happening to me. Specifically, often after a long day at work school, I head to the grocery store to grab something for dinner. When I walk inside, I feel kind of in a dream like state, like things are not real. When I try to decide on a meal, I cannot make a decision. It not like I won. I physically cannot. I will pick up things and put them back and just pace and wander the aisles for a very long time. I usually eventually choose something familiar that I have eaten before, but I always feel like I have made a mistake choosing the food I did. This is usually after an hour or so at the store. When I go to checkout, I feel on the brink of tears, and if anything strange happens at checkout, my card gets declined, etc. Confusion. I just leave the store without my food and have what feels like a panic attack in my car, hyperventilating, crying, feeling terrifiedconfusion. When I get home, I am utterly exhausted and just go to bed. Does this happen to anyone else? And if so, do you know what it is? It happens to me? Every week, two weeks, I told my therapist a watered down version of this, and she basically told me it is nothing to worry about and probablyJust some anxiety, but it has ruined grocery stores, restaurants with large menus and many other scenarios that involve decisions for me so much so that even on my birthday this year, I could not choose a place to eat because I had an attack. This is my first ever post. So please be kind. I would just like some advice.

I only read the title. I do not have enough energy to read anything getting overwhelmed and paralyzed is not that uncommon and happens to me all the time. There is actually a term for it called paralysis by analysis.

Title: I am occasionally so overwhelmed by small decisions that I become paralyzed is this normal?
Thread
This has been happening to me since college, but my most recent episode happened yesterday, and I am wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or knows what is happening to me. Specifically, often after a long day at work school, I head to the grocery store to grab something for dinner. When I walk inside, I feel kind of in a dream like state, like things are not real. When I try to decide on a meal, I cannot make a decision. It not like I won. I physically cannot. I will pick up things and put them back and just pace and wander the aisles for a very long time. I usually eventually choose something familiar that I have eaten before, but I always feel like I have made a mistake choosing the food I did. This is usually after an hour or so at the store. When I go to checkout, I feel on the brink of tears, and if anything strange happens at checkout, my card gets declined, etc. Confusion.

Maybe borderline always putting off decisions till you have no choice then blaming the situation for that result I blame my parents who constantly flip flopped and were unstable as fuck so I never knew how to make a decision I never did find a good way to deal with this other than complete avoidance and alcoholism lost a good chunk of my going nowhere also sounds like anxiety as well doctors hate to deal with borderline most have no idea how I would suggest reading a debt workbook easy to find on amazon

That happens to me all the time, not usually to quite that extent, but my ability to make decisions about anything no matter how trivial is embarrassingly bad and worsens, the more anxious I am. I wish I could offer some advice, but I have been dealing with this for most of my life, and I have got nothing. Trying to put things in perspective, weighing the pros and cons of each option, thinking about how I decided about similar things in the past, nothing works. So often my choice in any situation is, whatever the default is due to not making a decision, it really sucks.

I struggle with something similar, but not as intense whenever I have to make a decision and did end up picking something I always feel like it is a mistake that is going to come and bite me in the future or that my life is doom just because I made the wrong purchase or decisions in general and ends up having an attack. And most times, when I regret something, I will not be able to stop thinking about it for days or even weeks and will have repeated attacks from the same thought about one decision. I honestly do not really know what it is either, and have also spoken to my therapist about it, but they did not say much about it. Theyare just helping me work through my struggles, rather than labelling it, which is pretty nice, I guess. But I would like to think it is a form of anxiety that results in an attack. Because when I try to make a decision, it leads me to overthink and feel super uneasy and panics about it. So I suppose your therapist might be right, that it is a form of anxiety, but I do not think it is nothing to worry about. I think it is something that you can work through slowly and personally, I am trying my best to work through it, because I really hate making decisions because of the way it makes me feel. But life is all about choices. So in order for me to beAble to enjoy life. I am working through this struggle. I think you can try training yourself to make small decisions when you are at the comfort of your own home, where it might feel safer for you to make those decisions, maybe try writing out your thought process. When you are making a decision start small. And when you notice your thoughts are irrational when making those decisions point it out to yourself as a reminder. Hope this helps feel free to chat with me if you just want someone to talk about this to, I do not know anyone else who struggles about making decisions in this way, so it would nice to relate to

Title: Depression is not just sadness
Thread
A lot of people seem to think that depression is like how they feel when their favorite show ends or they get dumped or, etc. Its not depression is losing the ability to enjoy nice weather. Its spending your most important moments your graduation, your wedding, your childs birth, holding back tears of sorrow rather than joy. Its finding the to shows, books, hobbies, foods and activities you used to enjoy as boring as watching paint dry. Its feeling so exhausted. You cant get out of bed for days, its spending every waking hour just waiting for the day to be over. Its destroying yourself. Just trying to feel something. Depression is hell

I agree, and depression lasts a long time, not hours. I mean, many days or even months to years. Being depressed is the worst thing that happened to me and I have had a lot of bad things happen to me.

Sadness is like a rain shower or even a torrent coming down in your mind, drowning out your thoughts and feelings in sorrow. Depression is like an all consuming black hole at the center of your mind, immediately sucking up any other emotions on the edge. As soon as they begin to form a gaping, weighted chasm of despair and emptiness.

I agree. Depression, for me, is simply not enjoying life. Simple pleasures seem mundane.

No, it is not, but I can tell you that most people would not be able to appreciate the difference. Hell, when I was depressed, I forgot what regular sadness felt like and assumed it was normal now that I have somehow managed to overcome it whenever I am down, I can easily tell the difference.

Title: A bond between a parent and a child being torn is a sin, but is it bad if they cause each other a headache?
Thread
Taking the right from mom to choose her well, being or consoling her daughter despite her mental health would be bad. But if she chooses to stress and I do not intervene, is that worse? Like my sister needs an outlet and moms the best, but she non stop, just stresses her out and makes her feel like the worlds going to end. Shes like and not healthy. And I just want her to relax and enjoy life.
Comments
Don be to forceful about it but suggesting and making the decision easy for mum may be the best option. Make the decision for her can make her feeling of control over her own life diminished. And that not always the best way of doing things suggest the idea, make a plan, and most of all have everything set up for it to be very easy decision show her that everything is set up but do not force it hope this helped you are doing what is right and its good you asked for help.

Title: Anxiety and anhedonia. How to get my life moving in the right direction.
Thread
I confusion, am currently unemployed. My friendships have withered away. I am not close with my family or anyone else. I have done every kind of therapy, medication, mental health treatment out there, with no success. I have hobbies, although I cannot enjoy them. I exercise very regularly, although this is also miserable due to the anhedonia. Basically, any time I leave my house, I get mild anxiety, and social settings make it worse. I did not used to have these issues at all. It just all started a couple years ago, when my nervous system just started going haywire. I have tried to find at least a temp job that is low stress and will not have me being berated by angry customers. But so far, I have had no luck. It difficult for me to develop social connections because I am literally unable to enjoy anything ever. I basically just do whatever I can to pass the time. My parents currently pay my bills, which strains our already less than optimal relationship. Additionally, people are very judgmental of me because they assume I am lazy and incompetent and thus often are not kind of helpful towards me. Is there anything I can do for myself? Please do not recommend meditation or yoga, because while I am sure those things work for some, they definitely do not work for everyone. Thanks.

Title: Fear of abandonment and relationship anxiety.
Thread
I feel like a very weak person. Mentally and emotionally. I am so scared to continue being like this. I am now, yet I still have these stupid feelings. I sometimes pretend to be okay, fake it til you make it, they say. But deep inside, I am still scared to be left alone, like I have always been, and this fear is affecting my relationship. I remember thinking like this since I was young, I grew up being so attached to my mom, she would take me to work to the grocery, etc. Even though I had other siblings who wanted to come with her too. I was with her all the time, so it really affected me when she and my dad decided to let us stay at my grandmas house when we were in kindergarten. I would feel homesick. Everyday. Being at school was no fun, because it only made me miss my mom. I was so attached to her that I could not concentrate, my sister would watch to, and I would sit by the window missing my mom. We would go home only every weekend. This went on until I was in primary school. When I was in primary school, my mom would not pick us up until am I would watch other kids get picked up by their parents. I would just cry and feel like she would forgotten us. My sister would play alone and was unbothered. My mom would say, whenever she arrived, why did you think iWould forget you I am just late. It does not mean I will not arrive. And she was right. Why the fuck did I always assume she would not pick us up? I think that was one of the first symptoms of my fear of abandonment. I am the eldest, and my siblings seemed to have turned out fine and become emotionally independent and stable. Why was my first assumption always that my mom forgot about me? Its not a normal response, and I feel so dumb yet I could not stop thinking that way. I just got older. But those thought patterns have never completely left me. Maybe I lack something in my brain. So many people have been through worse, but they turned out fine. I hate to say this, but I feel like an amnesia is the only thing that can heal me at this point. Fast forward to when I was in high school, I had my first of. I never thought he would leave me at all because I was confident that he loved me, no matter what, but my mom would not let me have a boyfriend. So he broke up with me when I was in college, after not having seen each other for a year. It was impossible to meet. Since my mom would drop me off and pick me up from school everyday. We were together for years. It took me months to get over that relationship. When he returned. I did not want him anymore. ButIt had changed the way I thought about relationships. I was always depressed even after I got over him. I thought I would not find love again. I would see other couples and even married relatives and think could I ever find something like that at this stage of my life, my parents separated due to my dads affairs and multiple baby mas over the years it made me feel so hopeless about love. A few years later, I had another of I was with him for years, but he cheated on me. The worst part was not the cheating, though the entire relationship he kept dropping hints that he wished I was different. The cheating part was only the confirmation those years sucked because almost every week, he would feel confused of his feelings for me. I was too cowardly to leave even though I was unhappy, because I was afraid no one else was out there. He said, body and face wise. I was attractive, but mentally, not since he could not have deep conversations with me. I got over him in one and a half month. That experience made me conclude that maybe I am not meant to find someone since I could not please men mentally. I am now in a new relationship, been together one year. Hes been the best of I could ever hope for, and not once did he ever make me feel he is confused of his feelings for me. He says, I am the best person heHas been with. However, I suffer from relationship anxiety whenever we have a minor misunderstanding, like he fell asleep for hours straight when he was supposed to call me. And I felt so anxious, it was so stupid. I told him that, and he was understanding, but I cannot help but feel this is making me unattractive to him. Not to mention it is super unhealthy. I know I need to get better, but I do not know where to start. Therapy is not an option for me right now, since I cannot afford it yet. It is my dream to be married to my true love and to have a happy family with him in the future. But I fear that my lack of confidence and hope is getting in the way of it. Sorry for the lack of coherence. In this text, I am a mess, and english is not my first language. I just really wanted a place to dump these unhealthy thoughts to do I feel like a mentally and emotionally weak person because of my fear of abandonment? I do not know if it is from my childhood experience or relationship history, or it is just innate, regardless. I just want to let this all out and hopefully get some advice. Thank you.

Title: Obsession, addiction with stalking partners. Ex needadvice.
Thread
My best friend is obsessed with her boyfriends ex. Its like she cares about her more than her actual boyfriend. Shes become obsessive about multiple people, all people she feels she does not measure up to, and it becomes all consuming. But this issue with this particular person has lasted for several years now. Its harmed her relationships. And according to her, all other areas of her life as well some of her habits, this is only stuff she is told me. So I can imagine there is moreconfusion checking her social media constantly like hourlyconfusion editing pictures of the ex face to be proportioned like her own features, and vice versa to see who is more attractiveconfusion, modifying her music taste, amp style of dress to more closely fit those of the ex spending hours searching for pics of her through google searches. Amp strangers accounts, storing hundreds yeshundredsconfusion of pics on her phone that she stares at, amp analyzes constantly her every decision, thought, amp action is informed by what this girl would do or approve of self harm in times where this feeling that shel never compare becomes too much for her post. From this girls social media sends her into a hate spiralself harm. Crying. Destructive eating habits are a few results. Shes told me that because of this girl she no longer wants to live feels that every good thing about her is only because she is copied. The other girl, but shel still never compare, has talked in jest aboutWanting to crawl into her skin. What might this obsession addiction confusion means about my friend? The issue is so deep and persistent that I am worried it is tied to some sort of mental illness. Shes been to therapy and did not get much support or commentary on the matter, but I am not sure how long she went or how much about the issue she shared, because I know she is very sensitive and secretive about it and cannot talk about it without becoming upset notes. She has an insecure attachment style with her mother. Shes told me her concern with the objects of her obsession has little to do with her boyfriends, but she has been cheated on before. So maybe some of the insecurity stems from thisconfusion shes and has struggled since she was about or what is going on with her? What would help has anyone seen or been through something this intense? I do not want to pathologize, but I want to help. Merit gets exhausting to deal with. But I love her frown, sad, angry or pouting

I am failing. As a student, a daughter, a friend, a person. And worst of all, I am failing myself. My mental health has almost completely deteriorated, and I am struggling to function physically and mentally. I am losing function of basic cognition, and my body feels weak. Maybe I am being a little dramatic, but it feels like I am dying. No medication has helped. Some have made me worse. I have tried saris, stimulants, mood stabilizers, blood pressure, beta blockers. I have gotten an mri on my brain that only showed that I get migraines. I get good sleep, I eat well, I exercise, I try affirmations, reading and nothing has worked. I am not suicidal. But I feel like this is the closest you can get to death. As a living being

I feel the exact same as you. I have gone through all you mentioned there. I failed myself in life, got my life destroyed while studying in uni and let myself down my family, my girlfriend, my friends, and lost everything I had in life. My mental health has been destroyed, and I am a living zombie ghost everyday. My brain is broken, as is my mind and spirit. I hope you will find some sort of peace in figuring yourself out and know you are not the only one with struggles in life. Things will hopefully get better for you

I have gotten an mri on my brain that only showed that I get migraines. I get good sleep, I eat well, I exercise, I try affirmations, reading and nothing has worked. I am not suicidal. But I feel like this is the closest you can get to death. As a living being

Anhedonia is the clinical term for this symptom and while its one of the criteria markers for the dam diagnosis of major depressive disorder one does not have to experience significant or prolonged anhedonia to be clinically depressed.

Title: Kickstarter for a childrens book about mental health that provides easily implemented tools for kids to use to feel safe and brave.
Thread
Hi, everyone. I hope this is ok to be posting here. I just wanted to share my kickstarter campaign to help fund illustrations and marketing for this story. I am deeply passionate about. The story is about a very nervous porcupine in a hot air balloon who has to use effective calming tools to prevent popping the hot air balloon. Through the process, he learns that being nervous is ok and normal and facing your fears can make you feel very brave.

Title: Been feeling scared about death lately for no reason. I just want to discuss things here to ease my mind.
Thread
So I am atheist and christian. I believe in god, but I believe everyone good hearted can go to heaven. I do not want to rant about my religious beliefs, because that is not the point I just want some explanation on this. When you die, it is forever nothingness. You cannot even comprehend the nothingness, right? You have no idea of anything who you once was what is occurring anything at all, basically. And that is just scary. The reason why I am atheist is due to things not making proper sense in the bible. To me, you have to be picture perfect to get into heaven essentially. And I just do not like that. It rubs me the wrong way again. I am not going to go in depth about my beliefs to not come across as annoying or anything I want there to be a heaven going to hell would even be okay, because at least I would be tortured, knowing my life and knowing who I was and my actions. I just cannot begin to understand just being gone

Title: How do you know when you are happy?
Thread
I am worried that I may not have the ability to experience happiness. I cannot think of a time in my life that I was ever happy. Even as a small child, my life has been very shitty, and I was abused through most of it. I experience emotions surrounding happiness like excitement. I remember a short period of my life that I felt content, maybe for about a monthconfusion. I laugh, sometimes, for example, I love my two cats, but do they make me happy or comforted? I cannot tell I smile and act happy, but I am truly starting to feel like I just do it to make other people comfortable. I mostly feel sadness, frustration, anger, embarrassment. I become overwhelmed easily. I prefer to be alone but crave connection. I have always been different. So how do you know when you are happy, even if it is just for a moment? Does anything really define happiness?

Has anyone on here felt like they are a bit lost and felt like they are in a consistent hole they cannot seem to get out of like I have a job and im working to build myself up after having a rough couple of months but I feel as though im wasting my life away by not doing the things I truly want to do im now and I have not achieved many things I want done, like going for my career path or working towards a house.

I have felt the same for the last two years now. Im right now, and it seems like time just passes by. I always feel like I am behind while others are graduating university, taking high wage jobs going on vacations. But I think if you are noticing right now that you are not really where you want to be at a young age right now, your way ahead of older, dumb people trust me. Plus, in todays world, it is much harder to land a job be of progressive credentialism and insane housing cost. I would say you still got time to improve

Title: Am I expecting too much from society?
Thread
One thing in particular is hugely confusing me and has for my entire life after knowing this level of abuse. So my mother, when I was young, sexually abused me. This started going on when I was younger than ten years old. There was so much extreme, other levels of excessive abuse going on outside of the sexual abuse. But for me, a parent sexually abusing a child is the end. All to any dignity in any adult person, sexual abusers deserve to die horribly sorry, not sorry. Many people rationalize in saying that people who sexually abuse kids were sexually abused themselves. But as a victim of childhood sexual abuse, trauma, I never ever have hurt a child fucking ever. I see such a terrifying level of rage in me when I even think about this topic at all. I scare myself with the level of rage that I feel during these times. To make a long story short, my social worker in foster care was the first person to tell me I was being sexually abused. I definitely always knew any event of this occurring would make me deeply sick at the pit of the deepest part of my gut, and that during each occurrence I felt an unexplainable level of fight or flight responses. But I was so young. When it started, despite those horrible feelings, I was not able to make full sense of. I thought that what I was dealing with was just the life I was going to live andThat this sort of thing must be common in the world because I guess nobody ever really told me it was not uncommon and I was being sexually abused at that same young age by so many other adult persons, too soin a fucked up way this was just normal, not good, no, but normal day to day reoccurring trauma over and over and that was all I knew in the world. Well flash forward I am now suffer from a lot of mental health issues that I am on disability for because I have not ever found a way to properly cope with some of it, and it manifests in some complex ways that I am consistently trying to work out every single day. I have learned that talking about and exposing the worst shit I know of life, no matter how uncomfortable is beneficial. And so I really have come a long way and been able to work through some things that at one point I never thought that I could. So I am proud of that. However, I truly believe that this shit will continue to effect me and continue to damage me for the rest of life in pretty big ways, because I cannot just pretend I did not experience extreme levels of trauma at far too young, two to three years old, even when it first began in my life. Well, it is made cresting any level of social relationship almost impossibletruly, because not only am I victim of so muchImmense damage. But so I moved my mother in with me because she was homeless and had two small dogs. And I do not care about my mother at all. Honest to god, the day she is dead will finally be the day I feel free from much of the weight of trauma I carry every fucking single daybut. She had dogs, and they are chihuahuas, and she is not responsible and does not take care of them. She hardly feeds them and sometimes flips out and hurts them, because animals are viewed as possessions, and I could not take them for her. I foolishly took on the burden of allowing her to sign my lease and be here under the guise that she work towards finding her own place quickly because those dogs did not deserve her as an owner, and they did not deserve to suffer and starve and fall victim to her abuse if I could help ease their burden, because I truly believe that animals are the only gentle souls left to this earthive done, years and years of animal rescue, volunteer work, and have so much compassion for the unadulterated love that a lot of animals are capable of having. Despite animal ownership, being a possessive relationship, many animals will show so much willingness to forgive even to their abusers. And I could not just watch this woman walk away with those dogs I did not have that strength. Now she is living here for over a year. Its so toxic.Theres people we have met mutually, who are close to us, but a fair percentage of the closest of them I hold dearbut, am questioning if that is what I should be doing, because I have confounded in a few of them about the abuses of a sexual nature that I have had to go through at her handstand. They say that it is horrible and at least superficially show that they support me. But I cannot feel that it is at all real, because every single one of those people is friends with my mother as well. I cannot understand how someone can do that. If I heard that from a person, regardless of whether or not I knew the abuser before knowing that they were abusers, I would immediately write that individual off so quickly any feelings of friendship would have disappeared instantly, with not a question at all. Instead, I hear, I love both of you. I do not want to get in the middle, except, I have literal documentation of all of the abuse done to me, regardless of all she denies, and all that is been substantiated legally and can prove I am not simply attempting to deface her with, falsifies and have communicated that and had it on hand every time only for them to continue on with that. I love both of you. I do not want to be in the middle bullshit. At first, I thought that it must just be one or two or three individuals whoWere being flippant and insincere about loving the both of us either. One of us even. But no, I have been in such a place of crisis that I am trying to reach out to anyone to show me that I am not the only person who holds her accountable for her actions. I am not asking anyone to do what they do not want to. My internal conflict is stemming from the fact that people do not care at all, that she is done, that its like they hear about it and think, well, that is fine. What are your so upset about? But when I realized what was happening to me, I was told that the rest of society disapproved strongly, with sexual assault on a child, and that in regular society, people would naturally be in a place to want to exile someone who had done such a harmful, horrible thing. But thirty years it is been, and I have seen more individuals disregard it completely, despite all the pain they see me in. And after all, the pain she is caused to another person? Its making me question everything I thought I knew has everyone been just painting some pretty picture about caring about that shit? Am I just overreacting? Am I asking so much of the world when all I want is for anyone to just look at this situation and not want to maintain a friendship with a person who has hurt someone these people claim to love so muchAnd if I am the one in the wrong please fucking someone tell me because I cannot comprehend any of these people being in such a careless spot knowing that they too know traumas of their own at least a god lot of them do they really love me like they claim if they are not as appalled by that abuse as I am do they I am on the spectrum and I am asking these things because I literally do not know how to read the world when I see things like that occur in my social relationships. Do these people care about me like they claim after I have been vulnerable enough to tell them about what I have gone through just to see them not even blink and eyelash in response to any of it? I have been just having to live with seeing it all happen like this so often that I feel this is going to be the regular response I get from anyone. Its been that consistent. And if maybe I am having to ask this to really get clarity and they do not care as they claim to, then I cannot say at all. I have ever met much of anyone in my life who did love me. And if that is the case, then if people do exist, who would change their feelings about my mother after hearing that she is caused so much abuse is continuing to cause immense levels of abuse. Still, regardless of whether orNot. I allowed her on my lease weakly, foolishlyconfusion. Then they must be extremely rare in society. As I have meet a lot of people in my life after the thirty years I have spent here, I am not sure I could truly stomach people saying to me that they care so much when they are so willing to disregard that level of damage and still entertain the abuser who caused it all. I am almost begging for anyone to give these individuals an excuse. So I am not walking myself right off the edge, but I do not want to be lied to either. I have got enough of that going on, that I am vigilant too. How would you feel if you were the individual who was told in confidence? This private matter? Would you disregard the situation as many others? Why? Whats the acceptable excuse for allowing yourself not to care more about that happening to a little kid like I said, I am almost hoping for anyone to give me an excuse for these people. So I do not just fucking break, but I need to know what other people feel about this situation, because I am blinded by trauma and rage, and I am able to accept that there is always a possibility that this has me blinded to some things, maybe, but until I hear a really good reason for others blowing that information off and still being just as normal with them as ever after the fact, but stillIn a place to say they give a real shit about me, because I cannot make rational sense of any of it. Maybe someone else can.

Title: I mess up all of my relationships laughing out loud.
Thread
I feel so motherfucking unlovable. No matter what I do, I look past so many flaws in a person, and they still do not look past mine. They never do. My major flaw is my borderline personality disorder. Why is it? I hand out unconditional love to my partners? But when its time for me to accept love, its with a fucking cost. I feel like theres no one out there for me that will ever understand. Yeah, I can get therapy. Yeah, I definitely try to be conscious of my flaws, but ill never be perfect or fixed, and its like everyone I meet, is looking for fucking perfect, like im never allowed to fuck up not even once and once, is all it always takes. But me, on the other hand, I give people unlimited amount of fuck ups, and im still afraid they will leave me, which they do. I guess its just my problem that I love unconditionally. But fuck, am I really the only one who does this? Why is it someone will see one flaw in me and abandon me? Bad feels like such a fucking curse, or is it that in todays world fucking up once equates toxic, lets say it does are toxic people not worthy of love? Do they just die alone? How do people not see that as heartless? Because at the root of it all, most of the time, toxic people are not trying to harm, they are trying desperately to fill something within themselves.That aside. I dont think I am toxic. I think I need just a little bit more work and someone that understands that it isnt going to be a fucking perfect journey.

Depends on the therapist, but generally, for me no, they all say the same things, and I hate the baby voice they all do. I do not have any problems opening up because I figure they already know anyway, but they always do the same things. Just dont do that exercise. Go outside, blah, go to one to talk out things with someone. But it is always just you answering your own questions anyway. Ya know?

I would say its a random coin toss depends on how much you are willing to change yourself to the point you are not even you a unique individual. For me, personally, its benefit was minimal. Throughout the therapy, I realised that I am very much capable of forming the suitable and logical solutions for said issues only if I stop playing the victim card, no matter how bad the back story trauma is, sans the hundreds of dollars invested in it.

I care. Waay too much about what other people think of me online.

When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently. Seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem. Instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain and you feel better. Also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts, count your blessings and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication. Don overlook stress management. It can help even with very bad anxiety. Video, a lot of helpful information, including the part program of brown and gerbarg

Title: Depression is not just sadness

A lot of people seem to think that depression is like how they feel when their favorite show ends or they get dumped or, etc. Its not depression is losing the ability to enjoy nice weather. Its spending your most important moments your graduation, your wedding, your childs birth, holding back tears of sorrow rather than joy. Its finding the to shows, books, hobbies, foods and activities you used to enjoy as boring as watching paint dry. Its feeling so exhausted.

Title: Stress is getting the better of me. I do not know what I am doing.
Thread
Hey, I was hoping I could get help from people in a similar situation or advice or anything I confusion and my now ex girlfriend, confusion broke up last month after a couple months of relationship, everything was great, and I found someone who truly understood me. I wanted to help her help her grow, be by her side. And all of a sudden my life felt like it was going somewhere. We re both from france and moved to canada for work, and I had met her once in france before we met again. A few months later, I immediately fell in love with her. I felt so much compassion, so much understanding for everything she did said and felt. After a few weeks of timid flirting, including a night we spent together, we did not even do anything. We just stayed up talking until, like confusion, I confessed to her and we immediately started a pretty intense relationship. I did not realize things were going a bit fast for me because I just wanted to spend every single second with her. I distinctly remember at one point, I truly felt like she was my soulmate. I loved our long discussions, and it felt not like we were exchanging, but almost like we were catching up on the time we did not spend together, if that makes. Sense. But my anxiety got the better of me after a weird day where I felt like I was not myself. I was not having fun. I wantedTo be home, be alone and die in a corner for weeks. I started questionning my feelings until I was just a walking anxiety attack. I was so scared I could not enjoy most of our time together. Our plans stopped making sense to me. Everything made me angry. I just could not take that stress anymore. And in late january, I broke up with her. I did not enjoy anything anymore. My sex drive was and still is below zero. I feel like there is a wall behind me and the rest of the world. And since then, I am questionning everything she made me realize how wrong I was about a lot of things she made me want to change, even if I did not know what is. On the other end, I started seeing a therapist, and it makes everything a little more tolerable, but I still feel greed out. She turned my whole world inside out, and it is making me do work on my deepest seated issues like never anyone before her made me want to do it terrifying. I feel lost, burned out, but I know I cannot go back, but still I miss her. Neither of us is in a very good place. We both miss our home country, but we still miss each other. I still have a lot of stress, and I do not have any feelings towards anything or anyone friends or family. I am living life in third person, but I still want to talkTo her, have long conversations with her, chat about stupid things together, watch a show, cuddle everything. She a fantastic person, someone I truly understand and who understands me back, someone who sees me and loves me for who I am, someone I think about constantly. We contacted each other again, and we will most likely meet again in a few weeks to see what we can do. But I am very scared. I miss her. I think I love her, but everything is grey and obscured, and I do not want to hurt her anymore. I want to be happy with her, make her laugh and feel at ease and as confident as the times she fell asleep in my arms, knowing we are both safe with each other. I cannot talk about her without my friends telling me I am being adorable and sappy, and that makes me feel like I can do it. But the stress and the dullness scare me am I able to do this? Should I do this? Is it the right thing? Do I truly love her? I know I was not in the best place when we started getting close, but I have had a crush on her for a while. And I know I got close to her because we are both nerds, because we had a pretty deep emotional connection, and because we simply cared a lot about each other and had similar experiences with life, if anything, I probably would have loved her more ifI was in a better place when we met I am switching between waves of stress and waves of I can do this. I feel that beautiful feeling again but I am honestly just really scared she a very intense and intelligent person and it is my first experience dating as an adult so this is all very scary to me I want to think I am on the right path but I need help. I need advice. I hope all of this made sense. Thank you for reading.

My diet and sleep schedule are still the same. I not falling behind in school, nor have I lost interest in hobbies or things I enjoy. I just feel like a ticking time bomb that is about to go off.

I feel like I have no one to turn to. That sounds silly, because I have a few close friends and family, of course. But this is a feeling that I do not know how to explain to any of them.

A lot of what you described could potentially count as symptoms of known disorders or not, as things are quite subjective. One key point for any dam disorder is that these symptoms cause clinically significant distress to the individual.

You might want to look into burnout. It is very similar to depression, but with small, key differences. If you are concerned, you might look into talking to a therapist or school counselor. They might be able to answer questions and or give you advice on what to do going forward.

I have been gaslit, barked at, had things thrown at me, insulted, gossiped about, and so on so forth by mental health professionals. Typically, when people hold power over you, in some way, there are those who abuse it. And I have been through enough experiences to know that many of those can be found working mental health.

It depends by how much time they last. If it is a extended period of time, it means that there is definitely something going on. If they last less, then weeks. It means that you do not have any mental illnesses.

I cannot stop thinking and analyzing my problems, even when I found a cause and solutions. I keep my mind busy until late night, feeling stuck to my problems.

Are you able to distract yourself with anything? Do you have any particular hobbies or anything? Maybe just writing things down or doing something to help get your mind off of things, especially some easy to do things, maybe colouring, drawing, exercising, watching movies, writing or things like that, which you can do anywhere I understand. Its not really as simple as that. And you have likely tried. Maybe just take some time for yourself.

Hello, everyone. So I started a new job last week, and I feel like I am not progressing at all. I have started working as a he. And I feel like I am useless and most dumb person in my office, I feel like I am disappointing my mentor. I have been getting anxiety attacks before going to work, and I cry everyday because I feel like things are not working in my favour, and I am not learning from my mistakes. I took a leave today just after week of joining because of my anxiety. I just wanted to stay at home because as soon as woke up, I had really bad anxiety, and I started crying. But now my anxiety has got worse. Staying at home because I am continuously thinking of my pending work and what my mentor and colleagues must be talking a little background. This is not my first job, but my first job gave me a terrible trauma, because they fired me within days of joining, and told me how useless I was. I faced daily harassment. In my first job, I was told I will be getting fired on my the day. If I did not work properly, I was also a he in my first job, and they expected me to show good results. On my and day of joining it was a terrible company. It was a start up. But now I am constantly in a fear that the same things are going to be repeat again.In the new company I joined if I do not show them results and I also suffer from anxiety disorder and depression I was in therapy but left it because it was to costly and could not afford it but I am thinking to start the therapy again as soon as I receive my first salary and I hope my new company will not fire me for taking a day off I just need advice how to handle things properly

A few techniques that have helped me I try to view work as theater. Were all hired to play roles. It is like a daily performance. I also try to stay in love with my craft, but not tie my identity to the employer. All jobs have a way of sucking, even good jobs. We work for the money. But if money were not a factor, would we ever choose to work? Its important to be reliable, more than a hustler when starting a new role. Spend more time listening and observing than talking. Your best self comes through when you embrace a lack of perfection, do your best, but do not hurt yourself. Trying too hard, you can do it

Title: I cannot believe how much time money and effort I invest into trying to improve my life with next to no results.
Thread
Just a bit of a rant. As the title says, I put a lot of time money and effort into trying to improve my life, not just mental health, but small things, too. That bother or inconvenience me. And it seems like nothing I do makes a positive difference, actually, a lot of the time. It makes things worseconfusion, it, no wonder I feel unmotivated to do anything about my problems. When I finally decide I have had enough of something, do something about it and then realize my efforts were useless. It discourages me from trying again. I am time and money conscious between physical and mental health. I have next to no energy going anywhere, doctor offices, pharmacies for groceries and gas is not only very tiring, but also stressful for me. I am supposed to be middle class, as I make about in a year, yet I am lucky to have left at the end of the month. And the scary thing is, I do not really do or buy anything, and it just keeps getting worse out there. My grocery bill has gone from we to a week. Gas has gone from a week to a week. Internet will go up. Another math this summer, my rent for a soft ground floor apartment on the edge of the urban area is about ads of my monthly income, and I see room rentals going for a month and you have to share a kitchen and bathroom. Sad thing is that after rent, myFortnightly therapy sessions are my highest expense due to this, and the fact that so much of what I have tried in the past has failed. I am reluctant to spend more time and money on things what the point I find myself thinking you just lose more time and money and be more stressed. But I am constantly plagued by the fact I cannot live like this. So I start getting into improvement. Phases dropped on a light therapy lamp this month have used it everyday. Seen no effect dropped another on a wireless bra since wired ones dig in to the point of causing bruises red marks in the center of my chest. One retailer said it was because I have a tilted rib cage and suggested taping cotton balls to all the bras. Wireless bra was the most awkward garment I have ever had the misfortune of trying on now I am stressed out about how, when and where I am going to return it I did yoga for about two and a half years. Almost every day doctor recommended it said it would lessen my pain and strengthen my muscles saw no improvement, still could not hold a plank for a minute. After all, that time could not do crow pose could not raise my leg above my head was sore, gross and tired. Every day back, acne got worse, felt super time consuming, although thankfully, did not use up a ton of money. As I just did it at home, iHave never left a hair salon happy with how my cut turned out and have, on multiple occasions, either had my mother take scissors to it immediately after getting home due to how uneven it was corrected it myself, or had to wear my hair up for weeks on end, until it grew out to an appropriate length. Because somehow, despite warning the hairdresser that my hair will curl up and shrink when dry, they still cut it too short. How many diet changes and natural remedies over the counter? Meds and prescriptions have I tried for my adenomyosis that was only finally diagnosed a few months agoconfusion. How many thousands of dollars have I spent on acne and eczema treatments, both prescribed and over the counter? How many months have I waited for dry appointments, diagnostic appointments, psychiatrist, appointments therapist, appointments? How many days off did I need to take for these tests and appointments? Or because the medication made me ill? I flunked a midterm once, because despite specifically starting a new anti depressant during reading week with no side effects. A week later night before the midterm, and I was up all night shaking, sweating and feeling like I was going to puke, I stick with things. I change things up. It does not seem to matter. Things do not improve. I pick something really small, like wanting to have neater hand writing. I spend a whole summer practicing, every day doing templates, reading tips and watching videos, buying proper pens and paperPracticing by journaling a page a day, nothing but a sore wrist, and writer callus to show for it, I am sick of it. Part of me says, just give in, stop trying. You save yourself a lot of stress, time and money. Life sucks. And trying to change that fact just makes it worse, in part because it reminds you how hopeless it is. And another part of me wants to have hope, take a long term, leave from work, and just start throwing myself at doctors, saying, fix me. I do whatever you say, go for tests, try, meds, change diets and routines, just make me stop hurting this much. Because at the end of the day that is what it comes down to. I know life could get worse. It is proven that to me plenty of times, but I am not as scared of what might happen that I might end up alone and unloved, unemployed, further disabled, etc. Confusion than I am, of what is happening. Now, when you start with a new therapist, they tend to ask, what brings you to therapy? And for me, it is always been the same. I do not want to feel like this anymore.

I spent years of my life trying to manage my cos, and the only thing that helped was doing a ketogenic diet. I also spent a lot of money on doctors, lost count of how many ignorant, yet dangerous doctors I have seen as a consequence. I learned a lot about health and how nutrition impacts the human body and learned how completely unnatural is the way we eat. Now I also had acne for more than a decade that is gone too. Sometimes efforts are misdirected, but you can always change direction. The only solution to your problem is to learn how to read the science by yourself and discern between is and truth. You will be surprised by what you find

One retailer said it was because I have a tilted rib cage and suggested taping cotton balls to all the bras. Wireless bra was the most awkward garment I have ever had the misfortune of trying on now I am stressed out about how, when and where I am going to return it I did yoga for about two and a half years. Almost every day doctor recommended it said it would lessen my pain and strengthen my muscles saw no improvement, still could not hold a plank for a minute. After all, that time could not do crow pose could not raise my leg above my head was sore, gross and tired. Every day back, acne got worse, felt super time consuming, although thankfully, did not use up a ton of money. As I just did it at home, iHave never left a hair salon happy with how my cut turned out and have, on multiple occasions, either had my mother take scissors to it immediately after getting home due to how uneven it was corrected it myself, or had to wear my hair up for weeks on end, until it grew out to an appropriate length. Because somehow, despite warning the hairdresser that my hair will curl up and shrink when dry, they still cut it too short. How many diet changes and natural remedies over the counter? Meds and prescriptions have I tried for my adenomyosis that was only finally diagnosed a few months agoconfusion. How many thousands of dollars have I spent on acne and eczema treatments, both prescribed and over the counter? How many months have I waited for dry appointments, diagnostic appointments, psychiatrist, appointments therapist, appointments? How many days off did I need to take for these tests and appointments? Or because the medication made me ill? I flunked a midterm once, because despite specifically starting a new anti depressant during reading week with no side effects. A week later night before the midterm, and I was up all night shaking, sweating and feeling like I was going to puke, I stick with things. I change things up. It does not seem to matter. Things do not improve. I pick something really small, like wanting to have neater hand writing. I spend a whole summer practicing, every day doing templates, reading tips and watching videos, buying proper pens and paperPracticing by journaling a page a day, nothing but a sore wrist, and writer callus to show for it, I am sick of it. Part of me says, just give in, stop trying. You save yourself a lot of stress, time and money. Life sucks. And trying to change that fact just makes it worse, in part because it reminds you how hopeless it is. And another part of me wants to have hope, take a long term, leave from work, and just start throwing myself at doctors, saying, fix me. I do whatever you say, go for tests, try, meds, change diets and routines, just make me stop hurting this much. Because at the end of the day that is what it comes down to. I know life could get worse. It is proven that to me plenty of times, but I am not as scared of what might happen that I might end up alone and unloved, unemployed, further disabled, etc. Confusion than I am, of what is happening. Now, when you start with a new therapist, they tend to ask, what brings you to therapy? And for me, it is always been the same. I do not want to feel like this anymore.

Title: I want to die.
Thread
My brain is yelling at me, get the gun and shoot yourself. I have resorted back to cutting, which I was clean over a year with. I am just done. Fighting is hard. Therapy is not helping. The world is going to shit. I tried. I have tried everything I tried, setting a boundary so that I am not thrown back to the abuse of my childhood. And apparently, that makes me a horrible person. I am a burden on my husband. I am not a good mom, I have no friends, I have no family, I will never make a difference. My life is meaningless. Just turn it off. Just turn it off.

Are they going to put me in a mental hospital? I really do not want to go to one. I do not think I need to. I just do not know how this stuff works.

Youll be fine. You have to want to heal basically to protect itself. Your brain has come up with a bunch of strange stress reactors and coping mechanisms. Theres a problem you need to find the root of the problem and work through it in order to become a better you and work through it. Humans are not as invincible as we like to think youre young as much as you think you have been around and know what lifes all about you probably dont. It took me until I was to really come to terms with a lot of shit and start working through it. Theres nothing wrong with you there honestly probably is not anyone alive that is free from mental struggles. Its about exploring daily, becoming a better you processing it might be that you are stuck in a shit situation right now, but keep your head up and try to find some people you trust to talk things through. Good luck. You do not want to die. It is likely this twisted little stress reaction, fight or flight. Sometimes, everything sucks hard and thinking like that comes easy, not worth it. Work on. Staying in the moment and bettering yourself start a journal and take notes on thoughts that trigger you or memories that bother you. It is helpful to see when you become upset and ask yourself why it can also be a great help to the therapist when you get to them. I am not on all the time, butIf you ever need a mystery person to vent, to feel free to message me.

Title: What are the consequences of a therapists diagnosis?

What happens if a therapist diagnoses me as schizophrenic or a schizo affective disorder? Will that label stick with me? My concern is losing the freedom of driving, owning guns or getting certain jobs in the future.

In the us, your diagnosis only goes in your private medical record and insurance. If you use itconfusion, which you can choose to not share with anybody else, like an employer or the dev. If this was done through a hospital system versus private practiceconfusion, it will remain in your chart as long as you receive care. There. In some states, involuntary mental health commitment by a judges order can result in being put on a list where you cannot buy or own a firearm, but that is a very specific action.

Title: Is something wrong with me?
Thread
Sorry to make another post about my mom death. This should be the last one, as you can see, if you look at my account. My mom passed away yesterday. Now, this is not the first time I have lost a loved one. It happened two other times, one when I was and another when I was. Those two deaths really hit me hard and put a halt my development. However, my mom death has not been affecting me as much. I do not know if it is the fact I have dealt with grief before or if I still have not processed what is happened, but I have not been feeling how I thought I would. It, like, all the big emotions came the day of her death, and now I am fine. I still miss her and are upset about her death, but it has not been very life changing. Is there something wrong with me? I know it may be too early to tell how this is going to affect me, but I figured I would ask this in case it could be sign of something else.

I will keep this short, but basically I have been struggling for many years with anxiety and depression. Its gotten much worse lately, and I am finally ready to seek help. My question is, do I make a therapy appointment first? Or psychiatrist? I would like to get a diagnosis of what exactly is wrong with me but also want to just talk to someone. I have never done any of this, so I do not know what to expect. Thanks.

Title: Ink how to caption this.
Thread
My mental health issues started about midway through highschool and have only been getting worse into my adult life. It not just one thing either. I have manic bipolar depression, crushing social anxiety, manic suicidal thoughts and severe paranoia towards everyone and everything. I used to be the chill stoner in my group, and now I have friends, and im just a nervous mess. I have made alot of stupid decisions that have not made it any better. I have been essentially removed from my family because they did not want to deal with it. And now im stuck in a room all day alone. I am married and have explained in great detail what is wrong with me. But she is not exactly understanding of how close I am to blowing my head off. If I do not get help. The way she views people who are suicidal is more hateful than understanding

Title: Feel like my friend is about to abandon me.
Thread
I do not know what more to say than that. I guess we have been friends for a while but only started hanging out once I dropped out since everyone else just left me. She kept taking to me despite her being in school and me not my adolescence up to this point has just been a series of rejection, betrayal and abandonment, and it is really bothering me. I talk to her usually over snap, and she was usually really good about replying within the day. I do not know if there is tests or something over there or she has a job. She does not really tell me anything of what is happening in her life. Usually she is just nice and supportive and likes my creativity and jokes, and I mean, she seems genuine enough. I just do not know what is happening. She has not said anything to me in days. I am worried that suddenly we might be drifting apart, and then I will only have friends left, but they are not very consistent, either. Themselves. I hate this cycle right now, and I just wish I knew what was going on, and I hope I am just worrying, and that everything is okay and that there is a logical answer to this, and we are still friends

Title: What to do with all this mental health awareness.
Thread
In any given year about in adults suffers from a diagnosable mental illness, with many people affected by more than one cooccurring mental disorder. At a time, nearly of american adults will deal with a depressive illness, major depression, bipolar, etc. Confusion. And almost in adults will deal with an anxiety disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety, post traumatic stress disorder, etc. Confusion. You almost assuredly know, at least one person whose life has been in some way affected by mental illness some lives more than others. According to the I department of housing and urban development, on any given night, in approximately, people were experiencing homelessness of that number, at least of these people had a serious mental illness and had any mental illness among the general population, about of adults have any mental illness while around suffer from a serious mental illness, meaning both categories are heavily overrepresented in the homeless population. Homelessness might be considered an extreme case, but mental illness does not discriminate your friends. Family. Neighbors and coworkers are not immune to mental health woes in june of adults reported new or increased substance use related to couid and reported thoughts of suicide within the last days, and couid has led to increases in adults experiencing stress anxiety, depression and other mood disorders, not to mention the collective trauma we are all experiencing. If you were not already aware of these numbers, you are now so great so you are aware your awareness of mental health is increasing, you re possibly moreAware of the problem than you previously were. And that is good. Heck, it is great. My personal awareness of pop has gone from not at all aware a few years ago to it is a thing I know exists, and I kind of know some things about it. My awareness has increased, and pop continues to exist, just like mental illness goes right on existing, pure awareness of a problem absent accompanying action to address aforementioned problem is useless, and for many, it feels like that is where we currently stand in addressing our country. Mental health problems. People are more aware of mental illness existence. Its prevalence, its effects and symptoms. Even some of the more systemic issues with access to care staffing, shortages, care shortages and things like homelessness and veterans healthcare as they relate to mental health, significant strides are being made in the effort to destigmatize mental illness, especially with gen and seeking out. Mental health services is not seen as the shameful act it once was. And that is wonderful. That is absolutely fantastic. But what do we do with all this awareness? It fantastic that I feel more comfortable talking about my mental illness, but I still have to wait three months or more to get an appointment with a psychiatrist. How do we turn awareness into meaningful action to improve the lives of the mentally ill in, of the adults with a mental illness less than half drunk or confused, received mental health services and only of youngAdults confusion received mental health services. Of those with a serious mental illness, adults still only received mental health services, and young adults were again worse off with only receiving treatment or other mental health services. Access to mental health care is a significant problem in the united states. And though things like the affordable care act have led to improvements, the situation is still far from ideal over of adults with a mental illness, more than remain uninsured, making it nearly impossible to afford the care they need. In some places, it is even worse. With of wyoming mentally ill going without health insurance, and it is not as simple as just getting insurance in of adults with a mental illness received no treatment. There are many reasons someone might not be able to access treatment, including no insurance or not enough insurance shortages in mental health professionals, especially in rural areas. Lack of access to appropriate treatment, inability to pay for care, increasing difficulties in qualifying for programs meant to improve access and coverage, and more increased awareness of the importance of mental health, the existence of mental illness and how to recognize mental health issues all promote seeking help, receiving mental health services and care. Recognizing and addressing mental health needs. Sadly, recognizing the need and seeking out mental health services does not guarantee the ability to actually access mental health services, and that is where awareness falls short. Many mental illnesses occur on a spectrum, meaning those living with mental illness experienceA range of symptoms and severity at both the macro and micro levels. By this, I mean, a depressed person is not constantly the same level of depressed and the symptoms they experience will vary over time and in severity. I also mean that depressed people as a population are not uniformly depressed and do not all experience identical symptoms. For instance, not everyone with depression is driven to suicide, but many of them struggle with experiencing suicidal thoughts. As such, the need for mental health services, even for an individual, is not always constant. Many with mental illness will experience periods of increased and diminished severity of symptoms with an accompanying increased or diminished need for mental health services. Unfortunately, the current state of mental health services is not designed for flexibility and accommodation, with patients often waiting months to see a mental health professional. This is further complicated by incomplete or nonexistent insurance coverage for mental health services. With restrictions on providers, visit frequency, medication coverage, age, differentiated coverage plans, and more projections from the health resources and services administration suggest an imminent, exponential and immense shortage of mental health professionals in the coming years, with demand slated to far outweigh supply by shortages make it more difficult to find care access. Providers high burnout among providers and increasingly long waits for sometimes life saving treatment. Access to necessary care is even worse. Among some of the most vulnerable america youth, nearly of young americans with major depression receive no mental health treatment withOnly about of youth with severe depression receive even a modicum of consistent treatment a minimum of visits a year. As someone who once was a depressed youth and young adult I can tell you I am much better equipped to deal with my mental illness now than when I was younger. Research shows that of people who commit suicide have a known mental health condition children experiencing homelessness are three times more likely to commit suicide than those living at home with a parent or guardian. The suicide rate among those experiencing homelessness is ten times higher than among the general population. Additionally, it is been shown that homelessness can be an exacerbating factor and partial cause of mental illness. Suicide is the second leading cause of death for children adolescents and young adults aged and more than half of young americans with major depression continue to receive no treatment. What are we doing with all this awareness? So things are kind of terrible. I have hopefully made you a bit more aware than you previously were, but that is nothing by itself. So what do I want you to do with your newfound increased shiny and new awareness? Bring it to bear in elections in your views of public policy and social services remember it when you are trying to decide whether or not to support universal healthcare. When you see congress try to impose earning caps on travel nurses when thedacare sues nurses to try and stop them from taking another job, iWant you to write, call, tweet, email and send carrier pigeons to your elected representatives, telling them you support increasing access to mental health services, making it easier for those in need to get the help and care required. Recognizing mental illnesses as just as real a disability as physical disabilities and increasing supports for our children, students and youth who are going horribly underserved. I selfishly want everyone to stop telling depressed people to go outside or try positive thinking. I want people to demand substantive changes to our country. Mental health infrastructure to demand increased access, modernized policies and care and research into promising treatments. I want the fda to ease restrictions on drugs like mdma, ketamine and psilocybin, all of which have shown incredible potential as treatments for multiple mental disorders. I want action, and I want you to help to vote, to tell our elected representatives we have enough awareness. What we are lacking is action statistics and other information found here edited for readability.

Title: How do I eat healthy and more often?
Thread
Trigger warning food issues. I posted this on selfimprovement as well, but figured this might be a good place to ask, too. I come seeking some advice about how to have a better relationship with food. I hate eating, and sometimes forget about it altogether, not because of body image issues or anything it just feels time consuming and lackluster. To say the least, I do not ever really love the taste of food, though rarely I do enjoy it. Some. I am also very picky and would rather not eat than eat something that does not sound good. So eating vegetables can be challenging at times, there are some outside factors that go along with this. I grew up in extreme poverty in us standardsconfusion, with a neglectful mother. So growing up, I ate malt meal, scrambled eggs and ramen. When she felt inclined to cook, I had hamburger helper. Thats it. Sometimes none of that was even available. So I just did not eat for extended periods of time. I had fish for the first time when I was around, and I still need to google what certain vegetables are when they pop up in a recipe, its definitely frustrating. I also despise cooking. It takes up so much time requires so many dishes, and in the end, I am not even that satisfied. Regardless of whether the food tastes good or not. On top of all that, I have a plethora of mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, depression and inattentive adhd. SoBasically everything feels like a chore, always. How can I improve my relationship with food? How can I go about eating more? Sometimes I do not even realize it is been over hours since I have eaten until I start shaking and feeling faint. Even then, I do not feel hungry. I just logically come to the conclusion that it is probably time to eat.

Acute inpatient is focused on safety i, suicide, psychosisconfusion and stability. I start medsconfusion. It tends to be brief days average in usaconfusion, and the goal is for people to return safely back to independent living quickly and continue their outpatient treatment.

Title: Lost myself trying to be someone im not.
Thread
Hey, everybody. Im. I ve found myself in a strange situation where, for the past year, ive just been behaving doing and acting like my cool, big cousin. I was never like this before and didnt give a toss about what he or anyone would do or think about me, and was myself. It was only until someone had mentioned how cool he was in his heyday girls, money, cars, etc. So I had the assumption I would be remembered for being a nobody who didnt care about designer clothes and nice cars or anything like that. So I decided to start getting into all that kind of stuff in the past year and behave thuggish and swagger like even down to walking and talking like he does or did in the past. I just feel like shit, because I saw an old pic compared to me today where I was fat and clueless and just chilling, whereas now im trying to be all cut and wear, the best brands, etc. In a way, its a good change, but also bad, because its not me. Even my music taste has changed into badboy rap stuff. I guess I want to be remembered as cool in the future. Aswell. Thats why. But it all doesnt feel very geniuene and real. But my real self was a fat slob who didnt care about what I wore or smelled like, or anything lol. I used to be into spiritual and philosophy stuff, aswell. But dont talk about it toAvoid looking and sounding nerdy, I just do stuff I would assume big cousin would do. Obviously not everything he does, though, as he has been to prison numerous times, please help, any answers would be appreciated. I heard jim carry say, depression is your soul telling you, its tired of the avatar you re trying to portray.

The title of this? Can I just point out the obvious as for the substance, dont be so hard on yourself you are still in the process of learning who you are humans, mic other humans and become individuals along the way just because you changed does not mean who you used to be is the entirety of who you should be but clearly you realize that there may be a point to stop and retrace a bit because you are not your cousin either. Thats a good thing. So pay attention to your feelings right now you can take the better aspects of both sides and become your own person, one that you like being

Title: Lost myself trying to be someone im not.
Thread
Hey, everybody. Im. I ve found myself in a strange situation where, for the past year, ive just been behaving doing and acting like my cool, big cousin. I was never like this before and didnt give a toss about what he or anyone would do or think about me, and was myself. It was only until someone had mentioned how cool he was in his heyday girls, money, cars, etc. So I had the assumption I would be remembered for being a nobody who didnt care about designer clothes and nice cars or anything like that. So I decided to start getting into all that kind of stuff in the past year and behave thuggish and swagger like even down to walking and talking like he does or did in the past. I just feel like shit, because I saw an old pic compared to me today where I was fat and clueless and just chilling, whereas now im trying to be all cut and wear, the best brands, etc. In a way, its a good change, but also bad, because its not me. Even my music taste has changed into badboy rap stuff. I guess I want to be remembered as cool in the future. Aswell. Thats why. But it all doesnt feel very geniuene and real. But my real self was a fat slob who didnt care about what I wore or smelled like, or anything lol. I used to be into spiritual and philosophy stuff, aswell. But dont talk about it toAvoid looking and sounding nerdy, I just do stuff I would assume big cousin would do. Obviously not everything he does, though, as he has been to prison numerous times, please help, any answers would be appreciated. I heard jim carry say, depression is your soul telling you, its tired of the avatar you re trying to portray.

Title: I literally havent spoken to anyone for more than months and cant for the next months, and it has caused me to suffer from bad depression.
Thread
Around months ago, I got expelled, and due to my situation, I had to do homeschooling. This means that I have had no one to talk or interact with due to the nature of why I got expelled. I cannot talk to any of my friends, and neither do they want to talk to me. What can I do to fix this? It literally feels like torture. I have become extremely depressed and lost all motivation to do anything. I just sit at home all day on my phone, doing nothing and hating myself. Even worse, since my tutors work at schools, it means that they come from around am, and it means I cannot attend any after school activities or any clubs, please. Can someone recomend me anything? An interest, a way to find friends? Literally anything? Thank you.

I do not know if its imposter syndrome, but that is what my friend mentioned. Thanks for letting me vent. I hope you have a beautiful and productive day reader

It would not surprise me if this anxiety you are talking about stems from the adhd. I give you some info about both. Adhd expert and author do russell barkley has a number of youtube videos. You can check barkley impressive credentials at his wikipedia article, the adult adhd toolkit by tony rostane co authorconfusion, a cut approach. Also advocacy and support groups such as chad can be helpful. A relationship between adhd and insomnia has been found and treatment with the supplement melatonin has been shown to help. There is evidence that relaxation with the traditional asian methods can help with adhd psychiatrists brown and gerbarg, who have published papers on breathing and mental health, recommend a part program of mind body methods, breathing, meditation and slow body movement. Incorporate these into your daily life. Be aware of changes in mood and respond, mindfully aware of your breathing details. Here, when we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down brown and gerbarg say a, or min, slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale, gently. Seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about theDifferent ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain and you feel better.

Title: Never had any mental energy.
Thread
Ever since I was a kid, I never had the mental or physical energy to exceed. I manage to do the bare minimum. But as soon as I get to put in work into something important, I drain myself in minutes, I get sleepy feeling my limbs light and cannot keep up with nobody. It like my body refuses to cooperate. It not something recent, like I said, I have been like this since childhood. As far as I can remember, I do bloodwork and yearly doctor check every february, and there has never been anything physical that suggest a problem with me. I do have anxiety, suffer from overthinking, diagnosed with depression, and add so I think it must be something in my brain. What do you think

Please bare with me as I try to articulate my circumstance here amp I am and have been diagnosed with mental illness since I was I have been medicated for a lot of my life but stopped taking meds as an adult at some point I ve been on and off of so many meds that I actually do not remember the entire timeline plus my memory is not working very well currently confusion I started lexapro about years ago now and it worked like a dream right from the start I got back into school about a year after starting the lexapro and the stress got to me I upped the dose but it was not enough. So we added welbutrin after taking welbutrin for days, I was on the verge of a psychotic break. I could tell I was not thinking normally I cannot retain what I read experiencing staring spells with completely blank thoughts and face. I was believing things that are not true. Example my thoughts kept centering around my family secretly hating me and that I should quit school now before I get into more debt. Then thoughts of I have trained myself to drop everything I am doing and get help when the I thoughts enter my mind because I know as a rule no one should be having those thoughts. These changes happened very quickly, too. Probably less than hours between me having a normal day and feeling like I would be better off dead, that why I amConvinced I need help now, and not when someone can measure my mental illness by the destruction to my own life. We stopped the welbutrin and started buspar. The beginning days of the new meds were fine. But now, days later, I am having all these horrible symptoms again. My thoughts and body feel like someone else. I am struggling all the time not to dissociate from reality, constant mental dissonance. I cannot do my homework because it might as well be written in a language I just started learning so now that my grades have plummeted, I have always been able to learn so quickly, but I cannot even read for comprehension. Currently, it crushing meconfusion and I cannot steer my own thoughts. I have tried to reach out for help. I be calling my go again tomorrow morning. In the meantime, I have attempted to find local programs that will help me. Nothing exists around me for my situation. I can either go on a two week grippy sock vacation or see a therapist that wants to discuss their political views with me. Seriously, I have never had a therapist that would stay on track, or that even referenced my condition after the initial visit, we end up having ridiculous, small talk every single time does this happen to everyone? Confusion. I have been to the largest mental health center in our area with horrible results every time one therapist even fell with me in the room multiple times. While we were supposed toBe talking the same place. Different providerconfusion diagnosed me with major depression, at which I know now, is pretty bleak and unreasonable. I just do not know how to handle this. I know I need to ask for help, and I am trying to. Hopefully my go will have answers for me in the morning. If anyone has some input for me here, I would really appreciate it. Just writing the post was very cathartic, and I believe, bought me some more time to think and process.

The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It very important to calm down. This will make you feel better. And let you think clearly a very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical behavior therapy, which helps people who have bad recommends this breathe gently, hand on your belly, to feel it go in and out and breathe. Seconds in breath and seconds out breath till you feel ok. Article debt coping methods use any of these or combination

I do not know your whole story, but from what you wrote, I feel like all the meds you have been put on have done more harm than good. Can you remember how bad your depression was when you were bad enough that meds are necessary? Meds make physiatrists more money, and it sounds like the ones you have been to did not care much, not a good combination. I know several people in my life that have spiraled for the worse after going on meds

Schadenfreude. Are you being territorial and making sure they stay clear? Or are you purposely finding them and shoving it in their faces? This is a good opportunity to discover what your motivations are if there is something in your past, you are overcompensating for insecurity about something specific.

Title: I am lucky I did not watch reasons why before today.

I will vaguely describe a suicide scene from the show in this post if you are currently struggling with suicidal thoughts, please do not read even if you think you can handle it there. No point in risking it. When the show really started getting more and more people hooked, I was at my lowest. Thank god I was never interested in teen drama, because today I decided to watch it out of curiosity, and I am terrified. This is probably the worst thing that a suicidal person can watch. The scene of the suicide itself is probably the biggest issue, along with making it out to be a good way to get back at the people that hurt you even if it was a minor thing. The show is literally saying suicide will make them pay, make it cool and aesthetic with tapes and polaroids, it makes me sick. The suicide scene was tasteless and unnecessary. I am sure that if I saw that one back when I was extremely suicidal, it would be like porn for depressed people. Description starts here. Hannah baker, the subject of the whole season dies of hemorrhage in a bathtub from self inflicted cuts. The writers wanted to show how ugly suicide is by making it obvious that she was in a lot of pain that would have been fine. But after a while, they showed her getting calmer and calmer she looked at peace like it was a happy moment of release for her description ends here thatIs exactly what suicidal people think of death it does not help a single person to see hannah dying in this poetic and almost appealing manner this is sickening I admit I am not fully out of the hole yet but I am now able to look at suicidal thoughts more objectively to maybe understand them the scene did make me feel a sort of peaceful feeling that is deep inside of me it actually made me less scared of death which in this context is not a good thing do not watch this show it making suicide into this romantic aesthetic teen drama that turns into a murder mystery with ghosts and as someone whom this show wanted to protect, I feel insulted

Title: What will finally make me stop crying?
Thread
It been a year. I met someone long distance, where he and I talked almost everyday for five months but could not meet due to the pandemic. I stopped talking to him once I found out he was seeing someone in his city. They started a relationship, and it did not work out. And he messaged me again. Months later, I missed him everyday for those months and thought he came back because he missed me to. He told me, even though he was back, he was going to see other people. And let me know when he got into a relationship. I knew I could not handle my feelings for him and what he was doing. So I distanced myself. He continued to call amp text, but I kept putting off meeting him in person, as I figured he would meet someone in his city and forget about me. He probably was seeing someone in his city, but continued to insist on seeing me. He asked me when I was free, and he just bought a ticket and flew from texas to come see me in ny. This was a year after we started talkingconfusion. I kept my distance when he got here, but he kept pushing to drink with me, and we fooled around while I was drunk, did not have sexconfusion. The next day, he told me he did not want a relationship, flew back to texas and advertised a date, on his stories. The next day, he blocked me from viewing themAt some point he did not bother to talk to me again until months after he left when he saw there was some flooding in ny and messaged to ask if we were okay then he messaged me again months later to wish me happy birthday last year it been nearly a year since he left I got on the highest dose of medication, got into therapy even nearly committed suicide and spent a night in the psych ward I still cry almost every night I do not know what in the world will help me I miss him still as crazy as it sounds just tell me what I can do I practically told the guy I loved him and he made me feel like I am completely worthless to do intensely heartbroken need some help

Hey, I know it is really hard. Having someone who makes you feel loved and cared about and then losing them, it really can lead to a downfall in mental health. Do you have any friends or hobbies that could distract you? I would say, try and build new relationships. It hard to get over someone when you have nothing to replace them with. You need to stay strong. Aight keep pushing. I know it is horrible. I know it is hard, and you likely cannot cope, but things can get better. You just need to hold out. Try reaching out to loved ones. I am not sure about your current situation, but maybe try and get some pets or other things. They will not solve the issue, but they might help you feel better. I am here if you want to talk or rant about anything, and I hope you start feeling better sooner than later. I am so sorry for what you have had to go through

I will keep this short, but basically I have been struggling for many years with anxiety and depression. Its gotten much worse lately, and I am finally ready to seek help. My question is, do I make a therapy appointment first? Or psychiatrist? I would like to get a diagnosis of what exactly is wrong with me but also want to just talk to someone. I have never done any of this, so I do not know what to expect. Thanks.

If you want medication treatment only go with a psychiatrist, but your go might also be willing to prescribe for you if you want non med treatment only, then go with a therapist if you want both schedule with whoever can get you in first, both professions can come up with diagnostic impressions and or full diagnoses. If you want a thorough evaluation to only receive a diagnosis and treatment recommendations. Consider a psychologist. The above refers to the us as titles. Professions may operate a bit differently country by countryconfusion.

Months later, I missed him everyday for those months and thought he came back because he missed me to. He told me, even though he was back, he was going to see other people. And let me know when he got into a relationship. I knew I could not handle my feelings for him and what he was doing. So I distanced myself. He continued to call amp text, but I kept putting off meeting him in person, as I figured he would meet someone in his city and forget about me. He probably was seeing someone in his city, but continued to insist on seeing me. He asked me when I was free, and he just bought a ticket and flew from texas to come see me in ny. This was a year after we started talkingconfusion. I kept my distance when he got here, but he kept pushing to drink with me, and we fooled around while I was drunk, did not have sexconfusion. The next day, he told me he did not want a relationship, flew back to texas and advertised a date, on his stories. The next day, he blocked me from viewing themAt some point he did not bother to talk to me again until months after he left when he saw there was some flooding in ny and messaged to ask if we were okay then he messaged me again months later to wish me happy birthday last year it been nearly a year since he left I got on the highest dose of medication, got into therapy even nearly committed suicide and spent a night in the psych ward I still cry almost every night I do not know what in the world will help me I miss him still as crazy as it sounds just tell me what I can do I practically told the guy I loved him and he made me feel like I am completely worthless to do intensely heartbroken need some help

Girl being emotionally invested in people that are not in you is exhausting and a terrible feeling. I know just hold on to the hope that someday you will be able to find someone that will match you. There don waist any more tears on that loser. He treated you terrible, and he sounds emotionally shallow. Take care of yourself. Give yourself some love, and you will be able to move past this and find someone better. You re still clinging on to the idea of someone that was never meant to be.

Title: First mental health visit.
Thread
I will keep this short, but basically I have been struggling for many years with anxiety and depression. Its gotten much worse lately, and I am finally ready to seek help. My question is, do I make a therapy appointment first? Or psychiatrist? I would like to get a diagnosis of what exactly is wrong with me but also want to just talk to someone. I have never done any of this, so I do not know what to expect. Thanks.
Comments
First off. I am happy you are ready to seek help. It a big step and it can be very hard to do so I am proud of you. So the major difference between psychiatrists and therapists is that psychiatrists are able to prescribe medications. Frankly, there is not a major difference beyond that, but both in my experience and what I know from psychology courses. Psychiatrists tend to focus on various treatments and prescriptions rather than one on one talk therapy, although that is also a case by case basis, sometimes they do more typical therapy sessions. I would recommend contacting therapists to test the waters I do not know your age or what accessibility you may have. But if you are in school, there is often counsellors. You can talk to that how I first reached out when I was in high school and they helped me reach out to other therapists. And my psychiatrist, same goes if you work, some workplaces offer benefits and treatments in which they have access to therapists. The first reaching out is not easy, and it can feel strange or awkward for first sessions with a therapist also do not be afraid to look elsewhere. If it is not working out for you, everyone is different. Everyone benefits from different therapies, so do not be discouraged if you have trouble connecting with someone right off the bat. I wish you luck.

Title: Is it normal to be given the crisis number?
Thread
I finallyconfusion called to make a therapist appointment to be able to get refills on medication. When you call, you have to initially do some intake questions to know exactly what help you need to best help you during this process. The woman on the call asked if I wanted the crisis line number again before hanging up. She reminded me that I could call it anytime if needed as it is available. Is this normal? My husband has called the same group if they offered. He did not say or write anything downconfusion.

I am absolutely irredeemable garbage, a total waste of space who cannot stop being a lazy piece of shit and is failing their exams for it. I am ruining my future. Hell that is, assuming I even deserve one. I am also completely socially inept, and am a brick wall to talk to there. No reason anyone would willingly spend their time with me due to how boring, unlovable and replaceable I am. I cannot take this shit anymore. I am so fucking tired of these thoughts holding me hostage all day long. I just want to end it all. Sometimes I am sorry if this seems like I am vying for attention or something, but I cannot stand the echo chamber of these thoughts that is my mind. And I just need to get this off my chest over and over again, cause I do not have any other means of getting help. Lol, assuming I deserve it, I am the reason I suffer.

Well not sure if it would make you feel better but everything is and should be replaceable no matter how good you are, you can always be replaced but it goes both ways you can also replace people and things that way you would not depend on that one thing and be free. One such thing is academic successes. Why do you believe you need it? Is it really unreplecable for you your future? Why does it matter? Moreover, why do you classify yourself as lazy? Are you sure this is not because of seth that is going on in your life. Did you see a doctor to make sure you do not have vitamin deficiency and such maybe you are not as productive as you used to be for a period of time and it is not your personality trait, no matter what, please change the way you see and talk about yourself. This is not a realistic perspective.

Severe depression is the root cause of this. Its like you are so unhappy, it makes you not care enough to do anything about your unhappiness. Even tho there is a clear and obvious path. Its a familiar vicious loop. Either rock bottom or psychiatric help. Whether it be spiritual therapy, medicationconfusion will more than likely be the only way to snap out of it, ink how open minded you are. But try some positive affirmations daily. I hear those are extremely helpful, a fake it till you make it type thing. You keep telling yourself until one day your brain believes it. Youre definitely not all those terrible things you said about yourself. Tho so stop thinking like that. You should not talk about yourself like that, despite what you think you get up every day and do what you are mentally capable of, you just need love from yourself. Most importantly, help and guidance. Talk to the pal around you about how you feel. Pal, you feel close to pal you care about, or fuck. Keep talking on reddit. Itl help a lot. Good luck. Also, I am not a doctor, but potassium magnesium tend to fix my mental state at times when I feel my lowest. Also, maybe you need stimulation. Get outside more, take walks, sit outside, just get out, helps a lot. A lot confusion.

As someone who has felt these things that you describe and has survived them, I urge you to keep going you are not the brick wall you think yourself to be. And I guarantee someone sees the human that you are and acknowledges, if not loves you for it you are brave for posting here and we all support you next time you will improve on your exams. I have failed many and still managed to get my master degree. It does not matter if it takes longer than you think it should. You got this.

I severely struggled with this mentality for years actually I am probably still going through it I always blamed myself and did nothing I lamented and just withered away especially for a certain years where I did not leave my room except for my part time so I can buy little things I had and haveconfusion, no passions or dreams. I am doing much better now but it took years of progress for me to even get here with next to support. I had to figure this shit out for myself and it is extremely difficult when there is no one to bounce your thoughts on like you said, the worst is the fucking echo chamber in my mind. I feel like I cannot think properly anymore

Just start doing something. Go for a run for a long time. You do not need to be social, have friends to be happy, you have natural talents you have not discovered. And that is ok. It easy. Try to just do something, finish a series on netflix, make your bed go for a long, a long run. Try out a new game or a read a book. Sometimes one win can motivate you to do more.

Well, there is definitely a lot to unpack here, and there is lots of things that need to happen and be addressed in order to get a holistic change number. It appears that you loath yourself. Youre also wallowing in your self pity and self doubt. Thats self sabotage. You also have learned helplessness. Probably also a hormone issue. My guess is high cortisol levels, low testosterone, your beliefs reinforce your habits and your habits reinforce your lifestyle. Start the journey of self love. If you are jacking off a lot, definitely stop and do a dopamine reset. Theres a whole nofap subreddit for that exclusively. I think this alone could do the trick the way you speak to yourself matters a whole lot. You have to come to terms with what has happened and believe that you can change that has to happen first or else nothing. Will you have to forgive yourself verbally by saying, I forgive myself for I love myself. One thing that has genuinely worked for me is repeatedly saying to myself everyday, I radiate and exude love confidence, strength, security and peace. Going to a doctor that just prescribed numbing pills is not the answer. As you are trying to uproot a giant redwood tree and not merely trim the leaves. If you walk into any social environment with an already defeated and pessimistic attitude, your actions will reinforce and strengthen your belief that you are awkward and cannot do shit right? On the contrary, if you walk into anySocial environment like you just won the lottery or you just got the best news of your life. You will attract new people and possibly new friends like energy attracts like energy, negative energy will reciprocate negative energy. Positive energy will reciprocate and attract positive energy. You are an incredible electromagnetic being, and you have a small electric field that you create. Your emotions can raise or lower that vibration. You have definitive actions you can take today. Option, continue to feel miserable and pessimistic and cry yourself into a fetal position and never leave the solace of miserable solitude or option. You adopt a new mindset of victory, and you take small steps everyday to become a better you

I want to help you without making the impression that I am one of those talking heads in a whitecoat. The mind is an incredible, precious little gem. We will never have the privilege of understanding. Its potential is far beyond what we can comprehend. And it is powerful, so much so that it can change our memories and perceptions. What we pay attention to how we adapt. There is just so much power in all of this learning and experiencing of life. Your mind is experiencing this just as you are for the first time. It is strong, which means it can be beautiful and marvelous. It can be stunning and create what was once only in our imaginations, but it can also be dark and torturous. I have always said the worst kind of torment is that of living with my own mind. I am a devout admirer of the mind because of the transformation we my mind and confusion have made in such a short time. Listen to these inner dialogues, find their sources in past experiences. How do your thoughts speak to you? Are they sometimes loud and angry? Or like a timid whisper? How do they change you? Are there themes that translate into your behaviors

I totally feel you I am failing a single subject that my future depends on. I have friends, but I am pretty sure any one of them would be able to replace me in a matter of days, even though I can get some shit done. That is literally only during my high, I say hypomania.

Real life friendsconfusion recommended me to talk to a mental health professional. I did go to my highschool psychologist, and I guess it was fine. I am not sure what I was supposed to talk with her, but I ended up threatening her with suicide. If she does not get rid of my parents. At some point in confusion, I wanted to kill them, but I decided against it because I still rely on them that suicide threat was in before wanting to kill my parentsconfusion. I had issues making friends in real life and being lonely all the time, to the point that I wanted to commit suicide times in confusion, I was not affected that much by couid, because I did not have friends in the first place. So being stuck in my house was not a new experience to meconfusion. My online friends somehow managed to talk me out of it.

I do not know how much this counts as a sexual assaultconfusion right now, I guess I am fine. I sometimes laugh at dumb things, like when a classmate makes a mistake or something along those lines, and I have lots of schoolwork. So I do not get too much time to think about myself. Even when I do not have. I will just go out of my way to learn something that I should learn later. Like graph theory in computer science. Also, I think I got the poor habit of hating any classmate that does better than me in any subject to the point that I want to ensure that I am better than that person. In all subjects, there might be some grammatical errors, because english is my second language. Also, for some reason, I am afraid to talk to that psychologist for some reason, I did not tell her anything about wanting to kill my parents or hating my classmates.

Also, for some reason, I am afraid to talk to that psychologist for some reason, I did not tell her anything about wanting to kill my parents or hating my classmates.

Title: What wrong with me? Adhd, ocd or something else? Should I seek help? Or are my current coping mechanisms enough for the long term?
Thread
Hello, all new here. Mba student, please bear with me. I plan to let it all out tonight. All these things have been there right from childhood, but I remember being happier back then and not giving a fuck. But now stakes are high ad the point before coping mechanism has been a recent occurrence. I kind of start off well, in most activities, grasping the basics quickly answering fundamental questions about the topic correctly, but fail to deep dive and sustain my interest. I categorize myself as lazy, but it really is interfering with my drive to learn. Now I do get off my ass and exercise, but this is something else I have always found. It difficult near impossible to do things I am not interested in takes me a super long time to start, and when I usually do, I tend to either miss the deadline, asking for some extension or submit a work just good enough to get me passing marks. I just cannot concentrate during online zoom classes. Thankfully, campus is reopening next week, having already missed out on about a year of learning. It causes me distress, as well as envy to see my classmates concentrate so well and contribute to the class with their videos switched on during class. Frown, sad, angry or pouting. I have obtained equivalent or better grades, though, but that took me some tricks, and a bit of reading from the book, taking away leisure time. But I scored low in marketing where I wasSupposed to submit a handwritten scanned paper, I just could not write more than pages, even though I knew the material and then messed up the page order too. While scanning in some classes, I feel the flow when I am usually blurting out the correct answers, spotting mistakes contributing to discussions more than anyone. But I get zoned out after about mins here too. I almost feel as if sometimes my mind works very quick when I can analyze stuff quickly give creative ideas, whereas during other times, it takes forever to put my brain into gear. It takes some napping, then some music, then a walk outside to feel sharp again when I am actually focused with some support from friends. When working on an interesting case, I can work on it for hours at stretch, but there is no fixed timing for when the flow hits, it just happens randomly, almost without regulation. Such as while writing this long post, I do not freak out or yell at people or lose my temper easily, generally chilled out and understanding. But some small things that do not seem to bother others as much seem to affect me more these days can cite real incidents that happened over the last months I bought this online course provided by one of our committees. We were promised video lectures access to portal for practice. It was clearly stated in the mail that access will be given on day, but it was not given. I was the onlyOne to remind them to give access week after week. Others were passive about it. I could not even sleep properly, thinking about, why are not they giving access? Similarly, recently, won a case competition the college organizing team is taking forever to issue the certificate for the win, even though a congratulatory email from the company has hit my inbox. It is a stupid administrative delay. Now, for some reason, whenever I sit for another case competition, this intrusive thought about why the delay in certificate comes in almost like I be at peace. Only when the certificate comes, I know it will come, but just cannot digest the fact that there is a delay for no apparent reason, and am unable to concentrate on anything productive without thinking about the certificate. My team mates are chilled out about it, though, and are able to carry on regular life coping mechanisms for the focus issues. I used to be able to go for a walk and come back and listen, but these days, I do not even bother to connect to audio. I either sleep or read something else or talk to a friend over the phone, etc. Some of my friends also do this for the intrusive thoughts. I just try taking deep breaths or doing something completely unrelated. It has usually been the case that the things I obsessed about happened exactly when I was not thinking about it. Thanks a lot for hearing me out. Please let me know if I shouldGo seek help. I remember being able to focus better when I used to devour enid blyton novels as a kid and read some more during undergrad too. After that, have not read a single novel.

What you are describing is almost certainly not ocd adhd can overlap with lots of other disorders and general behaviors so it would be best to consult with a professional for a thorough assessment

Title: My brain fixates on things I cannot control.
Thread
I am not sure if this is the right sub for this, but I do not know where else to post it. I have struggled a lot with this, and it is really frustrating me. I often create fantasies in my head, and then I start to expect them to happen, then get disappointed when they don a lot of time. These involve things I cannot control like a friend I have not spoken to in a while, will randomly text or call me? Obviously, I cannot control what other people do, but I can find myself fixating on things that I cannot do anything about and then get frustrated when things I imagined do not happen. I really wish I could just shut this part of my brain off, but I do not know how it makes it hard to focus on work and other things. I am trying to meditate more, and that is helpful, but it still feels like I can take the smallest things and then completely fixate on them. I just want my brain to shut the hell up once in a while.

You have to figure out what the underlining motive is. What is your desire behind control? What would you get when you could have control? Or what would you prevent?

Title: Is it normal to be given the crisis number?
Thread
I finallyconfusion called to make a therapist appointment to be able to get refills on medication. When you call, you have to initially do some intake questions to know exactly what help you need to best help you during this process. The woman on the call asked if I wanted the crisis line number again before hanging up. She reminded me that I could call it anytime if needed as it is available. Is this normal? My husband has called the same group if they offered. He did not say or write anything downconfusion.

Yes, incredibly normal to provide this as outpatient clinics are typically only open during normal business hours so these are additional resources for other times when people may be struggling

Title: First mental health visit.
Thread
I will keep this short, but basically I have been struggling for many years with anxiety and depression. Its gotten much worse lately, and I am finally ready to seek help. My question is, do I make a therapy appointment first? Or psychiatrist? I would like to get a diagnosis of what exactly is wrong with me but also want to just talk to someone. I have never done any of this, so I do not know what to expect. Thanks.

I prefer psychiatrist but I need medication to function my mental illness if you want to avoid medication you could start a psychologist

Title: Why am I never genuinely happy?
Thread
It sounds like a stupid question, but I really do not understand. My life is picture perfect. I have a job that pays the bills and allows for savings, a nice apartment, nice vehicle, a family full of love and support and great health. So I really do not understand every day is a struggle to find genuine happiness. And sometimes being energetic and happy feels so exhausting. Despite having a perfect life, I somehow hate it and am constantly desiring all the things I do not already have, and I hate that about myself. I cannot remember the last time I genuinely laughed or felt the feeling of happiness, excitement, etc. And I am hoping someone could help me to understand why
Comments
Him do you know dan bilzerian well he is that guy who won a bunch of money playing poker and now if you go look at his instagram he looks as if he lives the perfect life like I am a girl and would so want to be him anyways. One time he mentioned that no matter what girls he has or possessions he owns, he will always have this feeling that he wants more. The dude basically has everything visited so many places experienced so many things its a mind set happiness is state of being. I would ask my dad, why am I not happy whenever I was going through whatever was going on at the timeconfusion and he would ask, well, what is happiness? I did not know how to respond to that question ink, dad not being sad. He explained that happiness is dependent. Happiness is a result of something. For example, you received a raise at workyoure. Happy about it or you bought a brand new bow you have been saving up forinstant gratification. What happens when the newness of those circumstances wear off? What are you left with joy? My dad later described joy is the good shit. It is consistent and is not dependent on outside forces or circumstances joy is independent. Joy is inward peace and contentmentbeing. Content with what is I hope that this helps you, as for it did me hearing the differences puts life into perspective. It takes practice. Operating your life with joy. SocialMedia can be a thief and steal that away from you. Put it down for a bit. If you have it and see what it does for you, social media can put off a false image of life. Even then joy still takes practice. For me, I try to do something different every week, what my therapist recommended for me to finding joyconfusion, and it is worked so far. For my first week, I got a tattoo on my leg of my birth year that I have been wanting for a while. It brought happiness, but I found joy in meeting someone new. The guy who did my tattooconfusion and just the over all experience. Lik how it goes

It been a year. I met someone long distance, where he and I talked almost everyday for five months but could not meet due to the pandemic. I stopped talking to him once I found out he was seeing someone in his city. They started a relationship, and it did not work out. And he messaged me again. Months later, I missed him everyday for those months and thought he came back because he missed me to. He told me, even though he was back, he was going to see other people. And let me know when he got into a relationship. I knew I could not handle my feelings for him and what he was doing. So I distanced myself. He continued to call amp text, but I kept putting off meeting him in person, as I figured he would meet someone in his city and forget about me. He probably was seeing someone in his city, but continued to insist on seeing me. He asked me when I was free, and he just bought a ticket and flew from texas to come see me in ny. This was a year after we started talkingconfusion. I kept my distance when he got here, but he kept pushing to drink with me, and we fooled around while I was drunk, did not have sexconfusion. The next day, he told me he did not want a relationship, flew back to texas and advertised a date, on his stories.

I have recently shared my feelings with a few of my friends and they validated me, and it felt great.

Title: Why do I feel guilty?
Thread
On saturday, my now ex partner and I broke up. Both of out mental health was just not good enough that we were starting to not be happy together. It was more of a mutual break up. Then one of us breaking up with the other. They explained that it was not just one of our faults, that it is a combination of both of us. I still feel guilty, though I still very much love them, and I want to get better and be with them again. I reached out to the trevor project for some help. The counselor I talked, too, said that I was caring and loving of other people, but not of myself. That sadly true. I care about pretty much anyone I have a connection with, but I do not give a shit about myself. Every time I have a small moment of happiness, I feel guilty that my now ex partner is not happy, but I see them on their instagram story, that they are getting better and I still feel guilty, cause now I am the one not happy, and they are. I really do not know what I need to do to help myself here. I have thought about voluntarily checking into a psychiatric hospital, cause I have been, have a lot of intrusive thoughts about hurting myself. At this point. I do not really want to kill myself, but I would be fine dying. I have been feeling emotionally numb the past few days. I want toGet better, not just for my now ex partner or anyone else, but for myself. I really want to get better, but I just do not know what I should be doing. I feel like I have been doing all the right things, but I still get punished like I am doing not the right things. This is a genuine call out for help, please. I want to get better.

Title: Is this serious?
Thread
I find that a significant portion of my waking life in the past few months has been specifically thinking about fire, how it spreads what incandescence is. But I also find that over my life, I have had a series of encounters with fire that were not beneficial to my mental health. I have over my life seen mishandling of fire and the burning of a house in my childhood, and I think because of this, I now have almost a need to set fire to something if I can. It is this weird compulsion that drove me to set relatively small but still concerning fires all throughout my life, I think in total, the amount of small fires I have set in this. I am going to call it manic, because that is the best way I can describe it state is around. I know that seems like alot, but it really is not considering the amount of time I have had these compulsions, and over time, they have been getting bigger and bigger. These fires, it started out with match or watching a lighter burn. It is flame, and now it is entire paper towel rolls and boxes of matches and other things. And I have looked it up, and it caused concern in me. I do not think I have pyearomania, but google will not tell me otherwise. Is this problem something that I should take seriously? I have not told anyone about anything I have said so far. Should I tell myMom.
Comments
Yeah, no matter what, you should take this post to your mom and let her read it. I am no doctor, but maybe something like an ocd drug would help you either. Way, she needs to make sure you get the medical attention you need before you lose control. As most people with an ocd problem, eventually, doconfusion go ahead, talk to her now and let us know how it went. Ocd never gets better on its own. It gets worse, but it is usually fairly easy to treat and get under control.

Title: Views on medication and when to start taking.
Thread
I need to talk to someone who has experience of taking medication, but not sure if this is the right place for me to share this. I have been dealing with depression, loneliness and anxiety since I remember, and I am losing hope it ever gets better. I have been in therapy for the last two years, and I have made a lot of changes in my life and am fairly successful for my age. But the hopeless feelings never go away. Since there has been so little progress. I have been considering medication, and I actually got it prescribed months ago, but I never started taking it, because I am afraid of it, and I have strong views on it, which people here maybe will not like. I do not knowconfusion. I dislike medications in general, because I am quite conscious of what I put in my body and how it may affect my body. I used to be a professional athlete, and it used to be very strict in terms of what you put in your body, whether as food painkillers or drinks, etc. So I guess it comes from that. I also heavily disagree how the west treats mental health and how the current society is designed. It is so far from being natural and reasonable. So we have got pills to make us numb enough to keep going through this meaningless lives, where we have to work week and pay, always increasing bills and deal with ever present misery. So the wheelsKeep turning. I never wanted to become part of it and supporting the system by taking medication to keep me going with this. And so I have been doing all possible to avoid that lately. I have been thinking that we rather regret of what we did not do than of what we did, and that maybe I should give the medication try, but I am so scared of it is against all my beliefs, and I have so much anxiety around it too. What if it will not work? What if I end up in this never ending cycle of searching for the right type? What if I never get off it? What if it fucks up my body and I will never get my health back? What if I put up a lot of weight? How will I deal with the feeling that I failed it? So many things involved that I do not know if trying it is even worthy. But honestly, I am tired, and I just want to get better

The experts agree that sis are mainly for severe cases of depression. Although they disagree about where to draw the line between severe and moderate, it important to consider non drug treatments that work physically on the system videoconfusion. Most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy, cbtconfusion than with medicine, and some are successful with self help. Based on cut, I can show you some cut self help. But first, I want to say that recently, there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing advice from experts about mood disorders. In my comments, please click and read.

What medication.

Title: Views on medication and when to start taking.
Thread
I need to talk to someone who has experience of taking medication, but not sure if this is the right place for me to share this. I have been dealing with depression, loneliness and anxiety since I remember, and I am losing hope it ever gets better. I have been in therapy for the last two years, and I have made a lot of changes in my life and am fairly successful for my age. But the hopeless feelings never go away. Since there has been so little progress. I have been considering medication, and I actually got it prescribed months ago, but I never started taking it, because I am afraid of it, and I have strong views on it, which people here maybe will not like.

Title: I need help.
Thread
My brain has always seemed to go very fast. So over the years, I found medications to slow me down first. It started with benadryl, because it would make me drowsy, but because of me being so hyperactive, the sedating effect helped me be more productive during the day, I would take a few a day. Then it became a day. So I had to find other ways to calm me down. Examples of a few throughout the years are kratom melatonin, muscle relaxants, alcohol and benzodiazepines. Now, I am at a point where I take all of those substances every single day. I finally decided to go see a doctor. When my grandpa recently died and I became suicidal. I checked myself into a mental facility rehab. It was great at the beginning. But then things only spiraled downwards. After the first week, they finally chalked it up to ocd, severe anxiety and schizophrenia. They then put me on prozac and olanzapine. Two weeks go by, and I started feeling more irritable, anxious, fidgety out of touch, with reality, zoning out constantly, etc. And I also started to get very bad tremors. To the point, I had to get my parents to poor me my drinks, like milk out of the jug. Once my next medication appointment came around, I told them these problems, so they said that it was probably just negative side effects. So they decided to change my meds to risperdal and lexapro. I do not know if it is just myAnxiety exacerbating my symptoms. But ever since a few days of starting these new medications, I have become so fidgety and restless it has almost driven me to complete insanity. Everything that seemed fun to me in the near past has now become boring and feels like a chore, like I used to love playing video games, watching youtube, netflix and working on electronics. Now I cant sit down and do stuff I used to love doing without taking copious amounts of xanax, benadryl and muscle relaxants. I do not feel like I am delusional, but I guess that is what a person that is delusional would say lao. But I genuinely do not feel like the answer to my problem I am facing is addiction, because my definition of copious amounts of xanax is like my, which is quite a bit for me. I do not know where I am going with this paragraph, but all I am asking for is someones outside opinion on what is going on. In my opinion, its that I have adhd and antipsychotics decrease dopamine in the receptor and increase dopamine in the prefrontal cortex, pretty much does the exact opposite of what adhd medications do. So I am assuming that these medications I am taking are making my adhd worse by decreasing my dopamine in my brain, which is what people with adhd lack in their brains. So now I am suffering from parkinsonism induced by my medication because I already lacked dopamine in the first place. IfYou are going to respond to this. Please be as transparent as possible. Thank you.

How much time has passed since you were taking all those medications a day and the time they put you on prozac and olanzapine were they aware how much you were taking or how often you were taking it before they gave you the prozac?

Title: Question about involuntary commitment.
Thread
Hello all first. This account is a throwaway. I have a person in my life who is in desperate need of help. She is critically depressed, not eating, drinking all day. Every day has an untreated seizure disorder diagnosed by her doctor, but she does not take her medicationconfusion. She has a history of meth use. I am in the process of trying to have her involuntarily committed. This is not ideal or what I wanted, but she is in denial and will not seek help. She has ended up in the hospital several times over the last year and ended up there again monday, after no sleep, no eating and throwing up for days straight. This was also a period of no contact from her, and had she not advised that she went to the hospital. I was about to call a wellness check. I have no experience with this process. However, my friend is known to lie and manipulate to get out of whatever she may be in. She is also vocally against hospitalization or rehab. What I want to know is how thorough is the process of commitment will she be able to lie her way out? Will the doctors be able to identify her declining health?

Title: I constantly feel betrayed by friends.

I have a few friends that I have a really great contact with, but for some reason, I always feel bad when I hear that they are hanging out with their other friends. For some reason, I often think that they prefer other people over me. I know it is normal for people to have many friends and honestly do not know why I feel like that.
Comments
This sounds super unhealthy, proper should not prefer you over everyone else, and it makes sense for them to hang out without you. Do you hang out with all your friends every time you see a friend, think of someone you love, and consider how frequently they are included. When you decide you would like to see a friend. What does that say about how you feel about them repeat the activity with other people you love? What does it say about them? Probably nothing relevant, which is my point.

I am surprised this did not get more attention laughing out loud. I feel the same way I have a few good online friends that all know eachother. Irl I always feel left out because they always get to hang out and do stuff together. And I often feel like I am not a real friend for me, I feel like one of the big reasons is since I have such little friends like confusion. Irl when I hear that they are hanging out with eachother it other people, I feel left out even though it was not, their intention just reach out more. I promise they would love to hang out. Keith you more sometimes you just got to make the first move

Title: Anybody able to help with an odd symptom.
Thread
I confusion. So I had braces from afterwards I was given plastic mould retainers to wear nightly, which I did until toward the end of that time, I noticed how much I was clenching my teeth down into the retainers to make them fit better. The problem was that doing that gave me a big response of pleasure and pain, and it became a compulsive habit, despite not wearing the retainers for years now. And despite not really grinding my teeth, as far as I am aware, I still have this compulsion, all I have to do is think about it, and I get that pleasure pain feeling it very irritating and has taken away a large portion of my general well, being and enjoyment of the past few years. I believe it even has led to sexual function problems. As it allocates a lot of my energy into the wrong place, I can even feel my gums throb. Oftentimesconfusion, does anyone have any idea how I might go about getting my mind out of this feeling?

I am not saying that this is necessarily all you need. Maybe your problem is complicated, but panic disorder is very treatable, and overcoming this will make you feel better. I have advice from experts about anxiety and other problems in my comments, and you are welcome to click on my name and read. I will tell you what I know about panic disorder often responds to self help. In fact, handbook of self help therapies, which reviews studies of books and programs, says that of all the disorders, panic disorder is the one that is most responsive to self help. I heard someone say that although slow breathing is good for moments of panic, the attacks keep coming back, so it looks like cognitive therapy is also helpful. Cognitive therapy for panic disorder involves understanding what the attack is. The symptoms are nothing but your system, natural responses to whatever seems threatening. You should not get upset about them. You do not worry about fast heartbeat when you run, and there is no reason to fear it. With a panic attack source when panic attacks by do david burns, you cannot go wrong with stress management it something we all need. This could help you with your problem psychology today online says that do dave carbonell is a clinical psychologist who specializes in treating fears and phobias. And the author of three self help books, including panic attacks, workbook in this video, do carbonell demonstrates a breathing exercise that he says is helpful for panic.Attacks. One of the best treatments is time you know the old saying, familiarity breeds contempt after a while the attacks are seen as a nuisance instead of a threat. I will tell you about two other things that you probably will not need. Its good to know they are there if you need them. A study by a researcher named meuret at southern methodist university showed that a biofeedback method called cart that reinforces slow, shallow breathing was effective. Slow breathing is often recommended, but deep breathing tends to promote hyperventilation making it hard for people to breathe. Many people use slow breathing self help successfully. There. A treatment called interoceptive exposure therapy. It teaching people not to fear the symptoms of the panic attack by deliberately bringing on the symptoms, for example, by bringing on a fast heartbeat by aerobic exercise.

Title: I really do not know.

Before I start sorry for my bad english and the explaining after I not that good to express myself for the past years I have been stressed out and have not been able to sleep probably after there is to many things in my head and I somehow got this fear to be around people I feel uncomfortable around people even my familie even if they have not done anything one of the many things is the feeling of emptiness and the feeling that I do not care about anything I have lost all I have lost all motivation to do things and lost hope I do not see a future where I can place myself in I can only see the past where I only see things I regret like things I have said and have done it like not bad things or stupid things in that way but still they somehow hurt a lot for a small time even if I try not to think about it just pop up out of no where I somehow get the feeling I punish myself but I have no idea why it happens every night and it makes me want to hurt myself and to end myself but I never want to do so after there is still a thing I enjoy in life and that helps my mind to relax and it is drinking tea but I cannot do that forever. One of the other things there has been really hard for me lately has beenLearning and doing stuff. I got a diagnose call asperger. So things is really hard to learn, but I still do my best and always have done of what I can do. Cuz I do not want to give something that I have not done my best on. I maybe a little perfectionist. But even when I do my best and give it all and spend all my energy on the things I get told that I looks like, I do not want to do the things, and I lazy, and I should do better than this. And that is one of the reason why have lost all hope for myself. Even my best looks like nothing. What hope could there be for someone like me? Then someone who needs help with everything. A person there needs a push before they can start on the things. A person who needs thing at the time, before they are able to do things who wants someone like that? Someone like me. If I should explain things about myself, the only words there comes to mind is useless, worthless, lazy, unloving and completely hopeless person.

Title: Is something wrong with me?
Thread
Sorry to make another post about my mom death. This should be the last one, as you can see, if you look at my account. My mom passed away yesterday. Now, this is not the first time I have lost a loved one. It happened two other times, one when I was and another when I was. Those two deaths really hit me hard and put a halt my development. However, my mom death has not been affecting me as much. I do not know if it is the fact I have dealt with grief before or if I still have not processed what is happened, but I have not been feeling how I thought I would. It, like, all the big emotions came the day of her death, and now I am fine. I still miss her and are upset about her death, but it has not been very life changing. Is there something wrong with me? I know it may be too early to tell how this is going to affect me, but I figured I would ask this in case it could be sign of something else.

Delayed grief is common. I got smacked all at once like, years later about deaths. I was living in a fantasy bubble because of how it all happened. I had no way of processing that when it occurred over the course of a few years, you might be numb now, but do not think your out of the woods yet try to establish a support system while you are still feeling decent.

Just speculating. I recently lost a close friend and a little while before I grieved after my cat died. Both happened tragically, not comparing, but both times it took over a month for the funk to set in. It was hard but not isolating and forcing myself to do social things or just a routine to get outside the house daily helped me with my funk. Im so sorry for your loss. Feel free to reach out and message anytime you might need.

Title: I am genuinely not sure on what to do with my life.

Yoconfusion hey, there I am genuinely stuck on what I want to do with my life.

Title: What will finally make me stop crying?
Thread
It been a year. I met someone long distance, where he and I talked almost everyday for five months but could not meet due to the pandemic. I stopped talking to him once I found out he was seeing someone in his city. They started a relationship, and it did not work out. And he messaged me again. Months later, I missed him everyday for those months and thought he came back because he missed me to. He told me, even though he was back, he was going to see other people. And let me know when he got into a relationship. I knew I could not handle my feelings for him and what he was doing. So I distanced myself. He continued to call amp text, but I kept putting off meeting him in person, as I figured he would meet someone in his city and forget about me. He probably was seeing someone in his city, but continued to insist on seeing me. He asked me when I was free, and he just bought a ticket and flew from texas to come see me in ny. This was a year after we started talkingconfusion. I kept my distance when he got here, but he kept pushing to drink with me, and we fooled around while I was drunk, did not have sexconfusion. The next day, he told me he did not want a relationship, flew back to texas and advertised a date, on his stories.

Is this person life more important than yours is this person more important to you than you does your life depend on theirs. Do they cry when you cry, you are you? Your loyalty is always to you. First, there are so many great people in the world, so many unique and interesting connections to be made, and you will make them the rest of your life. It easy to get so invested in someone that you feel they are your whole world that you exist together. Remember, you are two different people. They are them and you are. You do not depend on them. You exist with or without them take care of yourself. Much love,

This kind of sounds like a self fulfilling prophecy. Your admitting that you are an awful person thats heading nowhere. But why? What is it about you that you think is awful? Do you really believe that? Or are you just internalizing what other people have told you and therefore becoming that?

Title: Do I need therapy before hoping for one love?
Thread
I am another guy that has been through a lot without a father figure with certain deficiencies and complexes. And recently I started talking with a girl. One thing she mentioned is that even tho she is, she is, does not trust any individual below, because most of them are immature and without a proper vision. Because of my childhood and previous failed relationship attempts, I supressed most of my emotions and gave up on investing time, trying to talk to girls and focused on intellectual and business growth. But emotionally, I am a crippled kid. We talked for a few days, and she needed some empathy, and I foolishly tried to find solutions instead of actively listening. Nevertheless, I are not ready for commitment nor proper communication in a relationship. What are your insights suggestions? Thank you. In advance

I confusion genuinely cannot understand how and why I get so attached so easily. For example, I have been living alone, but then not even weeks ago I got a roommate whom I have never met beforeconfusion tomorrow. She is living. And when she told me that I started panicking and feeling sad about it, I did not even like living with her and I do not even necessary like her. She nice but you know what I meanconfusion either way, the fact that she is leaving makes me feel like shit like I was doing fine. And then she told me that, and you started feeling like shit in general and ended up questioning everything and having suicidal thoughts. Maybe the too arent related or maybe the one triggered the other, or like, year ago, I went with my mom on vacation after a few days her of joined us, and he ended up leaving earlier than us. The thought of him leaving made me again so sad, and it is not that I enjoy being with him so fucking much that him leaving makes me feel this way in general, the thought of suitcases or people leaving myself includedconfusion makes me feel uneasy and just upset. In general. I am so tired of feeling shitty all the time. I wake up feeling anxious. I keep overthinking. I feel like I am living for my family and not myself. I do not even know myself. I genuinely don at least times a week. I getThis depressed mood and it is so bad sorry for the rant I am just so alone right now.

My mother needs housing. She is she is mentally ill and receives disability because of her illness, bipolar schizophrenicconfusion.

She lived with my grandmother until then, I moved her into the group home in it was supposed to be temporary, and its time for me to find her somewhere alone. She can take care of herself, but she needs assistance, shopping, paying bills, errands. I live in the nashville to area. I have signed up for two different waitlist for different low income apartments. She receives disability every month, and that will pay for her rent. She is currently on a waitlist, but I want to make sure she has someone to come, give her medicine and take care of small things. I am looking for any information on housing or social services. I am just a little lost, trying to find long term care. Thank you. Whoever reads this
Comments
Is she on medicaid? I would start there and see if she qualifies for any home aid type care services. I would also try to connect with your local, state county services. A social worker would be your best bet to see if there are other resources to support independent living. Unfortunately, for long term care, your options are likely limited to independent living with family group homes and assisted living nursing homes. Some areas may have day treatment type programs for individuals with serious mental illness like your mom that can provide some therapeutic services. Some structure and regular observation by mental health professionals. Good luck.

Been struggling, isolating and not living outside my comfort zone. After a close friend passed away tragically, a couple months ago, isolating was my main killer. Im years free from alcohol, heavy drugs and cigs. As of yesterday, I made a plan to do a meetings days a week again, to get out of the apartment and starting church once again on sundays days into exciting. This plan has broken the ice on this funk. The funk even had me slip up for awhile on smoking pot. I put the cork back on that and am now days free and clean. Thanks for the post, ive been getting well again, but my brain runs like wild squirts at night. Talking about it does help

To state has, is and pod programs in counseling. Some schools operate training clinics where their grad students provide evidence based therapies, like cut under supervision of licensed faculty. Typically, the costs are quite low per session, depending on incomeconfusion. You can see if any other schools around nashville might have similar setups.

I have been a therapist on better help. It is usually for therapist just wanting to supplement their income. I would look into a local community mental health company in your town and see if they have reduced rates, pro bono cases, or if they have free funding to have your sessions paid for. There is help out there. But it takes some digging. You may also want to call social services because they would know who offers reduced rates as well. Good luck.

I have had a pretty mixed experience with betterhelp. One of their therapist was absolute garbage and made things worse for me, but I complained about it, and they found me someone better. Having in person therapy in your area is probably better still, but if you really cannot afford it, betterhelp is a good start.

I would start with your pop. The majority of common psychiatric meds, like antidepressants for depression and anxiety, are managed by pops. They will know to refer out if they believe your case is more complex. I would start by cataloging what your primary symptoms are, so you can be really clear and effective on communicating whether its your pop or a psychiatrist. Good luck.

Title: Adhd wasting my life.
Thread
Whoever reading this thanks for the few minutes you take to spare, reading this, looking for any help guidance I can get my story. Growing up, I was an a student besides maybe talking too much in class and being bullied on and off. Typical social anxiety trouble. Fitting in stuffconfusion. My parents did not believe I was adhd per se, as I did not show many symptoms by puberty, my parents and I began butting heads. I was far too diplomatic and logical for my age. Which one can imagine is difficult to parentconfusion. So they took me to a specialist. I was told I was doing an iq test. He diagnosed me with adhd at fast forward to high school. Around age, my grades started dropping off. I became generally avoidant of schoolwork and school in general and lost most interest in it. I acted up in several other minor aspects of my life went through the typical period of obsession with the opposite sex, and began to seemingly disappoint my parents. They started to believe this was due to the adhd and informed me of my diagnosis. I was prescribed my vyvanse, which in retrospect, was far too muchconfusion combined with my sri, previously diagnosed with depression, still on lexapro. To this dayconfusion, I already had been prescribed for. I got my things done, but not much else. Besides that, I still felt like a shadow of the person I was when I was performing better academically before my adhd seemed to appearIn college, I drank too much way too much and it became a sleeping crutch after a few years replaced that crutch with cannabis, which is the only relief I seemed to find for my symptoms to quiet my head at night. Im an insomniac of sortsthoughts keep randomly shooting off like fireworks in my brain when I am trying to sleepconfusion, long story short for now, cannabis is what is keeping me sane in law school to look forward to at the end of the day to quiet down my brain. I am now on adzenys or out. My I meditate a bit I try to exercise when I can and I have good intentions about my health, but for the life of me, I cannot seem to start a routine. I am going to hopefully become a lawyer soon, and I need some sort of help on new medications techniques, therapies to seek out, because I have this horrible feeling like I am watching my life pass, watching through a window. Every doctor tries tossing me on another med higher, lower my vyvanse and higher my adzenys are all I have triedconfusion and does not seem genuinely concerned about my case. Personally, as adhd is different for everyone, I now waste almost all of my days, and all of my free time, my brain, when not in task positive mode or with nothing incredibly pressing at hand, goes completely default and immediately looks for dopamine to cannabis sweets, etc. Confusion. This results in tiktokScrolling endlessly deleting the app, getting bored enough and being impulsive enough to re download it using cannabis, just because it makes being bored and in default mode, more enjoyable when it comes time to perform in life, I almost always perform still usually just enoughconfusion, but do so through a procrastination induced panic. How do I try to actually escape this loop? I am tired of living like this.

Title: Why do psych wards do not allow to keep your phone open discussionconfusion
Thread
I live in the us, and every time that I went to a psych ward or residential for my eating disorder, I was not allowed to keep my phone, I really do not understand why. And it can be frustrating, because then I have no way to talk with my friends or distract myself. I guess it is for privacy and focusing only on recovery without distractions. Instead, I know that in the uk and italy let you keep your phone with no problems. So confusion.
Comments
I work at a psychiatric hospital. Its because you are with other people all day, and it is for their privacy. They cannot prevent you from taking photos of other people and sharing it. So the only thing they can do to prevent that is taking the phone away. If your phone did not have a camera, you would be allowed to keep it.

Title: I am so frustrated I want to make a best friend but I struggle too much with social anxiety and worry.
Thread
I will not lie. I get a tinge jealous when I see people with best friends. I do not have one besides my so, but I am not counting him because I am talking strictly friendconfusion, and I have lost almost all my childhood friends that I once called my best friends. One went crazy, religious and started being hateful. The other two just stopped talking to me for no reason. And the fourth only wants to talk about herself and her issues. I so badly want a best friend that I can have deep conversations with and rave about whatever I am hooked on besides my. So I hate bothering him too muchconfusion, but I have no one. I want to try to make friends. But talking to people is physically painful, and I feel like my mental issues make it impossible to make friends I have tried before, but I just cannot connect with anyone. And the people I met eventually showed some colors. I did not like I am just so tired of trying after being screwed over so much does anyone else relate?

Days is no small feat. My friend. But it also means that your brain will start telling you things like, I good. Now, I do not need to keep structure in my life, and I do not have a problem like I thought, I can relax. Don listen to the justifications and rationalizations keep doing the daily things you know, you need to do in order to stay sober. I have been sober years, and the battle never ends. Does it get easier? Of course, but I always need to stay aware of where I am at mentally and vigilant every day. For me, prayer, meditation, reading spiritual and inspired words and exercising everyday are key for me. Not once in years. Have I gone without my spiritual practices? And that is what it takes to have the peace of sobriety. What are your things that keep you grounded, that keep you growing spiritually and mentally? I always keep in mind that if I am not progressing, then I am digressing, I really cannot maintain. If I think I am doing that, then I am probably digressing. Hold on to those daily things you need to do and do not let anything or anyone get in the way of them also find at least person in your life that you can lean on and trust to be a support. In the hard times, even after years of sobriety, I face crises where I need to go to someone and tell them I am not okay. AndI really need them to watch me and be here. It is a burden on them, yes, but it is better than turning into the beast again, right? You can do this. Stay connected to your higher power and keep moving forward, even if you are only crawling. Sometimes take it one day at a time. I am rooting for you my friend.

To the author and everyone I wanted to say that it not about days it is about how strong you decide to be better and forget about it and it cannot be defined it day thought like you have to be times confident and times doubting if you are firm about your decision so you literally have to win times until you know exactly what you are and what you want it can be done in days and in days all up you to decide whether you it will take or days be firm and strong and once you realize you want to escape it do not fin hesitate if you start doubting on a red or the day cuz you will but if you know for sure what you want then you just simply do not give a about your doubts the longer you stay in this way the further you go in this direction and the firmer you become and the more you realize what you actually want and why you are even doing it ask yourself what sacrifice you ate ready to make in order to make it done it will show you how badly you want to kill it peace

I have done the exact same thing with my cptsd and stop researching. I felt way worse and regret digging deeper. It made me think, how traumatic my middleschool years truly was and how one family member treated and spoke to me when I was younger. There is nothing wrong with researching to understand your illness, but dont overthink it. That was my mistake.

Title: Hello.
Thread
Hello. When we feel bad, it feels like it will last forever. Encouraging words do not matter. We are worthless, there is no motivation, no incentive to do anything. There is darkness and everything is tinted in a dark hue. Why care? Why read, write, play games or be sociable? Why should I do anything at all? What we need is time will change our disposition. Time changes our consciousness and opens up for new possibilities. What is now is not what will be everything is changing all the time. The illusion is that it does not because it truly does change. We all know this. It will. It always does. It just does not feel that way. A day may seem like an eternity. A month may seem like a lifetime in hell. I know what it feels like, but please do not give in to the illusion that it is permanent because it is not. I am in a good place right now, and thus realize this. And I want to encourage you who are in a dark place to hold on and ride it through. I salute all other conscious beings, and I wish you nothing but love and happiness

Title: How do I know if I have a mental illness or get screened for an unknown mental illness?
Thread
I feel like I am going insane, but I feel like there is something wrong with me. I think I had depression before, cause in the past, I would not take showers. I would have a hard time getting out of bed. There are more. I dont feel like namingconfusion, but I have gotten a little better since then, but still. And my friend today suggested that I might have anxiety because would not stop asking if he was mad at me. But he remembers the questions when he got screened, and he said, I possibly would end up checking yes for most of them. And there are other things, too, but anyways, I need something to tell me what I have. I do not want to keep self diagnosing myself and then brushing it off. Everything feels like I am faking it, but I dont think I am then thinking, I definitely am faking it. Then I end up questioning everything. Can someone please help

Best thing would be to talk to a medical professional. You can start with your primary care provider as many become the first point of contact prior to getting referred to mental health specialists. Good luck.

Title: My usually depressed husband has been very up the last few weeks. I would love some insight.
Thread
Hi. I figured I would have more luck posting this. Here is a doctor subreddit. My husband has always been more on the down, depressed side. He is an amazing person, but has definitely had quite a few low periods in his life. He smoked weed oils for about years and started lexapro when he quit about a year ago. He quit the lexapro after about months because he felt good and recently went back on when he realized the lexapro was helping more than he thought. Fast forward to. Now. We just had our fourth child, and he just started back to work after paternity leave. I noticed, right before he went back, he started seeking out any and every friend online, needing to chat. It seemed like he did not care what he was talking about. He just wanted constant interaction. He has started posting on facebook constantly. Like, every thought he has seems to be important enough to post, he has basically been going a million miles an hour and keeps saying he feels great and feels so happy. He seems to always be talking and needing validation on every thought he has. He is helping out with more household duties than ever before and has a lot more energy. I know I should be happy about this, but something just does not feel right. He finally looked at me tonight and said, he thinks it is abnormal at how good he feels. And I felt a little relief that he recognized this.I do not want him to go back to being depressed but his behavior has been a little unpredictable his theory is that maybe the lexapro was helping him the most when he was quitting weed and oils but maybe now his dopamine levels have risen again and the meds are working too well I think maybe he is going into a slight manic episode but I do not know we are going to call the doctor when monday rolls around but I am hoping someone will see this post and give us a little insight his mom does have bipolar but my husband has never been diagnosed with this disorder he is. Could it show up this late if he has masked with weed and alcohol most of his adult life? Thank you to anyone that has read this far I love my husband so much and am just concerned

Title: In what ways does trauma have to be handled differently compared to other issues? In order to see progress, I am stuck trying to fix how I am feeling but to no avail.
Thread
In late november, I experienced something that immediately put me into a depressive episode. I rarely get them, but they are insanely hard to get out of where I am unhappy. All of the time can barely tolerate existing day to day, stop enjoying things I previous did lose almost all ability to be productive, etc. I am sure you know exactly what I mean. My mental health professionals have agreed that I am exhibiting textbook trauma reactions, feelings to the particular experience, and are approaching recovery from that perspective. Now, I am someone who really values self analysis, reflection and figuring out ways to improve. I absolutely fucking hate this state I am in. So I am doing. All the things I know are meant to help heal oneself things like not ignoring my feelings, accepting them, finding distractions that make me happy, talking to trusted individuals about what is been going on and keeping distance from what caused the bad eventconfusion. However, apparently, trying to speedrun recovery does not necessarily work, let alone with trauma. I am not savvy with. How it needs to be dealt with. Seems like it is a lot more sensitive of a process that goes beyond the typical ways one would improve their mental health state, nor is it linear. Unfortunatelyconfusion, I do not know, but any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. As I have been stuck like this for almost months, and I need to become an actual person again, rather than a useless corpse that criesFor no reason I just want to get better, but I clearly do not know the way to do it with trauma, feeling pretty desperate for a solution or at least to be shown a helpful path to go down. Thank you any. And all comments are encouraged.

Title: I feel so dirty.
Thread
This is a rant. I have not showered in almost two weeks. I rlly want to shower. I want to so bad, but I cant. It seems to always slip my mind, and I just want to feel clean. This has been happening for a few months now, where il shower once a week and say, ok, il shower every two days. Then next thing I know a week or two has passed once that week passes. All I can think of is how long il be in the shower trying to scrub the dirt of my body, my hairs? Even worst I wash it if you can even call it rhatconfusion every few weeks to a month. And as someone with high maintenance, curly, dyed hair, that is rlly bad for my hair, my room stays dirty. No matter how many times I clean it, I just feel so dirty. When I am in the shower, it feels like no matter how hard I scrub, I can never feel clean, and it is such a frustrating feeling. Il keep scrubbing, but I just cannot feel clean, I feel like I might have so form of depression. But whenever I think that I just feel like I sound like a self diagnosing who is not taking the mental illness serious
Comments
I really struggled to shower, switched to baths, not saying that is the solution. But maybe there is another option or path here. What part of getting in the shower is hard for you and are there ways to trick yourself around that? My friends call it setting traps. So basically you have no choice but to shower. Eventually, it becomes a habit. I hope you know, this is a very common symptom of depression, self neglect. A lot of us have been here many times. Its awful, and I am sorry you are going through it. Now, I also started buying bath bombs all the time, because they delight me. So even when I was too depressed to care about showering or bathing, I would want to do the bath bomb and enjoy the fizzing and fragrance. So it became not a chore, but a more luxurious and fun thing.

This has been happening for a few months now, where il shower once a week and say, ok, il shower every two days. Then next thing I know a week or two has passed once that week passes. All I can think of is how long il be in the shower trying to scrub the dirt of my body, my hairs? Even worst I wash it if you can even call it rhatconfusion every few weeks to a month. And as someone with high maintenance, curly, dyed hair, that is rlly bad for my hair, my room stays dirty. No matter how many times I clean it, I just feel so dirty. When I am in the shower, it feels like no matter how hard I scrub, I can never feel clean, and it is such a frustrating feeling. Il keep scrubbing, but I just cannot feel clean, I feel like I might have so form of depression. But whenever I think that I just feel like I sound like a self diagnosing who is not taking the mental illness serious

Title: Why is self harm bad?
Thread
For quite some time I have been wondering if self harming is really such a bad thing. I have been self harming for about years now, and it really does not seem like such a big issue to me. I am aware of the fact that self harming is not good, and people should not do it, but at the and of the day, your just hurting yoursel. And most of the time, with no long term damage, I am generally just curious what is other people opinion on this topic? And I want to understand what make is so bad? Maybe there is something that I am just not seeing, because at this point it has become such a norm for me

Its a symptom of trauma that needs to be resolved, in my opinion.

I am with you mid self harmed by cutting off and on more off than onconfusion from age I never went near a major blood vessel main spot ended up being my outer hip area over time my tool changed from blade to safety pin and thumb tack due to the increased precision never bled to a point of concern never sought any treatment for the wound nor needed to main issue is that if I went to the pool or the beach and wanted to swim, I loathe swimmingconfusion I would wear swim shorts I actually bought a pair just for this reason but have not yet worn them to both me and my therapist the concern is not the self harming it is the reason for self harming I self harm due to an overwhelming self hate and shame that bubbles up my main trigger is making stupid mistakes I should have avoided. No one should be emotionally reacting to such mistakes in the way I do it is not healthy for anyone to hate themselves this much. These are the things my therapy is addressing. I have not cut in over a year, but that is not the point for either me or my therapist. If I never cut again but still felt that way about myself, neither of us would consider this a success op. I think that a lot of people like to imagine that once the cutting stops so do the shame and self hatred that drive it easier forThem to think that and it is far easier to get someone to stop cutting than to cure their deepest psychic wounds this is a huge part of why you see so much focus on stopping the self harm yes, there is the danger aspect, but you will notice that if you tell people you are self harming in a way with no potential for serious harm many of them brush that aside and still insist you should quit essentially if you would just pretend that the shame and self hatred do not exist and act in more socially acceptable ways that would be great

This is very interesting. I guess harming oneself is not bad, per se. The problem, as I see, it, is that it is a sign of mental disorder. There is, as I see, it, no good reason to harm oneself. Why do you harm yourself?

Most people self harm to cope with something difficult that they are experiencing, resolving what that core difficulty is, or at least how it negatively impacts each individualconfusion would be an amazing goal and self harming, even if no long term damage is being done, might be a barrier towards accomplishing that goal. And of course, sometimes non suicidal self harm can get out of hand and permanent damage or even death can accidentally occur.

I think it has a lot more to do with the psychological damage you probably are not even fully conscious of causing when you intentionally hurt yourself, even if you are not fully aware of. It has to register somewhere that condoning these actions mean you are okay with harm coming to your body. How can you feel safe if you know you are not going to protect yourself from harm? Would you ever hurt another person the way you hurt yourself? I self harmed just a few times as a teenager, but had already found way more effective ways of destroying my life than through cutting or burning. Once, when I was drunk, I asked a friend to burn me with their cigarette, and they were horrified. I remember them saying, I could never do that to you. It is stuck with me since then that at the time I had about, of the respect for myself, they did

The story told in one black mirror episode is a perverse, exaggeration, but it makes one good point that should be noted unless you have the requisite knowledge, you have no way of knowing when you have gone too far. I am also a big believer in treating the cause, the root of the problem, rather than the symptoms. So far as I can see, self harm is the symptom. If you are hurting yourself, there is a root cause. And putting that root cause to bed is a good thing.

As someone who self harmed for years, I can say it is like any other addiction. Eventually, you will need more. Whether it is sneaking away in the middle of prom to get your fix in the bathroom with the object you snuck in or being a frequent flyer at the er hospital, because you always need stitches, the severity will eventually increase. And as a disclaimer, I was in your exact mindset, what does it matter if I hurt myself? It prevents me from being suicidal. But in the end, it is just that its not a long term solution I can depend on. Its a quick fix that only gets more severe with time and lands me in the hospital. Its important to realize that self harm, while effective, is not a solution. Its not going to help you improve upon your current situation for long term improvement, you are going to need other coping skills and to give up self harm. Thats your choice to make

Scars are long term physical damage memories of, so are long term damage in your relationship with yourself. Its a huge issue due to the odds of literally dying from one millimeter in the wrong direction. If that does not seem like a problem, you should seek a professionals advice. You should not be so desensitized to this.

Title: Why people with mental health issues rarely recover.
Thread
Psychiatry. As a business, providers have limited time to diagnose to get reimbursed. Diagnosing is subjective criteria for gifted almost matches bipolar. For example, diagnosing is labeling. When we label, we attach everything a person does to that label. This prevents connection. True healing comes from connection. This keeps patients sick. Amp insurance makes more money.
Comments
Diagnosing is labeling. Yes, the way it is helpful is knowing the symptoms that come from that diagnosis. So the grouping of symptoms is beneficial and helpful. It is important for people to know that they are not their diagnosis. It does do more harm than good to identify as a diagnosis. I am a therapist, and unfortunately I have to give a diagnosis or the insurance company will not reimburse pay for therapy. But on the positive side, I know many people who have improved and moved to a point of no longer needing therapy, it can happen. Psychiatry can be a different story. If the prescribed does not encourage doing work, to no longer need a prescription

Title: Desire to leave my home town.
Thread
I am an year old guy. It is my senior year of high school, and I have felt the need to move away from my home state of indiana completely. Whenever I go to places to shop, eat or areas I used to enjoy, they just depress me for some odd reason. And I do not know why I just think of certain places around me where I have grown up, and they bring such negative emotions, even though nothing bad has happened to make me feel that way. I think this feeling might come from my view of being happy in life when there is change and something new. Whenever I go out, it always drains me, and I become bitter, and I cannot help but think it is because of my surroundings. I love my family, and it is not them. I want to move away from bow

I think that what you really want is change not necessarily a change of scenery. But maybe moving is the easiest and surest way to get that change. There are definitely places with more opportunities than indiana. I highly recommend texas. Everybody is relocating to move there, and it is going to be a huge boom state hit me up. Ill tell about when I left home at your age and traveled.

Sorry if this is not the right community to post in, but I have lines of scars on both arms. I am about a year clean with a few relapses here and there, and most of my scars are healed but still noticeable. Ive always loved the winter because I can cover my arms with long sleeves and hoodies. But last summer, people thought I was crazy or on drugs or something, because I would wear long sleeves in degree weather. Its just so embarrassing for someone to see them, and im extremely self conscious about it. With the warm weather coming up, does anybody have any tips like creams or home remedies? Any feedback would help, please, red heart

For professional help. See if you can get a dermatologist referral aside from that, self help and ot options are definitely out there, and they will depend on factors like the type of scarring you have your skin type, etc.

Title: My usually depressed husband has been very up the last few weeks. I would love some insight.
Thread
Hi. I figured I would have more luck posting this. Here is a doctor subreddit. My husband has always been more on the down, depressed side. He is an amazing person, but has definitely had quite a few low periods in his life. He smoked weed oils for about years and started lexapro when he quit about a year ago. He quit the lexapro after about months because he felt good and recently went back on when he realized the lexapro was helping more than he thought. Fast forward to. Now. We just had our fourth child, and he just started back to work after paternity leave. I noticed, right before he went back, he started seeking out any and every friend online, needing to chat. It seemed like he did not care what he was talking about. He just wanted constant interaction. He has started posting on facebook constantly. Like, every thought he has seems to be important enough to post, he has basically been going a million miles an hour and keeps saying he feels great and feels so happy. He seems to always be talking and needing validation on every thought he has. He is helping out with more household duties than ever before and has a lot more energy. I know I should be happy about this, but something just does not feel right. He finally looked at me tonight and said, he thinks it is abnormal at how good he feels. And I felt a little relief that he recognized this.I do not want him to go back to being depressed but his behavior has been a little unpredictable his theory is that maybe the lexapro was helping him the most when he was quitting weed and oils but maybe now his dopamine levels have risen again and the meds are working too well I think maybe he is going into a slight manic episode but I do not know we are going to call the doctor when monday rolls around but I am hoping someone will see this post and give us a little insight his mom does have bipolar but my husband has never been diagnosed with this disorder he is. Could it show up this late if he has masked with weed and alcohol most of his adult life? Thank you to anyone that has read this far I love my husband so much and am just concerned
Comments
There is no hard and fast rule about what age a person has to be when they are diagnosed with anything. There are children as young as six years old being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. There is a streaming show about itconfusion. On the other end. Kat bjelland, of babes in joyland was in her fifties when she was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Your husband behaviour sounds like textbook bipolar disorder. To me, there are other possible explanations, one of which has happened to me a lot in the past, but it would be good to take him to a doctor and discuss the problem

Title: How do I know if I have a mental illness or get screened for an unknown mental illness?
Thread
I feel like I am going insane, but I feel like there is something wrong with me. I think I had depression before, cause in the past, I would not take showers. I would have a hard time getting out of bed. There are more. I dont feel like namingconfusion, but I have gotten a little better since then, but still. And my friend today suggested that I might have anxiety because would not stop asking if he was mad at me. But he remembers the questions when he got screened, and he said, I possibly would end up checking yes for most of them. And there are other things, too, but anyways, I need something to tell me what I have. I do not want to keep self diagnosing myself and then brushing it off. Everything feels like I am faking it, but I dont think I am then thinking, I definitely am faking it. Then I end up questioning everything. Can someone please help

Title: Anxiety panic attacks returned.
Thread
I have had anxiety since I was little. It is genetic there a lot of mental illness in my family. A couple of years ago, I could not sit down at a restaurant and eat a meal with friends without having a panic attack and being so nauseous from anxiety that I had to leave. Now I run my own book club, go out all the time, and life has been good on my new medication until the beginning of this year. My old job was super stressful nurseconfusion, and it has gotten so bad in the hospital. I was starting to have panic attacks in the bathroom at work during my shifts, so I quit without having another job lined up. It took me a few weeks, but I found another job, it still nursing, but I thought it would be less stressful. However, my employer lied to me about the position. The place is disgusting and unsafe, and I hate it. I have been so depressed and anxious. I feel like a zombie from taking too many of my sleeping pills. So I do not wake up in a panic at night or have nightmares. I have been there three weeks and have already called in twice ink. What to do? I want to quit so bad, but I dont think I can handle going to another nursing job right now, any career advice for someone with anxiety

I genuinely feel like I have given myself too many pity parties and wallowed because wallowing makes me feel something.

I was motivated to lose weight and lost pounds, but I have gained that all back plus some eating is the only thing that I look forward to in the day and it sucks. Its the only thing that provides satisfaction. I feel alone. I have friends, but they are married and we barely ever talk. And when we do it is not like it was.

Good thing you posted it. Nothing bad can happen from it. The first thing I thought was to let the overweight thing slide. It will probably fix itself when other things fall into place. The second thing I thought was that you maybe could benefit from, really concentrating on how stuff makes you feel. Meditation is helpful because it helps you see and identify with the reality of your own mind. Check out eckhart toll he helped me a lot remember that everthing is temporary, which includes the feeling you are having now keep at it

Title: Just because you picked up on someone symptoms does not give your right to shrug off their discovery of a diagnosis.
Thread
This happened to me recently with an ocd diagnosis and was one of the hardest things ive ever had to deal with. Not the diagnosis itself, but the fact that my family didnt give a shit because they saw it coming. It makes coping really difficult. I felt like I was ocd, but the materialization of the diagnosis was a lot, especially because I had a med change to treat it specifically still, my family didnt seem to care until I called them out. They had the nerve to justify their reaction. Ugh!

Title: How to control my anger.
Thread
Ink where to post this at im. And I have a hard time controlling my emotions, especially when im angry. I tend to lash out on people or say things to purposely hurt them. Also in the heat of the moment, whoever is around me is going to get the bad end of the stick. I can recognize this quality about myself, but I do not know how to handle it. I do not know how to control my emotions. I feel like I act out on my emotion right away. And that is when things get bad, I really want to change it, but im struggling really bad. I do not like myself when im mad and I hate the way I act, because it makes me feel like a horrible person, even though I know im not. I do not know why I let my anger or sadness control the way I act. Im not sure if this is deep rooted or that I just do not have any self control. Does anyone have any advice on what to do or why I act this way it is ruining my relationships and friendships. And overall, I feel so absorbed into that one emotion that it can control, the way I treat people, even the ones I love. I also get irritated so easily, it is like one minor thing, and it is a flip of a switch. Theres so much more I could type about this, but I think I summarized it as bestAs I could. My parents tel me, it is be im young, and I will eventually learn self control, but I feel like it is deeper than that. Why am I like this? Do you think I can change? Like I do not even know where to begin, it is exhausting being like this. I feel like im so self sabotaging, I need to fix it because I cannot keep hurting others, and this drains my energy. I sit and think about this constantly, but keep doing the same things. It is like, im in a endless loop. I believe in myself that I can change. I just do not know where to start. Maybe a therapist,

Yes, therapist is a great start. What you describe is definitely not a sign of good health that you can see you are hurting others and want to stop is probably the healthiest thing I have read in your post. A therapist can help you figure out how to stop. I hope it all goes well for you.

But when I do set boundaries for myself, I do not know I just end up feeling guilty, and it bothers me for days, I feel like I just should make things easier for everyone else by not setting boundaries. If you had a good, well intentioned reason to set up a boundary to achieve a desired outcome. Try to remind yourself of that whenever emotions like guilt come up as a way to balance things out.

The way to get more comfortable with it is by practicing self validation it will help you stop belittling your own problems need for boundariesconfusion and so you will actually treat them with the level of importance they deserve working on. Your mental health can be self focused at times but that is not the same as selfish happy face or smiley.

Title: I cannot be alone with myself anymore.
Thread
Hopelessness is catching up to me. It is been a long time coming, but a sudden arrival. I am a marionette with taut strings and loose limbs, and the instant they drop, I collapse with it. Night after sleepless night has left me exhausted. But every time I lay down, the darkness is full. With the looming inevitable, it was easier to outrun everything when the future was full of handholds. Only now it is slick and empty, pitted more every day, with gaps so deep the pressure will crush you before reaching the ground. That fall is what brought me here in the first place. I am beginning to wonder if there is more to it. I am awake. I always am it midnight now, but soon it will be three or four, and I will still be awake. Memories do not ask for your consent any more than the people who put them there. Evil breeds evil, or something like that. It sounds clever enough, does not it? Clever words from stupid, broken, ugly mouths? I remember through the static, I remember enough bleeding in a room full of people unable to leave and too numb to run out the door, I remember being sent to bed in a house that was not mine, because I was kept from going home, bandaids over gashes and split lips that tasted sour, cold beds, cold sheets, and the sound of the door creaking at. I remember the whispers in my ear every time they woke up,Beside me? I never slept I still haven. At this point will I ever? How dare your ghost walk the corridors of my mind? How dare you have come where you were never wanted and stay where you are hated I have said my goodbyes someday I will say them and mean it one final time and nothing to follow. There is nothing more. You will mean to me it not that I will hate you do not deserve the thought you never did. Will this be enough to earn an hour earlier? Is it enough to put thoughts to words and those words to sentences? What else do I have? What else that does not make me bleed this is it shaping the haze into something like this, dragging it from the fucking static in my head. I am so cold and tired my heart is beating like it did all those times years ago, too slow and hard but quick enough that it is hard to breathe. How many rain checks will breakdown take? We re playing mental health roulette, and every chamber is loaded, but one

Title: I am so tired of fighting.
Thread
Three years ago, I survived a suicide attempt, and afterwards, my younger brother made me promise to try and get help, and at the very least, try to make it to years old. He said, who knows things might change? Things might get better. So put of love and respect for him I did, but it hasn. I tried therapy got on some meds, etc. But I still feel the same. I feel lonely, exhausted, worthless and empty, just like I did back then. Everyday is like a battle, a war, and I am just so tired of fighting. I just want to be at peace. I am going to be this year. So my promise is rapidly approaching its end, and maybe so is my life. I just do not think I could keep this up for another or years or however long I would live naturally. No one in my life really understands. I know everyone has problems, but I am the only person I know that lacks everything, and at this point in life, should I have friends and a family that love me? But they are all doing things with their lives, having families and careers, etc. And I just have none of that I tried. I did everything I was told you were supposed to do to be a functional adult, and it just has not worked out. I have not even had a date in years, minus the tinder date that stood me upconfusion. And I tried, going back toSchool for something I really love doing but I just do not think I am smart enough for it just cannot anymore I am sad that it will hurt my loved ones but I feel like I need to do what is best for me

Title: I am afraid people will leave me. Is this some kind of relationship trauma? But it is been years already.
Thread
Yeah, currently I am in the stage of getting know each other with someone I know from a dating app. Just call him confusion. He seems nice till now, but everytime he become very slow respond, I always have these thoughts like, he bored of me, I know it or prepare for the worst, because people will leave. In the end, I become really anxious when he didnt reply me fast. I afraid people will leave me, so I tend to act like I dont care and setting my walls up. I was in a really toxic relationship. Years ago, my ex abused my mental health with his toxic behaviour and words. He logged into my email account on his phone so he can track all of my activities. He often asked me why I opened whatsapp when he was sleeping and accuse me cheating with another guy. Also, I lost my mom months ago, and I have discovered it recently that I tend to stalk this a person. Often when I got spare time before I was with this a person. Other guy approached me and think he is possessive, just because he record me without my permission. Even he showed it afterwards, are all of these related. Do I still live in trauma?

I usually have good to great experiences going inpatient. One good thing I would they remind me of my emergency anxiety medicine and encourage me to take that. So I do not get to the point if having anxiety attacks, they talk to me when I am having really disturbing self harm thoughts about performing surgery on myself. And it really helps to voice those thoughts to someone else and hear that I do not have to act on them to get them to go away. The hospital I go to usually has amazing food, and I order cherry pie with every meal.

I have got one. So I had got put into psych as a result of severe depression. And as I got there, the first patient I saw was a girl in a white dress facing away from me as I walked up to the counter to talk with the staff. But before I could get there, she turned around and we locked eyes for a moment. I spent my whole stay at that hospital, just having a good time with that girl. I even got her number afterwards. All in all things worked out pretty well. As a result of that hospital visit, it was funny, because the staff kept warning me she was crazy, just not in those wordsconfusion, but I like crazy.

Its a much needed break from reality. You have no responsibilities except to yourself. You do not have to emotionally support a spouse or a family member. You do not feel like you have to pretend to be happy. You do not have to cook or clean. You get to just focus on you and your health.

Okay, I am going to find it hard to talk about my experiences in mental hospitals because the ones available to me in my present circumstances are all public, and I live in an english speaking country. Mental hospitals involve a lot of interaction with other people, positive and negative other patients, doctors et cetera, a good thing about them is that you might roll the dice well and get to find people you can talk to without feeling uneasy. There is also the possibility of a positive experience with a doctor. One prescribed me a pill that has helped me get a more regular, stable, sleeping experience. Granted, it also makes my dreams very vid and unpleasant. But considering that I used to fall asleep at three in the afternoon after struggling since midnight the previous night, I will take improvement where I can get it. I also find it fun to mess with the people on staff, not like challenging or so on, just doing or saying silly things that make them scratch their headsconfusion. For example, when I was given a form to fill out, there was a clear border around the text area of the form that had no writing on it. I knew why, but just because I am me, I wrote okay in that space, and I have come out of a room in front of one nurse who understood what I was about quoting from a butthole surfers song. The end of the song has a man saying thatHe is the ultimate god is second to him. He is number one and so on. I quoted the whole verse, so those who heard me knew I was joking, but the nurse said, do not let the doctors catch you saying that relief from deep anxiety causes me great feelings of flightiness and complete loss of seriousness. What of it? Probably my favourite moment in a mental hospital came when the doctor that prescribed the pills that restored my ability to sleep told me that nurses were asking her why I was not placed in one of the more secure wards. She apparently told them that I had been relieved of a level of stress that would make a mother of quintuplets blush, why I was not diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder, then I will never know. But mental hospitals are places where you make your own fun. And if you are clever enough, there is plenty of fun to be made

They take care of you and they let you have someone to talk to at all hours at any point you can ask a nurse to talk to you for a while. If you need something to get off your chest, youre truly never alone, which is a beautiful thing. You also get to talk to people who have had similar experiences to you and hear about how they are getting better and working towards recovery.

I honestly have never had a truly horrible experience. I cannot say any hospital was fantastic, but more they were fine. It was not comfortable. But when you are in crisis, it is where you need to be. And when I say not comfortable, I mean, mostly neutral if there is more than one hospital in your area and you have the energy, you can see if google turns up any useful information with patient reviews. Personally, I live in a major city and have recommendations from friends for where to go and personal experience with one place that the problem was really the facilities not having been renovated since. Who knows when? But I have always met some decent people in the hospital, and that is probably the most important part for me. Please do what you need to do to be safe. Chances are it will be fine, and you will be able to get to a more stable place with a plan for what to do. Going forward. Partial hospitalization after discharge can be a really useful tool for adjusting back to the world with some support. And some places have some decent art or occupational therapy take care of yourself. It can get better

You should go in if you really need to make the best of it. Everyone is different. Each experience will be different. You are put on a schedule, you will not have to worry about meals and snacks, they will have it all ready for you are given classes to participate in, try to participate in everything. Even if it seems silly, you will meet with a psychiatrist and a therapist. They may ask your family to come in with your permission to get you to support on the outside. Once you leave, like the first person said, you will leave with a plan. Really, it is not that bad. It is can be overwhelming. Ask your therapist before they have you admitted what to expect, what they know about the place. If they can tell you other patent experiences

Before I went in, I was very convinced that I did not have the energy or motivation to do anything but lay in bed while I was there. They made me do stuff. It was a nice reminder that I am capable of doing things without my phone to numb me. I played a lot of cards with the other people there, and I read a ton.

You may be able to get some answers to your issues in writing which can be useful in getting further help through education, disability plans or some third thing I cannot think of right now I put myself in the ward for a month at the age of and that is probably the most beneficial thing I got from it. Coupled with a bit more insight on what was going on with me, I did have a lot of problems with it, but I do not think itl ever be bad. Check yourself in if you feel you need it better to try and seek intensive help than end up dead. I hope you things improve for you soon. I get the position you are in right now and I certainly empathize. Best of luck, happy face or smiley

I live at an adult foster care home in duluth. In tonight, I made bits for dinner no harm, no foul. While eating dinner, a female client tried to get in my face and start a fight. I ignored her, and she almost pushed me out of my chair and spit on me, calling me a pussy for not fighting. I left the table and called for help. Duluth ad called the staff on duty, and the staff on duty told the police not to respond. I wanted to press charges, but the staff did not want to do the paperwork and took it upon themselves to refuse me the right of law enforcement. My rights at this company have been broken numerous times. This is not the it time I have had to go to reddit for help. What should I do? I am male and labs. I do not fight. I am days away from moving out and do not want to hamper this chance to move out on my own. Anything will help. Thanks.

Title: In what ways does trauma have to be handled differently compared to other issues? In order to see progress, I am stuck trying to fix how I am feeling but to no avail.
Thread
In late november, I experienced something that immediately put me into a depressive episode. I rarely get them, but they are insanely hard to get out of where I am unhappy. All of the time can barely tolerate existing day to day, stop enjoying things I previous did lose almost all ability to be productive, etc. I am sure you know exactly what I mean. My mental health professionals have agreed that I am exhibiting textbook trauma reactions, feelings to the particular experience, and are approaching recovery from that perspective. Now, I am someone who really values self analysis, reflection and figuring out ways to improve. I absolutely fucking hate this state I am in. So I am doing. All the things I know are meant to help heal oneself things like not ignoring my feelings, accepting them, finding distractions that make me happy, talking to trusted individuals about what is been going on and keeping distance from what caused the bad eventconfusion. However, apparently, trying to speedrun recovery does not necessarily work, let alone with trauma. I am not savvy with. How it needs to be dealt with. Seems like it is a lot more sensitive of a process that goes beyond the typical ways one would improve their mental health state, nor is it linear. Unfortunatelyconfusion, I do not know, but any thoughts or advice would be appreciated. As I have been stuck like this for almost months, and I need to become an actual person again, rather than a useless corpse that criesFor no reason I just want to get better, but I clearly do not know the way to do it with trauma, feeling pretty desperate for a solution or at least to be shown a helpful path to go down. Thank you any. And all comments are encouraged.

Do you have a therapist? The gold standard for ptsd treatment is either cognitive processing therapy or prolonged exposure. Both have been prominently researched by dod and va to treat veterans and service members who experienced combat traumaconfusion. Each is slated for sessions, with many individuals experiencing positive benefits even before treatment ends. Some people may do multiple rounds or attempt both to address different core components of trauma. There are many other psychotherapies for trauma, but the scientific evidence base is either weaker or much less researched. Therapists who think you should be in therapy for years to address trauma may be uninformed, undertrained or looking to keep a long term cash pay client on the books, limo, antidepressants can help to a degree, and prazosin can sometimes help those with prominent physiological arousal experience less nightmares. But both are more bandaids than solutions

For context going forwartongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. I had an ex when I was young that treated me absolutely abhorrently. Alcohol was always involved ever since ive had some sort of trauma response in regards to being around and speaking to drunk people, he hanging out with a friend and texting me and when I expressed concerns at him getting a little too tipsy, he went off about how he doesnt do this frequently, how I need to man up and how im ruining his night. Even though he knows I have this trauma. He is acting as if I like this on purpose, and as if he thinks im a pussy for experiencing this, its not something I can just fix overnight and not something I willingly experience. What do I do more just happened as I was typing this, and now hes acting like im a villain. When I just explained how I felt I feel lost and guilty for potentially ruining his night

I just turned and have not consistently felt satisfied with life since I was I genuinely love writing and creating art and it makes me feel alive but I have not really been inspired and motivated in a long time everything feels forced and when I go to try and write something it feels like my mind starts walking in thick knee deep mud to most people that sounds lame and it probably is but art was literally something that gave me life like nothing else and not being able to do it feels like a heartbreak not to mention a traumatic family event happened in that had my family split from my dad now my mom and I have reconciled with him but my siblings have not and I totally understand I love them all but I feel like I have no idea what to do and I always feel awkward around my siblings, and I avoid talking about my parents at all costs and try to come across as if I do not care about them, even though I live with them at the moment, which is another thing I do not think I fully know how to feel. I genuinely feel like I have given myself too many pity parties and wallowed because wallowing makes me feel something.

Title: An un healthy amount of sadness.
Thread
I am just so sad and like ink, who to talk to. I feel like I am alone, and I just want to stop being sad every time I get in my truck, I hope someone hits me and it kills me. I have not told anyone how I felt. And reddit is the only place I could think of like I cry almost every night, like I have never been like this until recently.
Comments
Given that you drive a truck, I believe that you need to go to a doctor as soon as possible. Having someone hit you in your truck is not going to accomplish anything. In fact, it will make you feel worse, because your chance of dying is a lot smaller than the occupants of any smaller car. If you get in a crash and survive, you may end up with the well known phenomena called survivor guilt on your plate, given that you have never been like this until recently, visiting a medical professional about this would be a very good idea, especially since they can give you much better and more specific advice.

Title: I have urges to move all the time and I hate it what the do i
Thread
So the movement, I mean, is like curling my toes, getting any fabric between my fingers or simply rubbing my fingers between each other, stretching my legs due to my discomfort with my knees, theyare super knobbly, and I feel like I can feel my knee cap movingconfusion, having to constantly roll my neck around and also stretching my arms. The veins on the opposite side of my elbow stick out, and it makes me feel weird. I feel like I can literally feel everything inside me rubbing together my bones, joints, flesh, veins. It feels like a menthol type feeling in my bloodconfusion, and sometimes my organs, like my gut rubbing with my kidney, etc. Or my brain wobbling inside my skullconfusion. Sometimes it gets very overwhelming and makes me think about removing certain parts of my body nearly like it would be more comfortable to just be empty. If that makes sense, it can get to a point where if I am already stressed or upset, I will just break down due to the discomfort. I also get a similar feeling when my hands are overly dry, sweaty or wet for long periods, like washing dishes, for example. But I wear gloves to avoid thatconfusion. I really do not know where to post this, but I am just hoping someone can relate, and or maybe give me advice on what to do if someone knows a better place to post, please, let me know. But I am fairly sure this is a mental healthThing possibly linked to my anxiety or ocd. But whenever I bring it up to any therapist I have had, they do not really say anything sorry for the long post or any formatting issues.

Have you looked into potential adhd? I am currently going through assessments for it myself, and what you are describing resonates with me. A constant feeling of restlessness is one of the symptoms of adhd to dispel a common myth about adhd. It is not a mental health disorder that always manifests as hyperactivity and misbehaviour in children. I am not advocating you diagnose yourself, but it might be helpful to check out a few online resources about adhd and see if you relate to any. And if so, discuss the options with your doctor for a professional opinion

Title: Is it normal to get angry when things do not go according to plan?
Thread
Hello I am posting, because as the title suggests, I get very angry when things do not go how they were originally planned. It will not even be something I was particularly looking forward to, and it will make me so upset. For example, my mother had planned to pick me and my grandmother up and take us to dinner, but she arrived minutes later than she had originally said. I know that this is not at all a big deal, and it happens all the time, but it make me so incredibly angry for some reason. Is this a normal reaction.
Comments
I also have this for me it is a sign of anxiety. I expect things to go a certain way and they don and that makes me anxious and then I get angry because I feel anxious and out of control it might help to talk to someone. I am currently on anti anxiety meds and they have helped a lot. Also, a good trick is to remember you cannot control other people behaviour, only your reaction to it. If you can remember this and recognise your anger as being a reaction to the other person behaviour, you can begin to control it and change your reaction. Remember, nobody can make you feel anything they behave a certain way and you react. You cannot control their behaviour, but you can control your reaction hope this helps

My parents often tell me I need to start doing things on my own such as cleaning cooking and doing my hair I struggle with all those things I know I have to learn to do them once I move but I just cant im confusion. The thought of me moving out and being by myself sounds stressful meaning I have to do adult stuff. I am so extremely indecisive. Whenever my mom asks me what I want from the store I do not know what to say, so I just say anything forcing me to make a decision stresses me. I also do not know what to get for my birthday or christmas. My parents are nicer to me now in the past, they whipped me and act aggressiveconfusionbut. When I rant to my friends about them. When they make me upset, I make them sound awful. I am also afraid. I am too self absorbed when I am talking with my friends. I usually just want to talk about what I want to talk about, but I still try to consider their feelings and let them have their turns. They say people with this disorder need a new relationship immediately after a break or something, but I would not know. I do not like being alone, but I find it hard to imagine being abandoned. Plus, I do not have much experience on relationships. I only have online friends and could not keep an in real life friend because we moved so much forSome reason I get really lonely at times is this did or something else. I have also been diagnosed with adhd and gad. Another thing I was also bullied during the first grade. My parents unintentionally downplay my feelings. They do not have a positive relationship with each other.

So my parents have been fighting so much lately, and I already have heavy depression, and it is making things so much worse. Tonight, they were screaming at each other as usualconfusion, and they were talking about drinking, drug use. Ect me and my mom have always have been super close. Unlike me and my dad, and tonight she said, fuck both of you, which pretty much ruined me. I love my mom to death. And it hurt so much to hear her say that im supposed to be going up to my hometown to visit tomorrow until wednesday. And she told me that im not aloud to go because of how disrespectful and rude I am. I dont think she realizes how bad im doing mentally, even though she is my biggest support system and knows pretty much everything, abt me? But she does not know I am literally on the edge of giving up. I have no idea to cope with this, and on top of all of that, ive completely stopped caring. Abt my health. Im still a young teenager, and I really wish I did not live like this.

Title: I hate this. I want to be normal.

After all my life, feeling less than human, feeling like I am worth nothing and feeling like I am just a dumb, lazy piece of shit. I found out what is wrong with me executive disfunction. I know things I have to do. I know I have to clean my room. It will help me feel accomplished. I know I should go out for a run. It will help me feel better and get more fit. I know I need to lift the dumbbell a bit. It will help me stay in shape. I know I need to study. It will help my grades, I know, but I can. I know the actions I have to do, but I cannot execute the actions, not because I do not want to, but because my brain will not let me. I cannot command my life. I want to do something so badly. And yet, my brain never gives me the necessary emotional to get up and do it. I am aware of the fact I am actively choosing not to take part in actions that would help improve myself, and I cannot help it. I am trying my absolute best. There been times when I lifted weights at the gym, where my arm would just start falling, not because it did not have the necessary amount of strength to go on, but because my brain could not provide it. The necessary amount of will to go on. And that is the perfect metaphor for my life. I haveStarted many hobbies that I ended up losing interest in and putting off for later, yet I never came back to. After several years, I have failed every job I ever had for, not putting in the energy I am in college now. But even though it is at a snail pace, I feel myself getting anxious over every single time I know I have an exam coming up dreading my existence, because I know in days, I have to use my brain again. The dopamine hit of completing an exam is not there because I achieved something. It is there because I know I can now revel in the fact that I won have to achieve anything for a little while, at least until the next exam comes through. I hate this. I want to be normal. I want to be stimulated and be in command of my life.

Executive dysfunction often results from a few things including abuse. It is a terribly underdiagnosed and often improperly treated condition. It is of a edf from a facebook page promoting the cause of neurodivergent people, among which executive dysfunction is far too common. If you wish to see the facebook page, please let me know you do not have to scroll down too far to find the original posts of the contents of the edf. I am trying to link.

Title: I hate this. I want to be normal.
Thread
After all my life, feeling less than human, feeling like I am worth nothing and feeling like I am just a dumb, lazy piece of shit. I found out what is wrong with me executive disfunction. I know things I have to do. I know I have to clean my room. It will help me feel accomplished. I know I should go out for a run. It will help me feel better and get more fit. I know I need to lift the dumbbell a bit. It will help me stay in shape. I know I need to study. It will help my grades, I know, but I can. I know the actions I have to do, but I cannot execute the actions, not because I do not want to, but because my brain will not let me. I cannot command my life. I want to do something so badly. And yet, my brain never gives me the necessary emotional to get up and do it. I am aware of the fact I am actively choosing not to take part in actions that would help improve myself, and I cannot help it. I am trying my absolute best. There been times when I lifted weights at the gym, where my arm would just start falling, not because it did not have the necessary amount of strength to go on, but because my brain could not provide it. The necessary amount of will to go on. And that is the perfect metaphor for my life. I haveStarted many hobbies that I ended up losing interest in and putting off for later, yet I never came back to. After several years, I have failed every job I ever had for, not putting in the energy I am in college now. But even though it is at a snail pace, I feel myself getting anxious over every single time I know I have an exam coming up dreading my existence, because I know in days, I have to use my brain again.

Title: I need some advice.
Thread
I feel as though my home and my mind has become a prison constant negative thoughts in my head and verbal emotional abuse in my home my room literally went from a place to sleep to a classroom and now a prison I know that I have good mental fortitude but there is only so much is one can take there a lot of other things that affect me but not as much as this does I cannot go out I cannot see my friends I cannot even do my homework in peace I usually do it at night between am because that is when I am left alone but I guess not anymoreconfusion I hate living with my grandmother it was cool right up until the pandemic everything was fine but after that I do not know what happened she became so verbally aggressive and demanding I just cannot take it anymore. Its not like I cannot live with my parents either because of they are poor life choices they do not have a proper home shit. My mother is not even in the country, and my dad is basically useless. I do not want to tell them that I am no longer comfortable living with my grandmother because they ask her if what I say is true and it escalate into an argument between everyone and I hate arguing. The only reason I chose to live with my grandmother is because I know I be in a better place than wherever my parents are.But over these last years, she defeated the whole purpose of that. I literally do all the chores in and around the house, yet she still complains that I do nothing. She says, I move to slow. Its not like she can do any better. She can barely walk, yet she still criticizes everything I do. She tells everyone that she is teaching me to do things. But that is just the sorry excuse that she uses as justification for making me do everything she makes my life so much harder. She constantly berates me, always saying something hurtful and insulting. Whenever I tell her about it, she says that the way she is, as I said before, I have good mental fortitude, I can take alot of mental load, but this cannot go on. I think the reason she does this is because she knows I can take all of the shit she has to say. So she uses me as a way to vent her lifetime of anger and sadness. A while ago, as in minsconfusion, I was doing some homework, and she turned off the wifi router because she thought that I was up to late. So I had to buy a data plan on my phone, so I can type this out. I really do not know that to do anymore or who to turn to. The only hope I can hold on to is a really small investment in crypto. I am about to make and even that does not seemTo promising because of the bearish market right now, may I please have some advice and or words of encouragement

Title: I was spit on by another client and the staff told the police not to respond.
Thread
I live at an adult foster care home in duluth. In tonight, I made bits for dinner no harm, no foul. While eating dinner, a female client tried to get in my face and start a fight. I ignored her, and she almost pushed me out of my chair and spit on me, calling me a pussy for not fighting. I left the table and called for help. Duluth ad called the staff on duty, and the staff on duty told the police not to respond. I wanted to press charges, but the staff did not want to do the paperwork and took it upon themselves to refuse me the right of law enforcement. My rights at this company have been broken numerous times. This is not the it time I have had to go to reddit for help. What should I do? I am male and labs. I do not fight. I am days away from moving out and do not want to hamper this chance to move out on my own. Anything will help. Thanks.
Comments
Is leaving the house for a walk and going to the nearest police station, an option, if so do. And if someone from the home tries to stop, you push them out of the way, hit them if you have to, in the future, hamper this chance to move out on my own will be called what it is blackmail. People like these staff are bullies. And if I have learned just one thing in my life, it is that bullies do not stop until they definitively learn that you have teeth. Any means you can use go to the police. Their actual purpose is to be teeth. For people like you

Title: Serious question about self motivation.
Thread
I need help finding a way to cope with my intense belief that attempting something difficult which requires a short term sacrifice but no guarantee of the desired positive outcome is completely pointless quick backstory on an important relatable and life changing part of my past at years old now I can confidently say that my mom was a completely and whole heartedly good person perfect of course not, but everything that good people hope to see in other humans they interact with she lived by the golden rule and honestly tried to improve the lives of those around her and through no fault of her own. It was told to us as just pure geneticsconfusion. She developed colon cancer in her early and passed away at I was at the time of her death and have pretty much since that night held a firm belief that what is the god damn point if something like that can happen to a person living a life like that about as good of a human you can get just ended for no reason. So now I constantly struggle at attempting anything if that outcome is not a guaranteed. Appreciate anyone who made it this far, any thoughts or suggestions or similar feelings are welcome and appreciated

Title: How are you supposed to go on?
Thread
Temp account for obvious reasons. I have gone through nothing but turmoil all my life. I was born to a shitty place with a horribly dysfunctional family abused and bullied by my peers, rejected and ostracized, despite my best intentions and multiple attempts of bettering myself shouldered responsibilities. I have genuinely seen grown men break under as a teenager done it without thanks or support, only emasculated, ridiculed, mocked, disrespected, unappreciated and hated. I finally broke. I have not been able to function for months. Now, the responsibility is still on my shoulder, though now it stands on a broken back. I feel like I have nothing to lean on. It feels like I could have maybe leaned on having a good social circle to cope with everything else or maybe been able to peruse my now dead passions to escape from everything else. But everywhere I look, I see horror and feel nothing but pain. At years old, not a night has gone by since I was, where I have not begged god to take me. It seems even he, in all his wisdom, has elected to abandon me too. The help of professionals is beyond me too. Due to location, economical situation, I am not looking for sympathy. If you have nothing but kind words to offer, then I kindly ask you to keep them to yourself while well intentioned and appreciated. I am looking for actual advice. How are you supposed to spend the rest of your years truly and completely broken.

Title: What is the purpose?
Thread
What the purpose of living? I do not know tbe I am. In a few days. I still live with my mom. I do not know my dad. I do not have any friends, besides a few online friends. I met them in real life, but they live too far away. I am spending my days playing video games and jerking off. Mostly, I do not have any money to my name. I do not have a job, and I am studying law. I do not do anything for it anymore. I am not in death since I live in germany. But still, I am living in a constant bubble of disappointment, dissatisfaction and being stressed by the simplest things in regards to my future. I feel like I have all the time in the world, but I also don. I know I should start working out. I know I need to get a job. I know that I should seek treatment, but everything involving others stresses me. I used to be quite smart, but nowadays, I am just a underachieving failure. I am not addicted to any sort of drugs. At least I am gay and chubby. I am not even sure what I can add to people life. I am not suicidal as of now, but I start to wonder if I am not better off dead. I do not know if it will be better in the future. I honestly have no clue. I just do not want to feel this miserable, almostEvery day.

Title: Failed my driving exam again got called poor cannot tell my parents
Thread
I am really heartbroken. I am diagnosed with depression, and anxiety failed the it time for being so anxious, I could barely move my body to steer and shift gears through a lot of practice, meditation and effort to shift my mindset. Over weeks prior, I was able to keep anxiety levels low, which seemed like a miracle failed due to extreme bad luck, and consequently lost a job opportunity. They were holding the position for me until I passed my examconfusion. So now I am back being unemployed and stuck, asking for rides at years of age. I am a great driver. I am being realistic, my instructor vouches for me, and he was extremely upset that I did not make it. My examiner was extremely harsh and grumpy. I made a mistake on a single, short moment of self doubt after a brilliant exam. As he put it himself, I asked for a chance, but he just basically told me it is not his fault that I am poor and to ask for another exam when I can, I was so shocked that I did not tell him it was because of my job opportunity. Frown, sad, angry or pouting the girl before me did poorly, but her examiner said it was because she was clearly nervous, so she was not herself and passed. I am nervous, too. Frown, sad, angry or pouting. Now I need to get another exam and a few useless classes, and I do not have the money if iTell my parents they will be pissed off at me, and they are very hard to deal with. And now I do not even believe I be able to pass it next time too. My head hurts from crying. I have no friends, too. Only my year old cousin knows about this. I do not really have anyone to turn to I would get a job, but I need the money. This week tops on top of that, my social anxiety is so bad it is hard to even leave the house. I feel like such a failure. No matter how positive I try to be, nothing goes well. So what is the point anymore? I do not even know what I want to do for a living. So you could basically say, I have nothing. And I feel silly every time I try to be positive, because it is clearly not taking me anywhere

Last year, I was in exactly same situation as you. I was with depression and anxiety driving since I was a child, but could not pass my exam after I failed the red time. I was seriously suicidal. I asked my doctor for some mental days off in order to copeconfusion. The only way I manage to pass was to give money under the table to my teacher and the examiners. I know it is shitty behaviour, but I thought that I will spend this money anyway the next time I will fail. So I passed at my the time. I am not suggesting that you should do the same, however, is a way otherwise take some xanax or smoke a little weed and hope for the best you are not alone. Sooner or later, you will pass the exam, speak with you parents explain to them why you cannot pass it do not feel desperate. There are a lot of us out in the streets red heart

Title: How can I fit?
Thread
I am a first year college student. I have social anxiety and bad self esteem because of my past. I feel that I have never been accepted by groups of people. I am not talking at the individual levelconfusion because of my introverted nature. I try not to act. Akward and I even set myself goals not to get comfortable in my silence, such as leading a conversation in a group. Nevertheless, it does not usually work out well. In addition, I feel that groups reject me because I am not able to play the game. I do not have a strong presence, and I do not like conflict very much. In addition, moat of my friends are starting to form relationships, and I do not talk with a girl since summer, mainly because of the lack of women in my degreeconfusion. And I think that this is another thing for people in groups to point at and have an even worse image of me. So how can I fit

I am the same. My self esteem is bad, and my autism makes it hard for me to communicate with people sometimes in a group. Im the awkward, quiet friend, and dont really stay in groups because of it. Personally, I dont know how to fit in because I dont think I ever will fit in this world, sadly, looks down on those who are different, but im not ashamed of how I am. My advice to you is work on your social skills and confidence. If you feel your doing your best to fit in and people still dont accept you, they are the problem. Most likely hope this helped a little have a good day.

It been months even back when I was in my own country, I started to feel different I did not want to have sex with my girlfriend I felt empty from times to times or strangely detached from everything like I was only a spectator it only got worse here I had panic attacks during my sleep or I think it was this waking up shaking and feeling too much I do not know how to best describe it, but as too much feelings coming all at once making me want to scream in pain and in hatred hit something, cry anything to let all of these go. Luckily, nobody noticed anything, but I feel I have changed. I want to be mean without any reason, I have to force myself to laugh. I have been crying randomly twice during the last month I had to lock myself in a bathroom and just cry as silently as I could. I will go back soon in my home country. But I do not feel any joy. Everyone is happy and say they cannot wait to see their family, but I just feel empty. I do not care at all. I will see my parents and brothers and I do love them, but I do not feel anything. I feel bad. I am sad for no reason. I am not as motivated as I was. I do not know what is happening to me or why

Title: Scared and lonely.
Thread
Twink or smirk I am scared because of how little I appear to incite positive change and growth into my life I am feeling down today despite my relatively enjoyable week I wonder sometimes because I am on screens a lot that I am missing out on interacting with people I know that I am missing out as someone who is currently in college to become a counselor I know that it is really important to be versed in the art of human communication both verbally and non, verbally I waste away in my room playing stupid video games. Instead of furthering my career finding a coop informational interviewsconfusion I choose to escape into the virtual world. I know that I am not going to get very far in real life by always escaping to the computer whenever I feel like I cannot do anything else as someone who has adhd motivation and focus are not easy to regulate. I have a book that I have been meaning to read, people with whom I have been meaning to talk to and aspirations that I do not seem to have the energy for maybe I do have the energy. However, it is very difficult for me to find that drive. I know that drive is currently working in me and that is why I feeling really down. However, will it be enough for me to get moving with my life? Or will I continue to escape to porn reddit games, youtube, etc. I took a test aWhile back a personality test, utilizing the big traits and broke them down into smaller bits. So in total, turns out I am in the it percentile of industriousness. That means in a room of people, I would be less industrious than of them, like, how the fuck am I like this? How the actual fuck have I made it to where I am renting alone, managing a social life, talking with family, working once a week and maintain decently high grades. It may sound like a flex, but jesus, I do not know how much farther this little drive of mine will take me. I am scared that I am not good enough, scared that I will not find a girlfriend, scared that I will not be able to settle down, have children, have a house, have a well paying job? I am scared shitless. I am a decently attractive guy, but that shit do not do much when there is a fucking battle within my head. I ruminate a lot, and so I can see where someone anyone really could find a valid reason to find me disgusting and terrible? Is there really someone out there who will be able to empathize with me and choose to settle down with me? Because goddamn, I do not think that I would settle down with me. I am scared of my ego as well of putting myself it. I want to help people not because helping people is better for society, but because helping people makesMe feel happy. I want to be happy. That is all this fear is both motivating and crippling, and I do not know what to change that will help or maybe I do.

Title: Anyone else just tired all the time.
Thread
No matter how much sleep I get, I am always tired. I have had bags under my eyes for I cannot even remember how long couple to a few years, at least not to mention. Everything seems so impossible, like anything that involves walking up and getting out of bed is a struggle, which sucks because falling asleep is impossible. I cannot shut my brain off, and I basically just have to wait to pass out what the is my brain doing to me? What is wrong up there

I am tired when I think of suicide, and it somehow comforts me to fall sleep.

Yep. Same here. Quetiapine and olanzapine at night helps a little bit with falling asleep, and vyvanse during the day helps a little bit with staying awake, really, though I feel they just mask whatever the real issue is of which I am still not sure.

Its exactly what I have to a dot. I am adhd bipolar, and only adhd medication mixed with mild antipsychotic medication helps, but like it is a god send, I fall asleep in a blink. Now, the songs, the sounds, the recounting my day and obsessive thinking just completely stops.

What the purpose of living? I do not know tbe I am. In a few days. I still live with my mom. I do not know my dad. I do not have any friends, besides a few online friends. I met them in real life, but they live too far away. I am spending my days playing video games and jerking off. Mostly, I do not have any money to my name. I do not have a job, and I am studying law. I do not do anything for it anymore. I am not in death since I live in germany. But still, I am living in a constant bubble of disappointment, dissatisfaction and being stressed by the simplest things in regards to my future. I feel like I have all the time in the world, but I also don. I know I should start working out. I know I need to get a job. I know that I should seek treatment, but everything involving others stresses me. I used to be quite smart, but nowadays, I am just a underachieving failure. I am not addicted to any sort of drugs. At least I am gay and chubby. I am not even sure what I can add to people life. I am not suicidal as of now, but I start to wonder if I am not better off dead.

I feel angry right now because of something personal I am not in the mood for is I have no interest in killing myself because I know how much damage I will cause for my loved ones what should I do to make myself feel better amp

The question I am responding to is the last one how to feel better? I have learned that there is no point in trying to sell people on the idea that life has meaning. A lot of people are complaining that it is hard to get therapy since the lockdown and you may want to look at online therapy and self help what I usually tell people treatment usually begins by seeing the go, who can give you a referral? I mention referral because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day, any symptoms you might have such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life, affecting how you feel if you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lihelp. With depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this one practical advice for motivation, very important

A sense of emotional numbness is often a symptom of depression there no reason why someone with autism cannot be depressed possible depression is one reason for seeing a qualified professional the other reason is that if you suspect autism you should get a proper diagnosis and treatment for it a lot of things can help with depression standard treatments and the self help recommended by therapists I have advice from experts in my comments and you can click on my name and read if you suspect autism you might want to see asperger from the inside this is the youtube channel of an intelligent young man with autism

Hey. Op everytime you take off that bandage to reapply with a new one, you have actually tore off the new blood clot that is trying to form. So if it soaks through, just apply more bandages, gauze on top with firm pressure for mins, and do not take the bandage off for a day or two and drink juice.

Put your hand on the wound and apply firm pressure. Keep your hand there with steady pressure in time, it should stop bleeding.

I wish I knew what to say, but I do not since I am in the same situation, except I am already living with my grandma, dropped out of my masters because of my social anxiety and depression. Have no idea what I want to do in the future cannot get a license, even stuck at home since I was only have one friend and it is online. Get anxious when I have something to do, get anxious. When I am not doing anything, I cannot really offer support, but at least know that ur not alone.

Long version we both quit smoking. He is since been promoted. And after an argument where I did not chase after him, he bought cigarettes. Fair enough, I knew he would. Valentines days comes and I could smell it despite him eating chewing gum, etc. I asked him. He said, yes, he had still been smoking. I felt complete betrayed. I know it sound hypocritical, as I used to smoke, too, but for me was all the apologies and promises then going behind my back. Spending our money is what hurt I do not think he gets this. I suggested some counselling for the fact I am trying to prevent this and or other things becoming a bigger issue. He has made the decision to sleep on the sofa until further notice. I am now on mat leave from a role I too, was promoted to and find myself sobbing uncontrollably. I lost my mum last year. I have felt this week he is given me zero support. I feel lonely and being the housewife is not for me. I am conscious. I am pregnant and would never intentionally hurt my baby but cannot help but hope I die straight after birth twink or smirk. I am almost weeks pregnant and after an argument that is lasted all week, all I keep hoping is that I haemorrhage and die after having baby

Title: Us teacher in crisis where to go from here.
Thread
I have struggled with depression since elementary school. However, my family is very much controlled by the stigma of mental illness, and I am not even sure they think they believe me that I have a mental illness and have never offered real support during my struggles. I have gone to counseling off and on. For about years I started taking anti depressants my first year as a teacher. So about years, I have tried several medications and some work better than others. My psych medicine is prescribed by my primary care doctor, and we did a dna test to see which options would work well for me, things were ok the last few months, it seems like everything is getting worse. I am not successful at work largely due to my depression. The house that I live in is in shambles. I struggle to have the motivation to clean it, and there is so much unpacking to do. I am trying to fix up and sell a house we moved out of in august. My parents are nagging me to finish the projects and get it on the market. My husband of years, is working massive overtime and is stressed by his job. My family thinks I am not taking care of the house that I am a living in and lecturing, berating us about cleanliness and upkeep, because we could not find a house in our price range in the area we would like to live. To be clear the area we were consideringWas over a mile radius confusion and are staying in a house that they own and rent out that used to belong to my great grandparents because I moved school districts at the start of this school year to escape a toxic work environment I do not have many friends close by to offer support and I very much feel like I need to be able to prove myself at work and do not feel like I can share may struggles I feel an obligation to keep just pushing through because we are at the end of a term and I need to finish coming materials and administer and complete grading for students on time taking a break seems impossible I feel like I cannot do anything right I feel like I disappoint everyone I feel no hope that things will improve I cannot shake the feeling that everyone would be better off happier if I was not around my primary care doc said I should probably see a psychiatrist because they would be more effective in managing my medications I have requested a recommendation from her and am having trouble finding someone in my area that can see me soon and work with my schedule at all because it is almost impossible to find a substitute teacher at this time spring break in coming up in a few weeks and I had a thought that perhaps some time spent in patient program during spring break might help me make some progress but I do notKnow how that process works. I called a help line, hoping they could explain the progress, and basically told me that if I felt I was a danger to my self, I should go to the emergency room and they would make the determination. But that did not seem like what I had in mind at all. I have honestly left out a lot of additional stressors, because at some point it just seems like I am making it up. I am not sure why I am posting here. I guess I hope someone can help me understand what some possible next steps are or how to navigate the system at this point.

I must admit I do not have a heap of advice, but god, do I know this feeling? I think maybe it is tied to a lack of self esteem, so I found to fix it. I actually had to look inwards, which is a positive, because we have a lot more chance at fixing ourselves. I am not sure about your diagnoses, but this is a theme that seems to resonate with borderline personality. Now, I am not saying you have bad, but some of the techniques taught in dialectical behaviour therapy may help, so maybe a google of some debt exercises may be beneficial, and I think to borrow a tip from acceptance commitment therapy, naming these thought patterns. Ie oh yeah, here is such. And such thoughts, again, may seem simple, but helps give us some distance from these thoughts, especially when they are not a true representation on how we want to feel.

My sister recently has come to me about an issue that has prevented her from doing her chores. It seems like nothing when you word it like that but let me explain recently whenever she goes into the kitchen she gets dizzy and light headed and sometimes has stomach pains and whenever she tries to clean the kitchen she starts breaking down and crying. This has gone to a point where she has thought of self harm to get out of the kitchen and to avoid it. Our parents will only yell and scold us for saying she might need to see counseling as they view it as stress. And I nor my sister can find a definite answer as to why she has these problems. We might reach out to our school for her to get counseling, but I have concerns about the school, either not providing it or just telling her to put it down in a journal, as I have been in school counseling. And all they told me was to do that every timeconfusion

Possibly some adhd and resulting anxiety. I have a hard time finishing or startingconfusion chores and feel defeated and fatigued, often just thinking about it. And the frustration of not being able to get anything done also brings with it different emotions, feelings and physiological responses.

Title: I assaulted a girl and need advice. Please have an open mind.

To give some background to this not to excuse my actions but to explain them I was groomed when I was younger on discord for extended periods of time I was and we still do not know the identity of who it was to this day but we are under the impression that the groomer was in his late the two of us did not set many boundaries in our relationship either this is technically my first ever relationship and this is probably her the in late september of I confusion assaulted my girlfriend at the time confusion the two of us were alone in my room and we were cuddling and I dry humped her thigh even after she told me to stop she told me she thought I only wanted her for her body obviously this is wrong we had dated for months at that point and I poured all of myself into it. We spent almost every day together for over a year as friends. By that point too, I do not seek reconciliation, and the two of us do not talk anymore.

The assault was the dry humping correct whenever a girl says, stop to anything you do it, I suggest now that you acknowledged it, let it go and move on. The fact you feel guilt is a good thing. Do not let this eat you alive and move forward. Good luck, thumbs.

Don blame yourself too hard. Find a therapist to talk wtih and they will understand you did something wrong, but it doesnt mean you are a bad person. You are probably a very awesome and sweet guy and probably had never bad intentions for your girlfriend. Stay strong.

To be frank, if people are viewing you in the light of someone who has sexually assaulted a young girl, they are absolutely valid in that view, while you may not feel, this is an action you would commit again and feel more informed on how your behavior was wrong. The inexcusable truth is that you did engage in assault, and this has lead to the consequence of a lack of trust from others. I understand that your brain was underdeveloped and had been influenced by your own trauma, however, that does not negate the trauma your actions caused another person. My only advice is to work closely with a therapist to build your own self, confidence and self agency work through your trauma and acknowledge your actions that created trauma as well. You cannot change how others view you. Your behavior may sway them if you truly work to change, but this is not within your control. You can control how you view yourself, though, and how you interact with the world around you. Therapy will help you with this. Your therapist can also direct you to next steps, if necessary.

Title: Loose weight is antidepressants.
Thread
Hi, I am sorry for this stupid question, but because of my antidepressants and antipsychotics, my weight change from keg to keg. Every part of my body is bigger, and I feeling really fat, because I am tall. I want like keg, but I do not know how to loose weight when I am on this medication. Do you have some options or something? Thank you and sorry for bothering you, grinning face with sweat.
Comments
Check with your prescribed weight gain is a common side effect of both medications, especially antipsychotics. They may consider changing things up, but could also help connect you with a dietician or another professional who can help you create a healthy eating and or exercise routine. To combat this side effect. If you are not able to get professional help, try to track precisely how many calories you are consuming each day versus what you should for your body weight. If you can get closer to your recommended range, it will be easier to maintain your current weight. If you can hit a deficit, then your body may start to burn off some of the extra weight, and you could reasonably lose a keg, or per week. And exercise or more exerciseconfusion helps a lot too good luck.

I have gone to the hospital so many times recently to see if I have a heart problem because I have a sharp crushing pain in the left side of my chest, and every result comes out perfectly fine, but I do not feel perfectly fine. I feel like I am going to drop dead. I do not want to keep going to the hospital because my parents already think I am faking it and think it will keep coming back negative.

Title: Outgrowing bipolar.
Thread
Hello, all I am growing up. I was diagnosed bipolar at. I used to take respiridone daytrana patches when I got to middle school, I relied less and less, eventually cutting out completely before age. I do not have manic episodes anymore, but do get sad sometimes from feeling lost or lonely, with no hope I wouldnt call it depression episodes, though my question is, can a person actually outgrow bipolar syndrome, or was I misdiagnosed? I also recently picked up smoking marijuana and do not want to quit? Its not affecting my daily life. But consciously, I feel bad about it. Does bipolar affect my addiction
Comments
Childhood bipolar is notoriously hard to diagnose because manic episodes are very subjective and especially in children. What looks like a manic episode to one professional could potentially be developmentally normal behavior to another professional? So it is possible that you were misdiagnosed if you no longer have manic episodes being off medication for years. However, drug induced psychosis, including from marijuana use, is very real and you may be more susceptible based on previous mental health history. Additionally, laced marijuana and synthetic marijuana can be extremely damaging for all individuals.

First, I am not a doctor or expert. This is just my opinion. I would not rule out misdiagnosis, but I am going to take a more broad approach. Mental illness can be affected by many factors age, puberty, drugs, lifestyle, exercise, etc. Any number of these could change how your brain functions on a base level, and also how it interacts with mental illness. Its possible a combination of these factors and perhaps a natural evolution. Your coping mechanisms make it seem like you are no longer bipolar. Assuming your diagnosis is correct, you should continue living as healthy lifestyle as possible that, in a way, keeps the symptoms in check, as they seem to have been as a personal anecdote, I use to smoke marijuana. Quite often, it had a tendency to trigger manic episodes at time and give me anxiety. I would say that I was abusing it, though, be smart about it, and it can be a relaxing thing, as for feeling bad about smoking, be thoughtful about it. Try to explore why you feel bad about smoking, because I am sure there is reasons why

I am so tired of everything I do not see any real reason to live anymore. I have been shown how I do not really matter to anyone and just how much better off people are without me I mean nothing to nobody. After all, the one person I thought cared at some point, at least let me know that she never really did. My only worth is that of a plaything, a test subject, someone for others to step on and forget when I was at my worst, everyone disappeared. And now days are static, uneventful and grey. They have been for the past few years. But I am tired from faking smiles, laughs and pretending that I am ok if I am only here to suffer without anyone or anything to hold onto, I might as well leave

Title: What should i?

It been about since I cut and I am still actively bleeding out of one of them never had it this severe when I get up in I feel like passing out
Comments
Hey, op I am a nurse. I would recommend you go to a hospital, but I know thats not an option for you right now. Is it bleeding a lot or a slow trickle drips if you had to estimate how much blood you have lost, how much would it be when you feel like passing out? Is it just when you stand? Are you dizzy with it? Seeing stars or flashes? Other things you could try to stop the bleeding are applying pressure for a long whileconfusion. Holding the wound closed. You could even try ice with something covering it like a cloth or pillow case to protect your skinconfusion. As it can make the blood vessels constrict to slow the bleeding elevate the area to let gravity help you. If it is part of your body that you can above the level of the heart, is ideal. Try and keep the area clean so it doesnt get infected, drink lots of fluid to replace what you are losing. Its not blood, but its still volume in your blood vessels, which you need. The fact that you feel faint when getting up is concerning me. Try these tips, but you very well may need medical intervention or stitches, at the least, hoping the best for you.

I started panicking because I felt like I was being watched. I thought something in my room had eyes and was watching me. I think I thought my wall had eyes, but it could have been something else. Then I got this strange craving for flesh. After maybe minutes, I snapped out of it. I do not know what just happened to me. All I know is that I do not want it to happen again.
Comments
I do not want to freak you out. But what you say about the wall is very strange. When people talk about this fear, it is usually a fear of a hidden camera. I will mention a possible explanation. Sometimes we will be dreaming but not be aware of it. This is called hypnagogic hallucination. It why the great majority of ghost sightings happen in the bedroom if you have not been having any other strange experiences and you are feeling ok, this seems like a likely explanation.

Hard to say but from a mental health perspective, if something odd, difficult happens once it might be a fluke if it is happening often and causing significant distress or life impairment. Consult with a professional if you are able to identify possible treatment options.

Hi, everyone. This is my first post here, and I do not have anyone to talk to about this, so I have always been able to remember my dreams, and it is been awful. It could be about people dying me, getting tortured, kidnapped someone hurting me, or something bad happening, like loosing a limb. They also feel very real and makes me upset. When I wake up a few times, I have woke up and started bawling. I do not know why I tried not looking at my phone a few hours before bed, and different ways to relax and activities, but it does not help. Also, when I wake up, my jaw hurts sometimes as if I am clenching in my sleep. Has anyone else experienced this

I remember my dreams, too, or most of them, I guess I have often had bad dreams of me being taken to a place far away from home, loosing everyone in accidents, mostly car crashesconfusion, getting put in games like saw loosing parts of my body and so on. I still have such dreams, but they often turn out to be ok. I save people that got hurt in accidents manage to build up a new life in the new environment, etc. Confusion. I think I genuenly less attached to my dreams, even tho they seem very realistic than you are. It probably changed when I started working out caring less about the news, learning about stuff that actually interested me and relaxing more by watching the sunrise while I sit in some public transport vehicle, for exampleconfusion, I just guess that what I consume and how my life goes during the day has a big impact on my dreams.

Get rid of them. Now, this is the definition of an unhealthy relationship, and I would rather not be in it. Let me put it this way. If you are merely a punching bag for all their jokes, then they are not your friends. Why is the one a person you genuinely like to hang around? Do they make you a punching bag for their jokes? Or do they respect you as a person? Basically, it is all about respect. If people do not treat you with respect, they do not belong in your life.

I hate my friends. I remeber when we treated ourselfs with respect and dignity. And now I am early, but a punching bag for their jokes. And the worst part is that they are all I got.

If you are a teenager, try the free chat at cups. The site has an excellent reputation. It run by mental health professionals, things I often tell young people if you cannot see a therapist, self help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self help is a way to show you are serious that does not create friction in the family. In fact, it would not be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior. Self help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self help book explains what therapy for depression is like with depression. There is what seems like a catch. People say, I know there are things that will make me feel better, getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I am depressed, and I do not have the energy here. The thing very important people do have energy when they are depressed as much energy as they always do. But for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy. We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks. A famous psychiatrist, abraham low, said that when we cannot control our feelings, we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you our of bed or to the bathroom. For a shower, they will obey. Try this when it seems that you are too tired to workLie on the couch, close your eyes and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for minutes. This is a motivation trick that is been used in behavior modification programs since the if a task seems like it is too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy cleaning. Start by cleaning for, or min, and take a min break. Homework. Start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you are going to read by looking at headings, sub headings, etc. You do not have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise as little as min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually. So long as you do not make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve ilardi, the therapist researcher who headed the lifestyle depression project at the unit of kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise. If you go to metapsychology, you can read a psychologist review of do ilardi book splendid confusion of all the traditional mind body practices, meditation, etc. Confusion. The one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is yoga, breathing, slow breathing is used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder and ptsd. It safe, and it does not take any training. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition. Basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support.Also traditional asian methods it has advice specifically for depressed students always remember that there are people you can talk to like a school counselor my comments have good info for coping in a crisis including the nigh hotline

Title: Post crisis calling out from work.
Thread
To suicidal ideation, ptsd anxiety. Hi, everyone. I am struggling, knowing what to do in this situation, and I am looking for some advice. Exactly a week ago, one of my roommates, lets call her janeconfusion, expressed that she was suicidal. One of my other roommates, lizzyconfusion, sat down and talked with her about what was going on, made a safety plan and helped her get in to see a therapist today, because jane has a history of mental health issues. She is been a source of stress for us for a long time. Today, jane was admit for a hold at the hospital for her suicidality a few years ago, I walked in on someone about to attempt and had to intervene until help could come. I have ptsd from that and other traumatic issues. This has obviously taken a lot out of me. I feel so sick today, and my mental health is in the trash. I am scheduled to work a hour shift tomorrow. I explained to my boss that we have had an emergency at home, and I feel physically ill. But since I work saturdays, she is not letting me off unless I can find anyone? I am starting to revert to some warning signs for me that I am not in a good place. I have been having flashbacks, and I have been nauseous all day. Would I be a horrible person if I called out sick? I have tried asking people to cover, and everyone has said no.

Everyday, I feel as if I am not allowed to voice my concerns or opinions. If I do something wrong I get lashed at. If I try to defend myself, I am told I go too far with my wife and work. I have to just roll over and take it like a dog that is just to be discarded when it gets too old. It leaves a bad taste in my mouth and leaves me in a constant state of depression. I want to leave my job and go to another one, but my wife tells me if I quit, she is going to leave me. And I feel like I am not in control of my own life.

Title: Stimulant med dose not as effective experiencing hard adhd.
Thread
Basically just lived with adhd my entire life parents were busy professionals, and I grew up nannies. Some were immigrants, others were stay at home. Moms had problems focusing. I can remember going back to grade school. Amp was called a talented underachiever after getting in trouble. One time, I still remember parents were too busy tired to notice or do anything about it struggled throughout high school and college, hard graduated both. But getting stuff done required hyper focusing. Basically meaning I could not do anything else and getting to that point caused extreme stress and fatigue. I had vaguely heard of adhd, but thought it just meant troublemaker. Amp did not know anything beyond that. I randomly stumbled across the actual definition of adhd and the symptoms and thought, holy shit of those things resonate with me. So I saw a doc and started treatment was prescribed stimulants and omg. I finally felt in control of my life for the first time. Downside is there are side effects like not eating unless I make a point to eat. If I do I am still hungry, its a little bit hard to describe confusion, but overall, great symptom relief. Another thing I have noticed with them is that my body adjusts to the dose pretty quickly in maybe weeks. So for the last days of that window, il gradually start feeling more and more symptoms come back today is especially hard, and I am sitting here, unable to do anything except scroll. Social media sucksParticularly bad after having felt normal. Now, just a rant. No other point of saying this than to air it out. My experience with adhd is not the right way.

I question myself and I ask myself, wait, did my body get turned on by a kid? And then I panic. I have had two days in a row of crying about it. I am literally tired. Everything gotten worse.

Anxiety is so exhausting. Having intrusive thoughts is so exhausting. I hear you, and I feel you. Ive struggled with anxiety pretty much my entire life. My anxiety was the highest it is ever been during my sophomore year of high school, when I was confusion. Anxiety is a struggle. My best advice, even though it is exhausting, keep pushing and seek help, if you can. Although I was diagnosed with anxiety when I was, I truly decided that I wanted to make a change. When I was, I worked hard in therapy. I practiced exposure therapy, and more, it was hard and it was exhausting, but it was so worth it. Now, I still experience bursts of intense anxiety. But overall, my anxiety level is so much more manageable, I do things I never thought I was capable of, even though it is hard and tiring, you absolutely can do this. I believe in you

It sounds like you are experiencing intrusive thoughts. That is what the fear of being a pedophile is. Intrusive thoughts are not reflective of what you really want, and you are not alone in experiencing them. They are more common than you think. But people do not talk about them very muchconfusion. You definitely need to be seeing a therapist and maybe asking about medication. It will get better with support, but you are going to need to advocate for yourself to get the support you need. Also, in my search to find you a good video about intrusive thoughts. I found a video specifically about pedophile ocd. They are not actually pesos, just afraid they are confusion. Apparently, it is way more common than you think.

Title: My dad is emotionally unstable and its getting worse.
Thread
I am a fifteen year old female with a little sister who is twelve. We have divorced parents that became that way when I was seven, but they have managed to be pretty good about it, and we still have family nights and things akin to that. However, I have noticed some growing emotional instability in both my parents, but especially my dad. I love my dad more than words can say, and I have countless meaningful conversations with him. He is the person whose always calming everyone down in stressful situation. And of the time, he is like this. However, very few times throughout the years, he turns into someone I do not recognize. His voice raises, which is normal, but perhaps the rarity of it makes it more jarring in these moments. He is not in control. Its normally something small that tips him over the edge most of the times my little sister who I love and is kind, but is just as annoying as a twelve year old girl should be. He then sort of explodes, yells and tells us to go to our room, which is scary. But normal recently, there was an episode where my sister was complaining about going on a trip, which set him over the edge. He started yelling, throwing boxes, cursing things I had never seen him do during a time like this, I made the decision in tears, to call my mom and ask if I could go to her house, and I still rememberHim telling me, thanks, my nameconfusion thanks a fucking lot. Then coming out before we could go and telling us how he gets no fucking support from us, even though I try my best to counsel him when he is feeling off, he does not have much of a support system, and I could see how these little annoyances could build up and lead to an outbreak tonight, there was another small one in which a small thing my sister did so small I did not think it might upset him until it was too late for a second. He got visibly upset and asked us to go away and once again became someone that I did not recognize. The good thing about these episodes is that he always realizes he was in the wrong after a period of time, from minutes to hours, depending on the severity of the episode, this leads me to believe that he may have some sort of mental illness that leads to these outbreaks. He had a rough childhood loosing a parent when he was seven and having a not so great family after that, and where we live. I feel as though I am pretty much his only support system, besides my mom and her mom, who only goes so far my mom can also be sort of passive aggressive when talking to him, which is one of the little things that leads up to breakdowns like this. I am just wondering what would be the best path ofAction here to prevent further breakdowns in the future. Therapists are costly and probably to intense an option for my dad to consider. But I am afraid of what will happen if the buildup he holds within him comes out at a time where he is in a position to hurt someone he has never hurt me or my sister. But I fear that when he is not in control in these episodes, he could, any guidance anyone could offer would be greatly appreciated.

Okay please do not take this as professional advice I am not a doctor and not a counsellor all I am is an abuse survivor with that out of the way your father outburst is abusive behaviour it matters not one iota that he did not hit you or your sister it matters that he made you afraid it matters that he made your sister afraid people lose their patience and get angry all of the time but showing it like this is a sign that they will act like this again and the usual as in almost alwaysconfusion target is someone weaker than them talk to your mother about getting him to get the help that he clearly needs both of them need help if they have emotional instabilities but your father is definitely the more acute case unless there is something you are not telling us about your mother if there is a third party you can talk to a counsellor or the like talk to them too

Title: How are you supposed to go on?
Thread
Temp account for obvious reasons. I have gone through nothing but turmoil all my life. I was born to a shitty place with a horribly dysfunctional family abused and bullied by my peers, rejected and ostracized, despite my best intentions and multiple attempts of bettering myself shouldered responsibilities. I have genuinely seen grown men break under as a teenager done it without thanks or support, only emasculated, ridiculed, mocked, disrespected, unappreciated and hated. I finally broke. I have not been able to function for months. Now, the responsibility is still on my shoulder, though now it stands on a broken back. I feel like I have nothing to lean on. It feels like I could have maybe leaned on having a good social circle to cope with everything else or maybe been able to peruse my now dead passions to escape from everything else. But everywhere I look, I see horror and feel nothing but pain. At years old, not a night has gone by since I was, where I have not begged god to take me. It seems even he, in all his wisdom, has elected to abandon me too. The help of professionals is beyond me too. Due to location, economical situation, I am not looking for sympathy. If you have nothing but kind words to offer, then I kindly ask you to keep them to yourself while well intentioned and appreciated. I am looking for actual advice. How are you supposed to spend the rest of your years truly and completely broken.

A lot of people are complaining that it is hard to get therapy since the lockdown and you may want to look at online therapy and self help. What I usually tell people treatment usually begins by seeing the go, who can give you a referral? I mention referral, because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day. Any symptoms you might have, such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life affecting how you feel if you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lihelp with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also, traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this one practical advice for motivation. Very important

Title: I can feel my sanity slipping away.
Thread
So this is my confusion first post ever. Where do I begin? I wenn into therapy for a few years, and last year, I finished my last, where the told me the rest should be done in the normal world. Outside of the hospitals time went by. I felt good. I am doing my school with really good grades, but I can fiel that. I am looping touch with reality again, and it scares me I dont know what I can do about it. I mediate a lot, trying to stop smoking, working out regualy, and still, the darkness lures just around the corner. Anxiety dont know how to spell it. Sryconfusion is part of my day to day life, since a few days living in germany. In that, information is required

Title: I tried to overdose and now I cannot stop thinking about getting high.
Thread
Several weeks a couple months. Cant remember exactlyconfusion ago, I tried to overdose on a combination of different pills, painkillers, benzos, antidepressants, and alcohol and weed. I accidentally ended up just getting high for a couple hours. At least it made me feel better, though, once I felt good, I did not want to pass anymore. So I guess it worked out. Only problem is ever since then, I have been craving that high feeling very often. I really do not know what to do, any shared, similar experiences. Welcome, please, any advice. Go for it. I am on new sis, which have had me up and down, but generally not too bad. I guess I just wanted to share this ink. Thanks.

Think if you take a over dose, the chances of being found are really high. Even people found days after could be nursed back. You are far more likely to fry your brain and end up a vegetable getting high on prescription drugs is extra sketchy too. They will scramble your brain to mush the way they said. Weed does. Weed does not, but does make people lazy. But weed is easy to keep as a night time. Only thing smoked in moderation. Alittle weed and whiskey is all you will ever need or wine. And weed for the ladies,

You were feeling lousy, then you got super high, and you did not feel lousy. This is a matter of getting over the depression. Just sari is not a very good solution. Suppose you could win a prize by hitting a target with an arrow, and the arrows were free. If somebody asked, how many arrows do you want? You would not say which is the best one. Youd say, how many can I have? The beauty of self help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other and with standard treatments with office visits. While it is not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it is common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also, traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this one practical advice for motivation. Very important

Title: My therapist said, I was aloof. What does he mean?
Thread
He said he thinks I have never allowed myself to feel hurt or like I am a victim and that it can sometimes be a barrier to healing from trauma. What do you think he really meant by aloof? Usually, patients seem to have the opposite problem. Do you think I bore him? Are aloof patients boring? I do downplay a lot and have trouble feeling angry or sorry for myself and also expressing my feelings. Also, I am dealing with a lot right now and not in a great living situation, but I tend to downplay it, I think, or focus on the positives, which is kind of a waste of time for the therapy hour. Maybe that is what he meant.
Comments
I think you are worried. You bore him. You ve never allowed yourself to feel sounds like he thinks you are numbed out, not feeling emotions, and so they are not showing in your face. Common thing. I used to speak in monotone and generally look lethargic. What it turned out to be was frozen, aka fearful of showing anything real. Because I was trained early and often not to not allowed to have feelings that might take the attention away from mom. Definitely something to talk about. More. Don worry about what he thinks about you, it, your hour to express whatever you need to say

Comments
From a trauma perspective, aloof probably means a tendency of generally staying distant, maybe even wanting to keep things surface level and not a judgement of how the therapist feels about you personally, this can happen with your own feelings, experiences, as well as relationships as a protective mechanism to avoid feeling thinking really difficult and uncomfortable things. While it can be adaptive in some fashion, like facilitating functioning, day to dayconfusion, it can absolutely impact other aspects of life, like not trusting others, pushing possible close relationships, aware for fear of being let down or hurtconfusion, which are things that one can work on in therapy.

Ask him her that what they are there for. And it does not matter if your therapist finds you boring. You are not meant to entertain your therapist and you are not friends.

Please do not judge me. Does anyone else only achieve orgasm if they are thinking about things that make them sad or they are listening to emotional music I do not know what is wrong with me. I have no sex drive. I used to be a nympho, literally now I barely ever am in the mood and when I am it is only because I am feeling self destructive and when I masturbate I do not masturbate to porn or anything normal like that I just listen to sad music and think about sad shit what the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I literally getting off on my own sadness

The best thing might be getting professional help. Theres a great book, authoritative guide to self help resources for mental help, based on polls of more than professionals. The chapter on sexuality lists, books, films, and internet resources. I just checked the amazon ad and it is not expensive.

Title: Venting about my lack of intimate experience, please help me.
Thread
I am years old and I have never succesfullyconfusion had a sexual relationship I have been on antidepressants for about months now and they have helped me somewhat with social anxiety I am not nerve wrackingly nervous anymore when going outside which is a big progress for me alcohol has always helped me to lower my inhibitions with girls and I am actually pretty succesful in seducing them I can act pretty confident until it actually gets to sealing the deal. I get shy and awkward and always bail out why? Because I have not managed to stay or even get hard at any occasion. Girls are always really toxic and non understanding and that puts even more pressure on me. I mean, I get it I have managed to seduce them succesfully and now they expect sex, but then I cannot even do the most natural thing ever. Ive tried it times every time the same shit and none of the girls were particularly understanding. In fact, they shamed me for it. What makes it even more frustrating is when I really like a girl, it makes me even more nervous to perform, and I do not even escalate to the point of sexual contact I had a really big crush in is, and the only reason why we were never intimate is because of me bailing out. She gave me many chances and even directly asked me the last years I have been mainly coping with weed. I always told myself that it willGet better, etc. Now I am at the point were I really like a girl again, and my lack of experience is slowly but surely pushing her away. She is wasconfusion, really attracted to me and always wanted to see me, but now she seems uninterested due to me bailing out. The time before things got intimate. It been a long time since I have felt this bad mentally, because my biggest problems are staring me in the face again. I have managed to ignore them for long, but right now, it is not possible. Thinking about how people years younger than me are hooking up all the time and living and enjoying life is really depressing. I feel pretty old already, and in terms of intimate experience, I am just so far behind everyone. The girl I am interested now already said many times, how I am so shy, etc. I am fucking years old. I am so angry, I hate myself so much for being so inhibited and anxious. I cannot think of any way to get over this. I have already tried so many things. Amp thanks for reading.

Dude stop drinking. There are literal studies and research out there that show alcohol addiction and especially weed addiction can lead to low testosterone levels. Genetics does play a part but, aye, bro, alcohol not going to help your drive either way I recommend leaves stopdrinking as well as see a doctor to check ur nutrition levels and testosterone levels because ob something is wrong if you cannot get it up.

Title: Mental health media portrayal.
Thread
Hello, just been upset because I do not understand why people think it is alright to diagnose to characters with various neuropsychiatric conditions. I have seen this in other sub reddit, and it just makes me so frustrated there is so much misinformation perpetuated, and it just makes me feel so upset as a person with long tern neuropsychiatric conditions, not up to people without the appropriate credentials to diagnose people, let alone to characters anyone relate.

Title: Partner cheated and now they do not love themselves.
Thread
About months ago, my partner broke our agreement and went to go see somebody in another state. The action broke me very heavily, and I have been struggling with the relationship since major trust issues in an otherwise fight free relationship this morning, they told me they are having a hard time staying interested sexually due to how much they have toned down their sex drive since the events. They also noted a distinct feeling of worthlessness and self hate. They ve said repeatedly that they do not feel right about this relationship as they do not feel that they deserve me. I have made sure to make reminders that a relationship is based on a way street of respect, empathy and communication, not to mention love. But that should go without saying. I am confused on the steps we should take. I am on track to move in with this person, and they are still worrying me in multiple regards. Quick, few facts, I diagnosed ptsd, anxiety, adhd, I an artist who works from home. They are an artist, but also in cosmetology. So they do have work. I have chronic pain issues, which led to substance abuse issues years clean from, but have my struggles with more party psych drugs been clean since new years not been easy. They are on testosterone for their lifestyle. A drug that effects libido heavily. They have a therapist I am still looking for one

The fact he went so far out of his way to cheat is extremely concerning, for starters, as if he has resenting feelings towards you, as far as him feeling worthless, I would say, you need to really learn his love language and love him in the best way possible. My boyfriend always says his favorite thing about me is the way that I love him and the way I make him feel.

Title: My walls are crumbling around me.

My partner of years has told me recently that she has fallen out of love with me and wants to end the relationship. She has told me that she does not want to hurt my feelings, but she needs to do what is right for her. I am still so in love with her and feel so blindsided by this news. She wants to sell our house by the next month and just move on. In her words, I am financially not able to buy her share of the house. So the only option is to sell now I must move back to my parents house and rebuild my emotions are still so raw, and I am just so confused and hurt by it all. The future we were building now does not exist, and I am having so much trouble accepting this one had I would do anything to get her back. But on the other hand, I cannot make someone love me. The part that is going to be the worst for my healing process is that I am a barber and talk about my partner to a lot of my clients because she was important part of my life. Now it will be very awkward when I will be cutting hair and they will ask me about her, and I have to tell clients a day that we have separated, looking for, advise or some kind words

Title: I struggle with work attendance and feel terrible for
Thread
I have struggled with attendance in school and in work my whole life, most of it has to do with break downs and panic attacks or other mental health issues. I am legally disabled, but struggle to get accommodations due to the lengthy and unreliable process. I have ocd, ptsd, major depression and an unknown dissociative disorder that causes derealization and pseudo hallucinations. I am also neurodivergent with adhd, and I am working on finding out if I am autistic, I feel weak, lazy and like I make excuses, I have found myself lying in regards to responsibilities, because I know I paranoid and keep struggling to breathe is not a good sick excuse, nor is I so depressed. I am catatonic, or I having panic attacks today and cannot regulate my behavior. It sounds like whiney bullshit. In a disability sense, I do not have a lot of spoons in the day, I run out quickly and always look at the people around me who can handle it and take it. I feel like a jackass at most work places. My last job, I had a panic attack minutes in one day dissociated really bad and found myself just driving home, had to have my mom text my boss, because I was having a hard time communicating and experiencing non verbal issues. I got written up, and of course I did. I did not want to do that. I did not want to leave that same job. I suddenly quit without notice, which I hadNever done before, because I just kept getting panic attacks at that same job. I consistently had to sit and rest to calm down. But instead, it looked like I was being lazy and doing nothing. I just do not know what to think of myself. I look at other people who have much more stressful lives than me, and they can work twice as much as I do and handle it. Fine. I know how people talk about coworkers who have behaviors like mine, and I am riddled with embarrassment. I do not know how to do better. Work stresses me out so much like it makes my mental health plummet. If I were lucky enough to work a job, I like maybe that would not happen. But regardless, it is difficult, and I feel like an asshole.

This is sort of a vent post and a question. So forgive if it runs a bit long. Last night, I began to feel nauseous. I took some pepto bismol and did my best to ignore it as much as I can might, I add. Unfortunately, however, due to my slight emtophobia, nausea makes me anxious, which in turn makes me more nauseous. My question is, how the hell do I stop being so anxious? I also kind of know why I am nauseous. I have not eaten in a bit, but I am currently thinking on what I should eat

Title: Is mental health an emergency.
Thread
So here is my little story. I think I suffer from depression, anxiety and adhd but never been diagnosed. So because I never saw a therapist or psychologist, I have been short of money for months because I stopped working in october, so could not really see any doctor. I managed to gather some money and was finally able to call for an appointment with my family doctor so he could lead me to a therapist. This way, I will not have to pay, has much as I would have for a therapist. I was so happy I have been waiting for month to see a therapist. I just want the pain to stop. But when I called to make an appointment, the secretary asked me what was the purpose of the appointment? And I told her that I would like to keep that between the doctor and myself. After that, she told me that my case was not an emergency and that I would have to wait for a month to have an appointment. I usually have to wait for at most or days. It just does not make sense to me. I just want to heal. I know one month is not much of a big deal, but I have been waiting for months to be able to see a therapist, and it is just making it worse now that I have to wait another month. If I call back and tell her that is it is for mental health issue, would she considerGiving me an appointment sooner.

I am sorry to hear you are going through this and understand how frustrating it can be to navigate mental health services. I am not sure how your doctor prioritizes concerns, but I personally found that my daughters general practitioner had clear guidelines for what constitutes an emergency regarding mental health. And I was required to give vague information on the nature of our needs. In order to see the doctor, I would definitely try calling back and stating, you are calling, with concerns to your mental health and are seeking help. Also keep in mind that when calling a mental health clinic catering to others with mental illness, they will ask for a vague explanation as to the nature of your needs. It is essentially a triage assessment of need, and they cannot accurately gauge where in the line you fall without some basic information on your needs at the time

If I call back and tell her that is it is for mental health issue. Would she consider giving me an appointment sooner? Maybe you can be broad and say it is for depression and anxiety. The clinic might use this info to pair you with somebody who can provide proper treatment. Remember, everybody else at this clinic is also there for some type of mental health reason. So you are not alone, and that receptionist is literally communicating with everybody. Last, there are therapist shortages everywhere, so you may still need to wait a month. Its possible that if somebody was in crisis like suicidalconfusion, they can be seen earlier and triaged. Eg whether to hospitalizeconfusion. Good luck.

Title: Is there anything over the counter my husband can take to help with a manic episode until he is seen by a doctor.
Thread
Hi. I actually posted in here yesterday, but I believe my husband is having his first manic episode. He has not been diagnosed with anything besides depression and adhd so far, but his mom has bipolar, and it is clear this is an episode that has gone on for about a week, maybe a bit longer. What do I do? I feel helpless and so anxious that he is going to make a bad decision while in this state of mind. At this point, he is not a risk to himself or others. And as it is, the weekend, I feel we are just stuck waiting for a response. I sent a message to his doctor and therapist, but doubt I will get a response until monday. Can anyone give me advice on what to do? In my post yesterday, someone informed me what hypomania is, and that is describing him to a tee. He is going a million miles an hour and is the happiest he has ever felt in his life. Is there something that can maybe help him sleep that will not make this worse.

Psych nurse here do your best to make sure he is eating finger foods or smoothies. Shakes work best since people experiencing mania have a hard time sitting still, most likely he will not or has not been sleeping much so encouraging. Rest will be important even if he does not listenconfusion. Sadly, unless you have the appropriate prescription meds to help bring him down a little, you got to ride the wave if it gets to a point of concern over safety. Hospitalization is an option for mania as well. Hope this helped a little

It sounds like what you are talking about is what they call magnification, making mountains out of molehills it. What people who have trouble with anxiety tend to do in case you are worried about this, I will give you some suicide prevention advice. First, I will give you some anxiety advice. When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently, seconds each. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem. Instead of just worrying about it, think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. When you use the thinking brain, you get control of the emotional brain, and you feel better. Also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts, count your blessings, and remind yourself of your successes. The treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy, and medication don overlook stress management. It can help even with very bad anxiety. I have more info about mood disorders in my comments, andYou are welcome to click on my name and read the thing about suicidal thoughts is do not get involved in them. If one occurs to you, just let it go. That slow breathing is very useful in a moment of crisis when you are very upset. Actually, the more you practice that breathing rate during the day, the better this video is part of a series for suicide.

I wish I could be more helpful. The best I can do is offer advice for panic attacks and stress. Panic disorder often responds to self help. I have advice from experts in my recent comments when you are worrying you are not really thinking you re just spinning your wheels. When you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent don make mountains out of molehills. One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits, a really simple but effective thing, the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath. The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It used in treating anxiety, depression and ptsd. Video the stanford ptsd studyconfusion soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing rushing around when you do not have to. And doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness. Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for yourPeace of mind you can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners videos on youtube.

It got old when I found purpose in my life and set goals for my future. I will still occasionally go out but will not stay until the early hours and stop after a couple of drinks. I find that I can still have a lot of fun if I sip non alcoholic beverages throughout the night or alternate between alcoholic and non alcoholic. That way I still have fun. And the next day I can be productive instead of staying in bed all day and ordering pizza.

It got old before I even did it. I saw how people act when they do that. I didnt want to be like them. You can always go somewhere to hang out. You could go to clubs without getting face, just drink water or soda instead alcohol.

Title: Fighting with myself about seeking professional help about my mental health.
Thread
So I would say my whole life, I have struggled with anxiety in some form. An example of this was me developing a severe eating disorder as a child, because I had a fear of puking and also choking. I got over this on my own. After a year present day, I would say, for the few years, I have really struggled overall with my mental health. Most of this is stemming from my job. My job pretty much gives me bad anxiety and stress and is starting to take a toll on me. I constantly think about work. I am bitter, always sore, tired, stressed, and I get home and have zero motivation. Me simply trying to find the will to even do something as simple as watch. A movie takes a lot out of me. I also have a lot of brain fog lately. I have been coming home from work and just sobbing. I have not felt truly happy in. God knows how long just knowing that I am going to go to a place that evokes such negative emotions and feelings out of me makes it hard for me to find joy in anything I am getting married in less than months, and my house will be finished, being built anytime now, and I cannot even be excited about it because the negative emotions overshadow it all. I am stuck at this job for now, until my fiance makes more money for us to be able to afford the cost of livingI am in management at a retail chain, and it pays extremely well for the area I am in, because this is temporary. I am debating on seeking medical help. I have been fighting with myself about it because I am afraid that I will appear to whiny or they will not take me seriously. And I am also afraid of being put on any medication due to a fear of the side effects. But I am also literally going insane. Any insight or advice would be helpful.

Definitely seek out professional help before things get worse even if you know youl leave this job soon if you are prescribed a medication, there is nothing legally requiring you to fill the script and take the pills or if you start and experience side effects, you can work with your doctor to discontinue and of course, there are non medication options like therapy to help with stress and anxiety management. If you are in the us and have worked for year, you may qualify for mla to attend appointments if you are having trouble getting time off. Eg if you begin regular therapyconfusion

Title: To mention of suicideconfusion my best friend.
Thread
Hi guys. A few months ago, my confusion, best friend, confusion, committed suicide. I have went for a few counseling services, but felt that it was not helping. We were really close, worked together, studied together, went out together and practically did everything together. Her absence is haunting, and it seems like all my friends are moving on, but I cant. Sometimes therel be overwhelming feelings of sadness, hate, disgust, anger, envy of others bestiesconfusion. And it really sucks. These feelings come in waves when I am reminded of her, like when I saw her favourite shoes or when I went to places we used to. Frequent isolation from my other friends school work and loneliness, low self esteem, paranoia and fear of further loss really does not help. I feel like I have died together with her, and nothing in my life is the same anymore. I miss her so much, and I miss that part of my life when I was with her, I do not know what to do. All I want is to see her again, to never lose anyone I care about again. But I know that those are impossible. I do not have suicidal thoughts

Title: I joined a functional medicine program and now I may have an eating disorder.
Thread
I recently joined a functional medicine program that promised relief from symptoms like anxiety and depression to only restrict my diet and make me have bad relationship with food. I want to eat whatever I want. But I am mentally unable to remove the conditioning from my psyche. It has affected my life as well. My relationships with my wife, we still love each other, but she is so stressed out by it that she is losing her hair. For me, telling people that certain foods are bad for you, while possibly true, sure to their inflammatory characteristics, the fact of the matter is some people do not eat at all. I see all the logic of not doing it but feeling mentally conditioned. I feel that the separation of myself from the program is quite difficult and needing to work up the courage to make the change, because I am worried about my overall health. I have lost a healthy amount of weight, which is probably ideal for most. But now for me, the weight comes at a loss of strength as well.
Comments
Would it be recommended that I seek mental health services? Is it wrong to put the blame on myself for making such a terrible decision?

I want to eat whatever I want but I am mentally unable to remove the conditioning from my psyche are you still enrolled step would be to unenroll stop paying, stop attending etcconfusion step would be to try to re integrate your previous eating habits with some select pointers from the program make a daily plan goal with eating start to work on re reconditioning how you think about food maybe avoid certain really specific categories of foods that are bad for health but do not over restrict

Title: Any tips on how to combat impulse to self harm
Thread
Hello, everyone. I am an average dude in his with an average life. However, recently, I have started suspecting that I have bad, due to some of by best friends ever, abandoning me after calling me out on my anger issues that were present, but became even more noticeable after this happenetongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. I have met a girl who pretended she liked me, only to basically ditch me for her ex without dumping meconfusion, causing me to literally send desesperate messages of threatening self harm, lying, saying, I self harmed, saying, I hate her saying, I love her, talking to myself, pretending I am people all in hours after she fell asleep. No need to say I fell pathetic, right after I was never someone who was invested into relationships and literally never got into one of my own choice, because I cannot relate to most womenconfusion, but I was ready to get into one for her, though. I consider myself to be very concise and level headed, just angry, occasionally. But this made me realize how fearful I am of rejection, where I am quite literally ready to lie and hurt myself. If it means the person stays a bit longer, it is not something I control, I got very emotional. Now, here I am. Ive lost of my best friends ever due to my explosive anger at the slightest slight, and I have lost. The only girl I have ever liked that much because of her ex.Right now, I am coping through drinking and smoking, but I feel terrible, and I am having impulses to hurt myself that I am trying to suppress. I ve never done it, but as I grew up, I developed an impulse to do it. When I get emotional, I usually just punch my legs until it hurts really badconfusion. I am simply asking you guys, if you got any advice on how to suppress these thoughts and all the negative emotions building up inside of me in, I literally had like mental breakdowns from just how emotional I got is no, unfortunately, I cannot pay for a psychiatrist, let alone therapy. I am literally a broke college student. I will have to tank it for a long while until I can get help

Hey, thanks for posting and reaching out. I am not a regular of this community, and you just came by on my reddit feed. I do not have specific advice for you except this do not take advice from strangers. On reddit it is impossible to know your situation and mindspace through text, without being familiar with your history, your life, your connections, etc. I recommend talking to someone in real life who is close to you, and if it is hard to think of anybody to contact your college and ask for their health services, many educational institutes have professionals who can help students through tough times and find the right support group. I can relate to your desire to self harm. One pain can drown out the other. I hope you realise that this one pain will lead to more, and the way out of pain is to endure it and still do the right thing. Hurting yourself now will form the habit of self harm, and its a loop that is hard to get out of, best of luck and a hug from the other side of the world

So yesterday I was watching dead meat on youtube about movie kill counts then after the video ends, I got recommend by youtube to a video called brutality of a serbian film confusion its big wills video I think you need to watch it to understand me but I strongly advise not to do it or you end up like me too I clicked on. It was summarize video about a horror movie which its known by how gruesome it is now I can handle gruesome movies like saw but I didnt expect how its going to be gruesome and far too disturbing. It was especially that scene this scene im talking about traumatized and ruined me for the past couple of days. I lose my appetite quickly having a very difficult time eating and I cannot sleep. I need to forget it. I cannot concentrate. Im having anxiety I cant masturbate. Im a teenager, so I do it very often while doing it. This scene suddenly just comes up to my mind, and my whole body just stopped for a moment, and I get very nauseated and disgusted about myself, I ended up vomiting all over my bed. I scrolled through reddit searching for a way how to forget things, but it just does not work for me. Sometimes I just punch myself in the head. Everytime I think of it, im so sorry if this does not make any sense to you. I just really ned to get this thing out of my chest.And especially my head. I got a periodical exam tomorrow that I studied so much for, and I just cannot sleep or get this thing out of my head.

Title: Is there anything over the counter my husband can take to help with a manic episode until he is seen by a doctor.
Thread
Hi. I actually posted in here yesterday, but I believe my husband is having his first manic episode. He has not been diagnosed with anything besides depression and adhd so far, but his mom has bipolar, and it is clear this is an episode that has gone on for about a week, maybe a bit longer. What do I do? I feel helpless and so anxious that he is going to make a bad decision while in this state of mind. At this point, he is not a risk to himself or others. And as it is, the weekend, I feel we are just stuck waiting for a response. I sent a message to his doctor and therapist, but doubt I will get a response until monday. Can anyone give me advice on what to do? In my post yesterday, someone informed me what hypomania is, and that is describing him to a tee. He is going a million miles an hour and is the happiest he has ever felt in his life. Is there something that can maybe help him sleep that will not make this worse.

Im sorry to hear that really nobody deserves to be alone. It is like a poison, at least for me. But yeah, this are tough times. I wish I could give all the awnsers, but I barely help myself everyday. You are not alone. There is always help or someone to talk to is not there like a counselor in your college or something there is got to be someone who you can talk to it better to try to do something than just stay the same.

Title: Medication advice.
Thread
I have been struggling with my mental health ever since I was little, but I never treated it cause my mother was scared of medicating me. Fast forward to today, I finally found a psychiatrist I like, have been diagnosed with depression, anxiety ptsd and bipolar disorder since I have never taken anything they want to ease me in with zoloft. First, however, I am a stay at home, parent of, and my partner is concerned of how ill react to the medication doesn want me to take itconfusion. What are your experiences? If any with zoloft should I listen to them?
Comments
I was on zoloft for about two years. It was the first med I was ever put on for depression and anxietyconfusion. And I had a lot of similar concerns when I was starting medication, because I tend to be very sensitive to meds, I really did not notice any significant side effects, maybe a slight headache for a few days. At first, I do not think there is any need for you to worry about it. I understand why your partner is worried, but they should try to keep in mind that the medication is meant to help you, and was given to you by a medical professional for a reason.

Title: Dealing with fear of war.
Thread
Hi there. New here. The recent events, news concerning a very possible war in country where I am from making me constantly stressed out. I check regularly the news. It worries me a lot if there are no updates, and of course even more when it there are. I do not live there anymore, but my family does. And if something happens, they want to stay there to help the way possible. So this whole situation just drives me insane, brought my anxiety attacks back and made me clearly unproductive at my job. I am sadly still on the wait list for therapy. So I thought maybe some of you here could give me some advices how to deal with this kind of stress

Title: Is imagining a very happy life in the future which I do not haveconfusion a form of mental illness
Thread
I just had a moment of realization that my good mental health is built upon imagination. I imagine things that are not true, like having a happy family partner, daughter, etc. And being extremely wealthy. I am doing much better compared to my mental states a year ago, when I was jobless. However, when the realization hits me, I feel devastated and react by ignorance. I really wish I had everything I imagined, but I don. I do not want to feel depressed about it either. So I enjoy the imagination. Can this be counterproductive? Could this turn into a mental illness? At what point would it turn into maladaptive, daydreaming?
Comments
I do not really have any advice but I do the same thing because I have a hard time accepting reality I would say it might become a problem if it keeps you from working and putting effort into your real life or if it makes it hard for you to focus on things

Title: Surreal realisation that I am alive.
Thread
Every so often I will just have a very intense feeling of being alive, but not in a way that reminds me I am present. Its less mindful than that. I would associate it more. So with a surreal, unpleasant feeling, like I am overly aware of my own presence, I have noticed it happens more frequently if I am not in a good place, and it can take me a few hours to feel normal after it. I was wondering if other people have had similar experiences when I talk about it to people I know in my real life, a lot of times, they look alarmed at what I am describing, and I am yet to talk to anyone about it who has experienced the same thing

Title: Feeling detached, spacey and numbany suggestions.
Thread
Hi, all. I have been struggling with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember, and despite countless therapy sessions, meditation, diet changes and supplements, I am still feeling off. I have dealt with brain fog and fatigue for years without consciously recognizing it. On days where I do not have brain fog, I feel extremely anxious and hyper vigilant. This has impacted my academic career, and I have been stuck with decision paralysis ever since graduating. Last year, I spoke to my therapist, psychiatrist about this, and was prescribed atomoxetine for mild adhd, but noticed that I was feeling very fatigued after taking the medicationto the point in which I had to take naps daily. I then quit atomoxetine for this reason and started wellbutrin, which has definitely helped with my mood and motivation. The only issue is that my change in behavior has triggered my social anxiety as I am networking and having job interviews to help with this, I have been taking my of propranolol, sometimes only halfconfusion, to manage my social anxiety. Although propranolol has worked great for controlling my physical symptoms, I have noticed that I have been feeling very spaced out and lightheaded at times, almost detached from reality. My doctor mentioned that lightheadedness is not very common as side effects, so I am not sure if it is from the medication I would like to know if I should stop taking propranolol or lower the dosage. As I have noticed, my cognition is not as sharp asIt once was I am still struggling with concentration, active listening and completing activities that require mental effort, such as arithmetic. There are times where I stare directly into space with a blank mind, and I am not sure whether it is abnormal or a coping mechanism to distract myself from anxiety. This has happened several times in the past, where I would freeze up when answering a question and avoid it all together. I would like to know what are the best remedies to stay present and alert to, focus on the moment.

Title: Any opinion plus on way to doctor.
Thread
So for years now I have struggled with depression and the thinking of the past I have not been truly happy in years and I have smoked a ridiculous amount of weed to try fix it now when I do it means nothing I do not even get stoned anymore I fear being sober tho I finally found someone who brought me true joy and I did not need anything but to be with her to be happy nothing else mattered was with a girl months she was amazing every aspect everything I ever wanted and we were the same person got on perfect in every way she inspired me and wed so much planned for the future going ahead years she always said how I was the most important person in her life and how it killed her when we fought I had planned far ahead and so has she I have plans for a house and her dad was a project planner able to help me build a house in the next few years over in italy where she is from this has always been my dream I have always looked for happiness in money but finally realised relationships are more important she inspired me to work as hard as possible so I could give her everything I was worried she was doing me dirty and had to cut her off but now it is the biggest mistake of my life and when I look into the future I see nothing I have alreadyBeen extremely depressed about my past, and now I am past my breaking point. My family wants me to go to the doctors right now but to get help, but honestly, I dont want help anymore. I just want to die. When we very started talking, we had a big fight because of a guy. She said, he is tried it with her for years, says, she hates it. And when I said, how is he at it so long then she freaked out, saying, she is never had a thing with him before and never replies. A month later, she told me he texted her again. I said, I would deal with it. She said, no and that she was going to block him. I said, ok, no problem. A week later, she tells me he is text her again, even tho, he is meant to be blocked. I say nothing and ask to see what he said. She avoids it, saying, she is blocked him actually, this time, so cannot show me. Then shows me what he said, only showing some of it tho and she was replying. So again, did not block him. I gave out and she said shel deal with it herself next time and say nothing next day apologises and says, how she is so sorry and will make it up to me since that day. I never heard anything. My ex has been at me years, but I have never wanted any of it truthfully, and she knew thatShe made me block mine on everything because we ended on bad terms. Her ex texted her same day and said, whassup! I said he probably knows about us and she said, yes, he is done it before to try get back with me. I told her to block him aswell because of that. And she said, she is not end of she does not need to because they finished on good terms. The occasional time she would bring him up and talk good about him for example, I would show a watch I wanted to get. And she said how he has a red rolex and showed me shed show me his private story and say how his mam still get her christmas present. Nal odd time he would send me a video of a to show she watched and it would be a half cast guy captured sexy. Her ex is half cast. Last week, she was at her cousins party and said she was going home at. I woke up at half next day, and it said she was last at the party location at I asked when she got home and she replied at ten, saying, she got home at and fell asleep straight away and to take her word over maps told her that is odd and she freaked, resulting in us splitting up. Now a day after we split up, she is onto that exact ex I have been talking about do you think she was gaslighting and I madeThe right move I understand theres no hard evidence and could be worse I just want to know do you agree these were and I was better off to end things early because I had a gut feeling and was certain but now ink if I made a big mistake twink or smirk I ended with the girl of my dreams who changed my life for the better in every way cause I feared red flags and did not want to get hurt more in the future ive always seen it as I am better off making money now then a woman rather than the other way buy now I am at an all time low thinking I made the biggest mistake of my life and I cannot get over it. The only outcome I can think of is suicide. I am on my way to hospital to see what doctor but now I see it as its too late and I do not want help. Triangular flag

Title: Is this normal or concerned?
Thread
This has happened maybe like times already, like every months or so, I wake up in the middle of the night or really early in the morning by my alarm. And then suddenly I literally cant control my thoughts anymore. I know we all have a voice in our head, which is completly normal. But when this strange thing happens, I feel like I loose control over my inner voice and my thoughts. It feels like everything got mixed up in my head, and my inner voice just got into the background, and something bigger took over me. I normally get extreme anxiety and start to shake, even cried twice when it happened after, like, minutes with seriously trying to get the control back. Its away. Like nothing happened. I always try to think about normal things, like what I did that day and control my breath, which kind of works sometimes, but mostly I just have to wait or wish I will just fall asleep. I have a history of schizophrenia in my family, my uncleconfusion, but I dont know if this might be connected. He killed himself years ago, and his symptoms were much different. Is this something normal? Like everybody has experienced? I tried researching about it on the interest, but I havent really found anything that explains what I am feeling. Im sorry about all the grammar errors or misused words. Im just too nervous right now.

I personally have not experienced it, and it may not be common enough or pathological enough to be classified as a physical health or mental health problem. But trying to breath and fall back asleep is a good solution. I have a history of schizophrenia in my family, my uncleconfusion, but I dont know if this might be connected. Given that this feels more like in the anxiety type domain, I do not think it is representative of anything else. Also more immediate family, like birth parents, siblingconfusion or a whole bunch of uncles and nephews would be more concerning for genetic predisposition. Honestly, the best thing to do would be to trying to live a balanced life and avoid drugs as drug induced psychosis is very real, and research shows that earlier abuse of substances can sometimes be linked to later development of disorders like schizophrenia. Up for debate, whether if it is more cause or more correlationconfusion,

First of all, I am so incredibly sorry you are going through this, and so incredibly proud that you have made it through so far. Are there any charities or authorities that you could report your father to or that could offer you your mother and your siblings advice relating to the schoolwork side of things it is no wonder you are finding it harder given everything you are going through. So if you feel any guilt, please try to forgive yourself because it is absolutely not your fault with schoolwork. It is important to remember that school systems are, unfortunately only set up to cater to certain individuals who thrive during exams, but the real world is not like that, and you will be able to explore your passions and learn in a way that helps you. And once you are out of the school environment, you will not look back. Sorry for focusing more on the schoolwork side of things. I am hoping that plenty of people far more knowledgeable than me who can help with the abuse you are experiencing. I know you do not see your future shining anymore, but just from the few paragraphs you have written, I can tell you are smart, brave, strong and much more, it hard to imagine a scenario in which your future is not shining because you show so many amazing qualities the world is lucky to have you in it. And I really hope life feels brighter for you soon, and you get theLife you completely and utterly deserve.

Within the last decade, I had tough summers. One of them was filled with almost every struggle, family fights, potential legal battles, heavy restrictions on technology being switched institutions, etc. It was right after I left a mediocre at best summer camp, and was going to another. Soon. The current location was a peaceful airbnb house in new jersey, owned by a gay couple. Although I was there with others, I felt I had no one there for me. There were very few ways to express my grievances and no one would listen. My primary response would be to hit stuff and shout, but I decided not to. The house was old fashioned and very nice. It had many amenities. I had not known the owners, but they seemed like great people. If I damaged anything, it would have strained our temporary relationship. This only comes to mind because I began engaging in old, harmful habits again. However, this memory gives me hope for when my mind overcomes my impulses

Title: Currently in a ward and need an opinion.
Thread
So for years now I have struggled with depression and the thinking of the past I have not been truly happy in years and I have smoked a ridiculous amount of weed to try fix it now when I do it means nothing I do not even get stoned anymore I fear being sober tho I finally found someone who brought me true joy and I did not need anything but to be with her to be happy nothing else mattered was with a girl months she was amazing every aspect everything I ever wanted and we were the same person got on perfect in every way she inspired me and wed so much planned for the future going ahead years she always said how I was the most important person in her life and how it killed her when we fought I had planned far ahead and so has she I have plans for a house and her dad was a project planner able to help me build a house in the next few years over in italy where she is from this has always been my dream I have always looked for happiness in money but finally realised relationships are more important she inspired me to work as hard as possible so I could give her everything I was worried she was doing me dirty and had to cut her off but now it is the biggest mistake of my life and when I look into the future I see nothing I have alreadyBeen extremely depressed about my past, and now I am past my breaking point. My family wants me to go to the doctors right now but to get help, but honestly, I dont want help anymore. I just want to die. When we very started talking, we had a big fight because of a guy. She said, he is tried it with her for years, says, she hates it. And when I said, how is he at it so long then she freaked out, saying, she is never had a thing with him before and never replies. A month later, she told me he texted her again. I said, I would deal with it. She said, no and that she was going to block him. I said, ok, no problem. A week later, she tells me he is text her again, even tho, he is meant to be blocked. I say nothing and ask to see what he said. She avoids it, saying, she is blocked him actually, this time, so cannot show me. Then shows me what he said, only showing some of it tho and she was replying. So again, did not block him. I gave out and she said shel deal with it herself next time and say nothing next day apologises and says, how she is so sorry and will make it up to me since that day. I never heard anything. My ex has been at me years, but I have never wanted any of it truthfully, and she knew thatShe made me block mine on everything because we ended on bad terms. Her ex texted her same day and said, whassup! I said he probably knows about us and she said, yes, he is done it before to try get back with me. I told her to block him aswell because of that. And she said, she is not end of she does not need to because they finished on good terms. The occasional time she would bring him up and talk good about him for example, I would show a watch I wanted to get. And she said how he has a red rolex and showed me shed show me his private story and say how his mam still get her christmas present. Nal odd time he would send me a video of a to show she watched and it would be a half cast guy captured sexy. Her ex is half cast. Last week, she was at her cousins party and said she was going home at. I woke up at half next day, and it said she was last at the party location at I asked when she got home and she replied at ten, saying, she got home at and fell asleep straight away and to take her word over maps told her that is odd and she freaked, resulting in us splitting up. Now a day after we split up, she is onto that exact ex I have been talking about do you think she was gaslighting and I madeThe right move I understand theres no hard evidence and could be worse I just want to know do you agree these were and I was better off to end things early because I had a gut feeling and was certain but now ink if I made a big mistake twink or smirk I ended with the girl of my dreams who changed my life for the better in every way cause I feared red flags and did not want to get hurt more in the future ive always seen it as I am better off making money now then a woman rather than the other way buy now I am at an all time low thinking I made the biggest mistake of my life and I cannot get over it. The only outcome I can think of is suicide. I am on my way to hospital to see what doctor but now I see it as its too late and I do not want help. Triangular flag

I do not think there is anything wrong with you. Highschool is brutal. That is the just of it. Highschool sucks. If you do not have any friends heading into highschool, you will have a difficult time making friends. Alternatively, you can try to make friends just like how people need to come up to, you need to go up to them in order to become friends. Try that, and you might have a better chance.

Comments
It does not seem all that strange to me, but perhaps there is a lot more emotionally dead people than we thought. I have a large, extended family, and some I have never met before, but my parents are close to the fact you feel bad for your mom and feel upset for her seems to prove you do have empathy and emotional capacity for you. It is no different than seeing a random obit in the paper of someone you have never met. It just means you do not have any emotional connection to this person. In my honest, humble opinion, you are perfectly fine and nothing to be concerned about.

Title: Is it wrong to become a new person and kill old self?
Thread
I have had severe issues in childhood and did some pretty bad sick, twisted stuff never directly hurt anyoneconfusion and tried to move on. But the guilt is killing me. Still, this horrendous stuff has lead to anxiety and ocd, and feeling the universe will punish me. On the other side, I feel like I decided to remake myself not into perfect, but to be a good person. And I suppose to make it I always thought I would suffer my whole life and be a monster, and maybe I will. But now I found someone. The guilt of my childhood is coming back, and I feel I cant be happy. Part of me is saying, and signs from the universe is saying, I need to accept and become that person again, and what I did, but I always have accepted it. But I guess I dissociated with this previous self, and I killed that version in my brain, but I feel im getting signs. The person I found will be taken away because I dont deserve any hapiness. If I dont accept and become this person. However, this new person I ve become. I like I have become a better person and want to leave the old self of me dead. But my mind wont let me, and the fear of anything bad happening is killing me. I can accept, but I feel I dont deserve her. If I do accept myself as this bad person again, to be clear, I understand I did theseThings and have repented and learned from them. I just have this other self where I feel like im not that person anymore, but the universe wants to squeeze out me. The stuff I did was sick, twisted stuff. As a child, mostly done out of stupidity, I will say it involved peeing on siblings and stupid things like that. But I realize we all do stupid shit as kids, and some of it is disgusting, and I came from emotionally abusive household and all that, but still doesnt shake this uneasy feeling.

Comments
A massive amount of individuals take some type of antidepressant, literally tens of millions in the us aloneconfusion, so they are extremely safe. If you experience side effects, some will be very temporary and usually resolve itself within days or weeks of starting, and your doc will monitor things during followup acts. If side effects are prominent, you can easily and safely be switched over to a different med.

My sense of love has become fucked up. Over the years, I have been broken, and my ideals have kind of fallen apart. But somewhere in that process, without noticing, I developed a fucked up sense of what love is like. Now, I am stuck believing that someone needs to hurt, abuse me, for our relationship to be considered love equally. I believe that unless I am hurtful, I cannot find anyone who loves me. I have only recently realized this, and I am so scared by the implications I really need someone to talk to about this. I have no one in my life I can talk to about mental health.

To be truthful, I wrote the below paragraph while high marijuanaconfusion. I am sober. Now, I compartmentalize all these different parts of myself, not myself in any one setting. For example, I am not myself in front of my therapist because I want her to like me. I do not completely let go during sex, because I am still self conscious, etc. For context, I have been with my partner almost years, and we have a child together. I should bring this up in therapy. I should also talk to my partner about it more. I know this, but I am just like delaying it and hiding from it. I am super insecure deep down, but project out that I am not. When I really hone in on my fears, I realize I have this underlying fear that people in my life do not actually like me, not my partner or very best friend, but others coworkers, other friends. I feel like none of this is new info. I have just been too afraid to admit any of it to myself, because then I would have to act on it, and that is too scary to consider doing overthink.

Title: How to deal with constant jealousy, confusion.
Thread
Ok I know this is really weird but for as long as I have been able to think I have had extreme jealousy regarding travelling specifically when I was younger if I found out someone had or was going to travel abroad I would cry for ages out of some kind of extreme jealousy, I am able to manage the physical response now but I still feel exactly the same emotionally right now one of my friends is on a plane headed for a holiday and I am having extremely destructive thoughts I know how ridiculous it is but my mind keeps telling me how unfair it is they can travel but I can and how I will never be able to leave britain cause I will never have the money. This happens even when my friends bring up a vague possibility of them travelling its like my mind takes any excuse to spiral into an abyss of travel themed self loathing even the fact that I have been abroad twice has not helped. I know this sounds crazy and I do not feel like this about anything else, but I just want it to end

Jealousy only gets worse as you age up as purchase and trips get more lavish as people incomes go up. I have a hard time dealing with this as well, and it affects many relationships. You need to come to your own realization that a person worth is not based on their trips and items, but who they are deep inside. You have to do this yourself and figure out how to make the you inside yourself. Listen, I am sorry you are feeling this. I wish that this feeling was not so strong that it affects my life either.

Title: How do I keep trying?
Thread
Until the lockdowns started, I used to be driven and motivated to achieve goals I would set for myself and even to do schoolwork. Amp assignments. I confusion. I used to have a productive schedule, good sleep pattern, etc. Life was pretty good. And then almost two years ago, it all started falling apart. At first I started having those periods of high productivity and energy. Amp the exact opposite. Alternatively, it later turned out it was depression. I know it sounds like bad, but I have not been diagnosed with itconfusion. So essentially, I would get my life back together, create routines, habits for it all to fall apart over and over again. And now, for the last six months, I have just been a wreck of my past self every now and again. A thought crosses my mind to improve in some aspect or to start working towards something. But I immediately shut it down, because deep down, I know how it is going to end, not only that, but how I feel about things strongly depends on my mood, which is about as consistent as damn. That is a smooth transition. I go to therapy for depression and anxiety, but apart from venting, it has not done pretty much anything. For me, I do not know if I had wrong expectations. I certainly do not expect it to fix me all by itself, but I simply have not been presented with any options. All I have gotten is fairly common sense advice thatDoes not offer any new perspective. Also, no meds have worked. Sometimes I feel like I need a reality check but do I really I am aware of my situation but I feel like I have run out of options and I am just hopeless at this point if I ever hoped for it to get better all by itself, it is now I would do a tldr, but this already is about as concise as I could make.

First off. I am so sorry that you are going through all of this. I am also and felt really similarly. I honestly think one thing that you really need to think about is that you do not really know that things are going to keep repeating themselves over and over again. It feels like a loop have a spiralling period, where everything is unravelling, get stuck in the low point, trying to claw out, eventually start climbing out, only to fall into the spiral again. I believe the first and foremost issue is our belief that we will keep falling back in. If we tell ourselves something will happen to us, we are more likely going to inadvertently prepare for it and encourage it to happen. If we tell ourselves that we can take small, gradual steps to get out of it, then it is way more likely to happen. You cannot sprint up a steep hill, but you can slowly and methodically climb up it. So I suggest starting with little things and working on sustaining them before trying to repair the next thing. Aim for one target. At a time. For example, I hit my low point just before I got out of my relationship with my ex, my first target was breaking up because it was best for both of us. Then I moved on to trying to repair the next thing. I decided to make each of the next targets a specific friendship that I needed to reinforce, because I gotReally absent from my friends, trying to fix everything at once makes it more likely that it will fall apart because you are focused on way too much at once aim for one thing at a time. Maybe it is making sure you are keeping your room clean or eating a healthy amount or strengthening one friendship at a time. These were all things I struggled with. I hope this helps. I will be praying for you, and please remember that I am here for you. If you need someone to talk to, things are going to get better. Red heart

Okay, so you say that things in your life tend to correlate with your mood. I, if you are feeling down, your life goes down the toilet, and if you are feeling better, your life improves. I think you may benefit from raising your logical rational side and lowering your emotional sensitive side. For example, if you have a bad day at work that leaves you feeling like shit, the emotional sensitive response is to give up and quit. But the logical rational side is to recognize that you need a job, you like what you do. And the bad days come and go, and generally, the days are pretty alright. Even good. If you are feeling crappy. The emotional, sensitive response is to just give up and quit. But the logical, rational response is to recognize. Okay, I am feeling crappy. That means I need more structure, care and routine, not less. This might mean doing things that feel faux and forced and like you are fucking faking it sometimes, even if you are not hungry, it might mean eating two eggs for breakfast. Sure, you are not hungry, and they sorta taste like rubbery cardboard, but the appetite and taste is not relevant. You needing regular nourishment in order to function and live is what is relevant that logical and rational. So do not ignore your emotions. Just relegate. Work to relegate them to a realm of stuff that is not the be all end all

Title: I feel disconnected from my life.
Thread
I graduated when the pandemic hit us all. I already had a job in hand when I finished my cog. I joined the firm from online mode, only, and I have been stuck at my hometown since, as im wah, I want to do something else than the job that I have. I have joined some tuition for that first months were great. I was able to manage my work and studying parallel. Some day I missed the schedule. And since then, it is been hell. I constantly procrastinate things. I feel whole day in my room. I just feel I am on autopilot whole day, and when I get into bed at the end of the day, I feel guilty. I do not understand where my day vanished. Procrastinating has put me into smartphone addiction, which has made things even worse. I cant focus on anything my mind feels so overstimulated. All this has been going on past months. I hve no idea what I should do.

Title: Voice in my head.
Thread
So I dont really know how to start. I am a year old guy always done the right things, trying to be perfect, studying, caring for others, placing their needs above mine. But now ive done some bad things. Ive been together with my nowconfusion wife for years. Ive helped her with anger issues, her hitting meconfusion and her selfesteem, loving her through it all since that was a big problem. The first years after we starter, living together, not anymore. But ive been obsessed with anything sexual. It started innocent with text based stories, then videos, then cams, and once I got a whiff of clubs, I was immensely interested, but I was in a loving relationship. I could hold it off for so long. But once I was alone for a couple of days, I kept thinking of it and looking for information on those clubs. Then one day, seemingly on autopilot, I went. I went in thinking, im only going to look at it. Ugh! Thinking back, I was dumb. I mean, if you are buying cake, you are going to eat, it would you not? But it started off with a massage and ofcourse. I couldnt control my urges, so I did it yay seconds of my life for so much regret. Afterwards in the car, I couldnt believe myself. Ive been touched before by others than my of, but never done the full thing. At that time, I did the right thing and told her everything all the things from porn,To the club confusion. She knew me already so well. And considering my personality, it wasnt at all. Within my normal behavior, we were supposed to get married. So I told her everyhing I wanted to give her a way out to know who she was marrying. The weird thing is, it didnt phase her. She told me she didnt care as long as it wasnt a thing to repeat. She still wanted to marry me. She still wants kids with me. That was years ago. We are married for of them and had the loveliest wedding. And I do love her deeply. I do everything for her. I just cant believe it. I did the wrong thing, confusion in my life, and she forgave me. I just cant seem to believe her. I mean, I did some scummy things. Ive take responsibilty for it by telling and asking for forgiveness. But man, why did it grew on me like that? Now, we are some years further everyday. The voice in the back of my head tells me, you ve cheated, you dont deserve her, you should just go out of her life. During my marriage, ive never had the urges again. Yay! Thats at least one thingconfusion. Ive talked about this so many times with my wife. She still sees me as her soulmate, and I feel the same. Ive never had an emotional connection with someone like her. Thats why its so super dumb to go and use some other human being for pleasure.Without feelings isnt better than using yourself. I cant change the past. My wife still wants to continue, and she doesnt want me to leave or leave her not out of desperation or anything she just wants me. But the voice in my head is fixed on telling me otherwise or trying to remember some other fault ive ever done. And ofcourse I tell her directly, even if I dont connect reality with fantasy anymore, I just tell her its making me crazy, and I laying some emotional pressure on her as well by doing it because she doesnt have to hear all my mistakes from the past. But somehow I need to tell her its a undeniable need. Last time we talked about it, she told me the patience is getting harder for her. Lines were said, should I just divorce you just so you can feel better, which is weird. I dont want me to feel better. Ive done her wrong. This is my punishment. Ugh! I just want to make her happy. And I want to believe her words. I think it just takes time, but this is getting harder and harder to forgive myself. She proposed to treat it like it never happend. It was before we married. I dont do it on the regular. I would feel like shit if I didconfusion I told her I want to do that since it didnt add anything to our life or impacted it. But I also told her if she had questions, sheCan ask them. And by doing this, im acting on like it didnt happen, but I dont want her to think im denying it since I took responsibilty. This story got like a mumbo jumbo and sorry for any spelling mistakes. It feels good to vent. And hopefully someone has tips to let go of guilt and silencing the annoying voice in the back of my head so my wife and me can live our lives happy together or seperated, if that should be the best thingconfusion.

Title: Is it wrong to become a new person and kill old self?
Thread
I have had severe issues in childhood and did some pretty bad sick, twisted stuff never directly hurt anyoneconfusion and tried to move on. But the guilt is killing me. Still, this horrendous stuff has lead to anxiety and ocd, and feeling the universe will punish me. On the other side, I feel like I decided to remake myself not into perfect, but to be a good person. And I suppose to make it I always thought I would suffer my whole life and be a monster, and maybe I will. But now I found someone. The guilt of my childhood is coming back, and I feel I cant be happy. Part of me is saying, and signs from the universe is saying, I need to accept and become that person again, and what I did, but I always have accepted it. But I guess I dissociated with this previous self, and I killed that version in my brain, but I feel im getting signs. The person I found will be taken away because I dont deserve any hapiness. If I dont accept and become this person. However, this new person I ve become. I like I have become a better person and want to leave the old self of me dead. But my mind wont let me, and the fear of anything bad happening is killing me. I can accept, but I feel I dont deserve her. If I do accept myself as this bad person again, to be clear, I understand I did theseThings and have repented and learned from them. I just have this other self where I feel like im not that person anymore, but the universe wants to squeeze out me. The stuff I did was sick, twisted stuff. As a child, mostly done out of stupidity, I will say it involved peeing on siblings and stupid things like that. But I realize we all do stupid shit as kids, and some of it is disgusting, and I came from emotionally abusive household and all that, but still doesnt shake this uneasy feeling.
Comments
No, there is nothing wrong with that. I do not think it is the universe trying to squeeze the new you out. It just that when you were alone, I am assuming you worked on some feelings, and now you met someone. And new feelings that remind you of old ones pop out also realise the new you is still based on the old you, somehow, either by completely opposite to what you were or kept some old favorites, just pushing something away. Keeps it around. Do you still talk to your siblings? Have you talked about what happened between each other?

Title: Realistic daydreams.
Thread
Lately, whenever I daydream, I tend to feel the things my mental characters are feeling a few days ago while I was walking my dog, I was daydreaming about some stuff which included my character doing something horrible on accident, and she noticed that someone was running to the house she was in and would catch her. So she panicked and ran out. It was that part when I suddenly felt like I was being chased, like I was being caught doing something horrible. My heart began beating extremely fast, and I felt genuinely terrified. And today I was writing a story, and a creepy, unsettling scene came up as I was writing. You know how you get lost in writing, that you are not thinking about what you are writing until you wake up. It was like that. The scene was my main character finding out that, though she had locked her front door, so the person who was banging on her door the night before could not break in. But in the morning found her balcony door wide open, and I felt it. I felt terrified. My sister came in midway and scared the hell out of me, and I felt paranoid for a few moments. Can someone tell me is this bad? I do not like how it feels, but I cannot control it. Plus, it helps me write things better, but it really takes a toll on me. If anyone has any explanations or tips on it, please tell me, have aLovely day red heart

I am afraid to waste so much time this weeks are the worst nightmare to me, and I went thru it because I was improvingconfusion. This is normal when people start a new med. Once a clear med and dose is figured out through initial trial and error, youl likely be easily maintained on it. Just keep following up with your docs and take their advice.

Well, have you seen a professional and confirmed it is ptsd that you have? Youre pretty vague here. Ptsd cannot be cured. You can only manage the symptoms.

Not sure I am right, but if your asking the question your looking for help, a lot of people with bad have a plan or can quickly put one together and not saying you have bad either. Talk to your psych, they only want to help you. A psych unit might get you help if you let them. At worst, the psych should be able to give you other options.

I talk with my therapist about this unless you are in immediate danger they cannot do much. So if the plan is later not now I do not think they would do anything. You can always ask them what they would do if someone said xyz.

Title: Getting used to.
Thread
I hate it. I hate that desperately wanting to hurt and kill my self. It is just a part of my every day life, I have days where it gets worse, days where in have it in me to go through with it and actually kill my self. Following those days where I go back to my normal suicidal ideation, I feel like I am doing better like I have been cured of my mental illness and have been faking it this whole time. I hate that being suicidal is just the normal for me and that my bad days are days when I try to kill my self. I hate that. I have been living like this long enough for it to just become normal to me.

Title: Partner is paranoid.
Thread
I have been with my boyfriend for about six years. Suddenly, this week, he became super paranoid. He is an independent contractor and has not been working much the last two weeks. He lives in my hometown and has not really made any friends due to the global situation. We have been socially distancing, and he stopped going to the gym. I am an introvert who is perfectly content staying home and doing my own thing. We did dry january, and afterwards he got black out drunk. I did not even realize at the time afterwards, he was confused about his memories and expressed that he had never experienced that before. He likes to spend time online, researching and discussing math, physics and electrical engineering. He got banned from his favorite site around the time he started drinking again. Suddenly he is crying frequently and expressing that he thinks something bad is going to happen. Then the paranoia begins. He suspicious about items in the house he does not remember buying and is sure someone put them there or that they are fake. Everything seems logical to me, and I am busy with work, so I do not really notice his paranoia building. Suddenly, he is throwing away his valentine gifts and is recording evidence against me on the card I gave him he refusing to sleep in bed and accusing me of lying. He stayed up all night tearing apart the house. He pulled everything out from under the sinks and left chemicals and myHouse plants everywhere we have dogs. So this is a safety issue. He will not last me use the oven, open the blinds or turn on the lights. I have contacted his family, but they are across the country and in different continents, I tried to get him out of the house and to exercise. At first, he seemed to almost forget about his paranoid episodes. Now, I cannot even seem to get through to him. He started referring to me. In the third person mentioned, he was thinking about all the times he died and started being strange to the dogs. He locked my loyal attachment issues. Dog outside because his tail was wagging and hitting the blinds open. He pushed me out the door with the dogs and my purse. The crisis team came out, but he would not open the door, wouldn let me unlock or turn the knob. Nothing they can do but try again tomorrow, because he is not threatening to hurt himself or others. He not eating. And I do not really know what to do anymore.

Title: Constant distress.
Thread
Odin be begged. I have so much I need to say that I just do not know how to get it all down. I could write a hundred thousand words and never get through it all. I was diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder a few years ago, and it totally lines up with experiences I have been having since I was a child as an example. In my first week or two of school, I threw up on another boy. This is going back to the so the standard thing to do was to sit against the wall of the veranda with our backs against the wall and eat lunch as I am sitting against the wall eating a sandwich with strawberry jam on it. The boy next to me leans over and asks, what that peanut butter and jelly? Now I am not in america, so just imagine he said, jello same difference, but anyway, he asks again, with not even a whole second. Between queries, I am autistic and have had sensory issues. From the first, the sight of jelly could make me nauseous. So being asked if I had the shit on a sandwich I have just been biting out of, well, you are asking for trouble. Adult me would have asked him why he asks questions if he is just going to answer them himself anyway, but six year old me threw up all over him like there was no tomorrow school nurse or whatever the hell they called it then madeUs both change into loaner uniforms, my protests that I had not one drop of spew on me went unheeded. My mother did not really listen when I said it either. Again, adult me would have had plenty to say to school staff. Adult me wishes he was not an automatic so he could get the kind of training required to be the punisher of child abusers confusion. I will just keep my thoughts about what it does to me when some dipshit says with autism to myself, oh wait no, I will not. Jim sinclair wrote a post about why it is offensive a while ago now. But part of the third reads like this it nobody objects to using adjectives to refer to characteristics of a person that are considered positive or neutral. We talk about left handed people, not people with left handedness and about athletic or musical people, not about people with athleticism or people with musicality. We might call someone a blue eyed person, or a person with blue eyes and nobody objects to either descriptor. It is only when someone has decided that the characteristic being referred to is negative, that suddenly people want to separate it from the person, but moreover, it sets off my generalised anxiety disorder in a way that few other things can. Now that I am taking the medications that I need to dial the volume down. And late last year, I had to tell an entertainer that no, it is not a matter ofPreference. Nobody calls me person with maleness or person with incredibly deep voice. After all, I am constantly flooded with aggressive and spiteful feelings. I enjoy seeing specific people suffer. For example, if the people who run certain tech companies, for example, exploded on one of their crackpot, space flights challenger style, I would be laughing. And then these feelings on these things start to flood into my immediate world onto people I have met in person that they have done things to harm me in the last few months does not help, but I am constantly bombarded with visualisation of me, harming people that I either see hear regularly or used to. Recently, I often write stories about going back in time and preventing my birth. I used to write it in a way that involves talking. Now, it just involves multiple assignations. I often wonder, what would be if I were born somewhere else to different people I would mistake for being capable of raising a flea.

Title: Can someone share their specific experiences with ect?
Thread
Like, can you go through the exact things you experienced? Were you just happier? Did it change your perception of the world? Did you feel like you had reset and were like a completely different person? What about your relationships? Did you still harbour disdain for the people you did not like? And the opposite with the people you loved?
Comments
Two questions why would you need to get it? Who is suggesting it? I have never had it myself. But what I have heard second hand leads me to the conclusion that I would never consent to it. I have been told a minor was subjected to it based on his parents. Okay. Now he cannot remember why he is angry. He still feels the anger. However.

I have had rounds of ect years apart. The treatment is not scary or dramatic. You simply lie on the bed and you are given a short acting general anaesthetic, and a few minutes later, you wake up only a few times. I have felt confused for a few hours afterwards, but generally I feel relaxed and my mood has improved each time I personally will continue to have it and would recommend to friends and family.

Title: I have always had a really hard time focusing, and I do not know if it is something to overthink or if I should get medical help.
Thread
So I have never gone to a psychologist or therapist or anything like that. I have a really awful issue with getting things done and focusing. I feel like I always prepare myself to study but just get easily side tracked and do not feel like doing it. My mind always feels jumbled, like I cannot remember certain things or have to think about it longer. I physically cannot make myself stay focused on my studying. And honestly, I do not know how I have gotten through three years of college without studying once and still having a good gpa. This class I am taking, however, requires a lot of attention, and I am just not able to get myself to sit down and study sometimes when I do get the courage to study because I have procrastinated the whole week, it will be so last minute and I will start planning to cram the night before an exam. But I just end up doing nothing. And when I say nothing, I mean, absolutely nothing. I will literally go to the material, set it all up. But once I am there, my attention goes to something else. I do not know if I am just lazy or maybe I have adhd or something and should seek medical help. I am only questioning it because it is something that genuinely frustrates me so much, and I just cannot get myself to do it, no matter how many times I sit down and set everything up and tellMyself to stay focused. I do not know if those also has anything to do with it, but I noticed when I am out socializing, I constantly zone out and have to ask people to repeat what they say. I feel like I am just always lost in life. If anyone that has gone through similar obstacles, if you could share your story with me and what you think I should do, or if you think this is something to worry about, I would really appreciate it.

I feel this too. Everytime I feel motivated to study, I would prepare everything I need. Then minutes later, I would find myself watching a hour long stream. I am very frustrated because I really want to complete my tasks early, but I cant because of distractions. Sometimes I feel that maybe im just not self disciplined and lazy. I dont know what is happening to me anymore.

Go to a doctor preferably a therapist or psychologist. If you can and share these thoughts if they are not specialized, they can likely refer you to someone who can get you evaluated. I had very similar experiences and was diagnosed adhd combined type after going over my entire life history and revealing that I have had similar and other issues. I had been masking since I was as a child, not saying that is what your outcome is. But you should definitely get a professional opinion on what your experiencing. Knowing or getting a better viewpoint can help so much.

Title: Need help handling emotions I am broken
Thread
I feel like my life has just been falling apart. I feel like im falling apart. I am a year old male about to turn in a few months I lost my best friend of years to an overdose on we spoke on the phone hours before he passed. And there is not a day that goes that where im not thinking of him thats already a ton of emotion to handle. Im currently in college and am stressed with schoolwork and doing well. Now my relationship, my of and I began dating in. We were both sophomores in high school, we were high school sweethearts. We talked about our future and planned so many things. I knew she was the one I knew she was like no other. I knew. I loved this woman. We then we are separated by going away to college. They always say, long distance does not work. Ha, it doesnt. We had the strongest bond and had so much love for each other. School has began to get harder and harder. The distance is also getting harder, and it is at a point where my of cannot handle the distance anymore. We see each other every now and then. But with our love languages, long distance is not it for us and it is taking a toll on her and has caused her to fall out of love. But my mental state is terrible right now, and the only reason she is with me is because I almost offed myselfThis was before I had known she fell out of love with meconfusion. She feels terrible for the timing, but she is not in love how she was, but she is still here for me until I get help. I need help. I cannot choose. I cannot face the reality of this situation. It all feels so surreal to me. I am so empty inside. I lost my best friend to pills, and now I lost my of, who is also my of, and I feel like I have nothing else to live for. I just also had to put down my childhood dog. I feel like everything is falling apart. I just do not know if I should leave now. Wif am I thinking I know I should leave now, but I cant. Il have nobody. I cannot handle being alone right now, but I know it is the best thing to doconfusion. She is willing to stay with me until im mentally stable. But that means her breaking up with me once I am causing me to relapse into this dark abyss of my emotions or hang onto the hope of winning her love back. And maybe things can go back to how they were. I know what is best, but I do not think I can handle facing it right now. I need help

Title: It all adds.
Thread
The last month has been absolutely ridiculous. I mean, none of my life has ever really had a moderate amount of stress. It is always been really extreme, and all at once, I have been handling the individual events pretty well, but they just keep coming. And I am wearing pretty thin. I also very recently had a ptsd trigger and have been having nightmares pretty much nonstop, which is an odd symptom I have not experienced since I was a preteen. I honestly do not know how to cope with the stress. In addition to not really having a support system outside of my husband, I feel super alone. I am planning a wedding that none of my family will attend. Really, very few people will be there on my behalf at all. No one is excited to discuss wedding details with me or anything, and I feel bummed rather than excited. I am kind of starting to lose hope. They say it gets easier, and in a lot of ways it has, but I just fear that there are very few good things awaiting me in life.

To for suicidal shit, I guess not sure if this is an okay sub for this, but yeah, ink okay, so just to give to background, I am a minor, and I live in the us, I want to be honest with my therapist, but I also do not want to get sent to a psych ward.

I have a very detailed plan, like, what method, where I would be, what I would listen to, what I would do that day. Ect and I have been writing a note. I do not have access to what would be my preferred method yet, but I will in a year or two, and I have a less preferred method I could do however, it is not like I have a date sometimes I think when I move out at latest, but other times I think, what if I just did it right now instead, although I probably would not do it now, probably more in the future.

Mental health professional. Here in most states, any adult can petition to have another person sent to a psychiatric institution if they pose a clear and present danger to themselves or others. Many of the laws on this are remarkably loose that said, any decent therapist knows they must balance that power with respect for their patients autonomy and maintaining trust in the therapeutic relationship. Because of this, there are usually intermediate steps taken before resorting to hospitalization, especially when the patient is not a clear and present threat to themselves. So you have ideation and a plan. But not current means to carry out that plan that generally places someone in moderate, high risk of suicide depending on the chance that the means could become available sometime soon. This is obviously very fluid, since the plan could change. But for now it is the case. You are a clear danger to yourself if certain conditions are met, but you are not a present danger to yourself because of the lack of current means. Most therapists, therefore are not going to involuntarily hospitalize you based on that information. Instead, they will likely collaborate with you to develop a safety plan if they have not done so already, this is a essentially identifying things that trigger suicidal urges means restriction. Help you and or your parents take away possible tools that increase the likelihood of suicideconfusion and coming up with a variety of coping skills you can try in the moment if you start to feel suicidalIts very common for kids and teens who feel suicidal to believe that suicide is inevitable, like you said, a case of when, rather than ifconfusion, the vast majority of kids and teens who experience suicidal ideation, and as many as of people have experienced at least one instance of passive suicidal ideation in their lifetimeconfusion do not end up dying by suicide still, it is very hard to understand that the feeling is temporary when the urges are so strong and have felt persistent. For much of your life, I am glad you are in treatment. The only other thing you should be aware of is that in most states, therapists are required to report imminent safety risks, like suicidal urges and plans to the parents of children who experience them. Its also likely that your parent confusion will be involved in any safety planning and means restriction to help keep you safe. I recommend that you talk to your therapist about this because the more accurate and comprehensive your safety plan is the safer you will be and less likely you are to need hospitalization in the future. Hope this helps you can do

It one thing to recommend this and another thing altogether to force people against their will, which is unlikely from the way you describe things, it good to be honest. And hospitals are not scary. Youre looking at things through depression glasses, which make everything look worse. When you recover, things will look very different. Problems that seemed hopeless will suddenly have obvious solutions. A lot of things can help standard treatments and the self help recommended by therapists I have advice from experts in my comments, and you can click on my name and read, the most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It very important to calm down. This will make you feel better, and let you think clearly, a very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly.

Title: I feel like I am experiencing delirium.
Thread
I do not know how well this will sound since I am having a hard time paying attention to anything for about months, especially the last few weeks, I have felt almost disconnected from life, and I have been thinking about suicide, and I have self harmed. This is not completely abnormal for me, but I can no longer pay attention, and I am always extremely tired. I am only, and I live with a confusing father. I consider him to be abusive, especially since he threw everything I own outside and told me to get out over me. Not having an essay turned in. I have told people about how my dad treats me, and they all say it sounds exhausting and it is. But just now, I was having a flood of thoughts, and the word delirium stuck out. I searched up what it meant and was intrigued after reading about it and looking at various assessments I think I am experiencing it. There is no particular reason for me to experience delirium, but the more I read about it, the more I seem to relate to the symptoms I know, the way I feel could be from various things, especially since I am physically healthy. But I am not sure I cannot see a therapist for months. But the social workers at my school know I have cut myself but do not talk to me anymore. They stopped talking to me after they talked to my dad, and I assume he convinced themI was fine so what should I do in the months I have to wait I can barely stop myself from hurting myself but either way, I rather not feel so tired I have a friend I can talk to online and that is about the only thing that really makes me feel better but it is still hard.

I do not know if I am the best person for giving advice, but I have been experiencing depression for the last several months, maybe years, and it has helped me a great deal in confiding in my friends. Its not a cure all, but it helps with getting though the day I have never self harmed. And I am very sorry to hear that you are at such a point in your life. Thats why I would say to confide in this online friend as much as you are able to, knowing that you have someone there who cares about your life. And well, being might be what you need. Just try and take things day by day. Baby steps are the way I hope things get better

Hey, there is absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Everyone has bad days, and if they have a good heart, they will understand they most likely care about you and just want to make sure you are okay. Dont beat yourself up about it. You are doing amazing.

Title: I wish I knew what I needed to be normal.

I got no idea what to do anymore. My heart aches for someone I never had in the first place. I am so emotionally messed up, I either push everyone away for fear of regrets, heart ache and betrayal, or I end up falling head over, heals at the slightest sign of kindness. I was kicked out of my parents home just over weeks ago with my dad now in jail, and I do not know what to do with the life I have. What is the point when you have no dreams for your self other than the idea of reaching the end of an overwhelming roller coaster you never asked to be on my ex still haunt me each another expression of my affection and care invested into and then left behind bridge burned, and peace was supposedly earned. I cannot stand it. I need someone here holding my hand, but I cannot. I am not a child, but I am still childish. I am still afraid, confused and sad. It is all to much, but I still appreciate all I had just wish it was not a had but a have. How many times do you have to confess ur feelings for them to be true? How many times do I have to reconfigure my life to figure out what path I am actually on? What kind of shit should I be on smoking? Always making sure I do not end up on the other side of a loaded gun I am? INeed some help. Man what the fuck! I only know how to like, get my emotions out when I am rhyming. Sorry.

Title: I need life mental health advice.
Thread
Hey, this is my first reddit post. So please forgive me if I do this wrong. I am a. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and adhd. I currently living with my boyfriend a couple hours anyway, from our home town. We both work full time and support ourselves. We have been doing this for a year. Being an adult has been had, especially being away from most of my adult influences. I have had my entire life. Yes, I have gained a few new ones, but they are all at my work, and I do not want to ever say anything to jeopardize my job. Heres a little bit of background information that I think is important. I was raised in a house where when things were good, they were good, but when my dad starting abusing res and alcohol, he starting become emotionally abusive towards not only me, but my mom and my brother moving away was extremely good for me, but I still struggle sometimes, because I do not have a lot of friends in my new city, and I have a lot of trust issues. I just need some advice in the areas I have been struggling in. I do not know how to make boundaries. Thinking about it is overwhelming, because I do not know how to break it down in a way that my brain can understand and actually be a tool for me to use. If someone could include a real life example, I would really appreciate it.I have also been struggling with my self image not so much. My physical appearance instead, it has been my personality and who I am as a person growing is hard. Being aware of my mental health struggles has been so exhausting, and I am having a hard time communicating that to everyone in my life I cannot stretch myself as thin as I could before in my social life I think I am a good person, but I can shred myself apart and make myself think other wise. And then I second guess myself, any advice is greatly appreciated. Please also feel free to leave any other advice that might be helpful to a year old just trying to make it in life.
Comments
These sound like good topics to talk to a therapist about as there are appear to be some persistent cognition beliefs that keep you stuck, related to boundaries and self image and talking to a professional and possibly learning some new coping strategies, such as cognitive restructuring techniques via cbtconfusion, can help you to organize your thoughts in a different manner. Good luck.

If it is something that is important to you set little alarms or reminders on your phone to remind you to send them a quick, short text even if you do not have it in you to reply all day or long messages. Something is better than nothing and will make you feel better.

Title: At what point do you know you have reached your peak of insanity and need to be hospitalized?
Thread
Hi. So I am a year old girl who honestly has so much to say here there would not be enough room for everything in this one post. Il try to keep it short. I think I have driven myself to the brink of insanity past that actually all and every single one of my thoughts are delusional. Even if I am having a great day, I will still suffer. These delusional thoughts that usually consist of the way others view me and the anxiety around that I have been bullied in the past for my looks. Just the usual comments teenagers will get, and I used to be able to brush it off like nothing I am now. And I have been through a lot since I was a teen. I developed several drug addictions, contemplated suicide on many occasions seen my sister almost drink herself to death, witness the grief my father put my family through after he hung himself in our basement. And that was only the beginning fast forward to years old. I am a slave to adderall and cocaine, and my exhausting eating disorder that nearly costed me my life. You see, I struggle alot with self esteem. Some people will get called ugly and brush it off or even laugh at themselves. I have taken it to the point where I cannot even look myself in the mirror because of a few comments some people made while I was using drugs, I crackhead coke, whore, busted, etc. On the otherHand. I will have people compliment me and say, I have a unique beauty that resembles angelina jolie lao. I am a mess I cannot ever set my vape down. And I have been binge smoking weed for the past few months, and I have convinced myself I look like sloth from the goonies I never mentioned my boyfriend who claims to love me.

My mind dosent even make sense anymore. I cannot tell if it is the weed anxiety, ocd depression or body dysmorphic that is tearing me down the most or all of it together. Are you getting any mental health treatment right now? Or in the past, a professional would likely be able to help you zone in on one or two primary things to target where improvement in these areas might carryover to other things you are struggling with. Are you able to cut back on weed on your own right now? Sobriety is scary to be totally with your unfiltered thoughts and emotions, but also an important part of mental health recovery.

Title: At what point do you know you have reached your peak of insanity and need to be hospitalized?
Thread
Hi. So I am a year old girl who honestly has so much to say here there would not be enough room for everything in this one post. Il try to keep it short. I think I have driven myself to the brink of insanity past that actually all and every single one of my thoughts are delusional. Even if I am having a great day, I will still suffer. These delusional thoughts that usually consist of the way others view me and the anxiety around that I have been bullied in the past for my looks. Just the usual comments teenagers will get, and I used to be able to brush it off like nothing I am now. And I have been through a lot since I was a teen. I developed several drug addictions, contemplated suicide on many occasions seen my sister almost drink herself to death, witness the grief my father put my family through after he hung himself in our basement. And that was only the beginning fast forward to years old. I am a slave to adderall and cocaine, and my exhausting eating disorder that nearly costed me my life. You see, I struggle alot with self esteem. Some people will get called ugly and brush it off or even laugh at themselves. I have taken it to the point where I cannot even look myself in the mirror because of a few comments some people made while I was using drugs, I crackhead coke, whore, busted, etc. On the otherHand. I will have people compliment me and say, I have a unique beauty that resembles angelina jolie lao. I am a mess I cannot ever set my vape down. And I have been binge smoking weed for the past few months, and I have convinced myself I look like sloth from the goonies I never mentioned my boyfriend who claims to love me. But I feel like he is only here to have someone to love him. He does everything for me goes out of his way to help me, and I seem to not be able to believe it is genuine. The person I was with before cheated on me, which was another huge blow to my self esteem. Also, these men are both gorgeous, and I have absolutely no clue why they are with me.

Title: Anyone else in a relationship and can relate.
Thread
I think it stemmed back to when I was younger. My mom was always very angry, and I had to be cautious around her to preserve myself. She would have insane mood swings. It would always make me anxious. My partner is the same. He gets really moody. He does not take it out on me, but I can feel the moodiness, silence, annoyance, complaining. And it makes me so anxious. I feel like sometimes I am walking on eggshells around him, because I just never know if that day moment he is moody. I do not really know how to explain it, just hoping to see if anyone has a similar experience and have an advice on this

Yeah, pretty much sounds like me. My wife even has the same birthday as my mum after years. She ask for a divorce about a month ago, and I still feel like I on eggshells. I do not think I have any good advice for you but your not alone.

Think its one of those things we experience as a child that we carry along with us. Maybe a little ptsd, perhaps could be you are an empath and just sense high levels of emotions too. My mother was very much a yeller. I became an anxious child, and a host of other things have you tried speaking to him when he is not in a that state use words such as I feel. Sometimes men get defensive and listening ears turn off remember, your feelings are just as valid as his. He, too has a right to be whatever emotion he is in so long as it is not hurting anyone hope that helps

Title: I mostly never want to leave my apartment.
Thread
I am as a teenager, the day was too short as I spent most of it outside doing all sorts of fun stuffs for several years. Now I have had this total lack of interest in going out. However, when I manage to go out to parties or social gatherings, I enjoy myself and socialize like normal. But when the new friends I would connect with, try reaching out later, I will be totally uninterested, especially because I see no point on doing so. I usually spend most of my time talking to myself in my head and calculating my next move, either work related or some other issues. At first, I thought it was normal because I am in it as a software developer, but I do not think this is accurate, as my colleagues usually enjoy going out. I do not feel depressed at all. I do enjoy indoor activities, like playing video games and watching to. I am worried now, because I am in a relationship, and my partner enjoys going out with me, but I find myself struggling to cope. She understands I am this way and does not seem to be too bothered for. Now, do I have a mental issue

To for suicidal shit, I guess not sure if this is an okay sub for this, but yeah, ink okay, so just to give to background, I am a minor, and I live in the us, I want to be honest with my therapist, but I also do not want to get sent to a psych ward. I have basically told her that I just have a passive wish to not wake up, which is not really true. I have a very detailed plan, like, what method, where I would be, what I would listen to, what I would do that day. Ect and I have been writing a note. I do not have access to what would be my preferred method yet, but I will in a year or two, and I have a less preferred method I could do however, it is not like I have a date sometimes I think when I move out at latest, but other times I think, what if I just did it right now instead, although I probably would not do it now, probably more in the future. In my mind, it is more of a when not if thing and I think about it everyday anyway, my question is, would telling this to my therapist get me sent to a psych ward or

Title: Us teacher in crisis where to go from here.
Thread
I have struggled with depression since elementary school. However, my family is very much controlled by the stigma of mental illness, and I am not even sure they think they believe me that I have a mental illness and have never offered real support during my struggles. I have gone to counseling off and on. For about years I started taking anti depressants my first year as a teacher. So about years, I have tried several medications and some work better than others. My psych medicine is prescribed by my primary care doctor, and we did a dna test to see which options would work well for me, things were ok the last few months, it seems like everything is getting worse. I am not successful at work largely due to my depression. The house that I live in is in shambles. I struggle to have the motivation to clean it, and there is so much unpacking to do. I am trying to fix up and sell a house we moved out of in august. My parents are nagging me to finish the projects and get it on the market. My husband of years, is working massive overtime and is stressed by his job. My family thinks I am not taking care of the house that I am a living in and lecturing, berating us about cleanliness and upkeep, because we could not find a house in our price range in the area we would like to live. To be clear the area we were consideringWas over a mile radius confusion and are staying in a house that they own and rent out that used to belong to my great grandparents because I moved school districts at the start of this school year to escape a toxic work environment I do not have many friends close by to offer support and I very much feel like I need to be able to prove myself at work and do not feel like I can share may struggles I feel an obligation to keep just pushing through because we are at the end of a term and I need to finish coming materials and administer and complete grading for students on time taking a break seems impossible I feel like I cannot do anything right I feel like I disappoint everyone I feel no hope that things will improve I cannot shake the feeling that everyone would be better off happier if I was not around my primary care doc said I should probably see a psychiatrist because they would be more effective in managing my medications I have requested a recommendation from her and am having trouble finding someone in my area that can see me soon and work with my schedule at all because it is almost impossible to find a substitute teacher at this time spring break in coming up in a few weeks and I had a thought that perhaps some time spent in patient program during spring break might help me make some progress but I do notKnow how that process works. I called a help line, hoping they could explain the progress, and basically told me that if I felt I was a danger to my self, I should go to the emergency room and they would make the determination. But that did not seem like what I had in mind at all. I have honestly left out a lot of additional stressors, because at some point it just seems like I am making it up. I am not sure why I am posting here. I guess I hope someone can help me understand what some possible next steps are or how to navigate the system at this point.

The biggest lifeline can be a strong support group I take part in group therapy myself and I have a great circle of family and friends for my issues I know that without them I would be no where close to as balanced as I am. To use a bit of a metaphor, it is like trying to build a house on the sand without a foundation you need that foundation and that could simply even be a book club.

Title: Let it.
Thread
I am hurting so much because of harassments and heinous emotional abuse by an individual. In each therapy session, my therapist just told me to let it go. This makes me feel invalidated, as if he just wants me to stop talking about my trauma. I am not sure if this is part of therapy to just let things go and not talk about it. Is this how to deal with trauma? Is there any alternative to this?

Title: Best friend decided to withdraw from social life due to mental health.
Thread
My best friend just sent me a message acknowledging me she is withdrawing from social life for few months due to her mental health problems she said it is due to her being unable to be good friend anymore and cutting ties with lot of us due to being afraid she will hurt us now when I met her, she had just started her psychotherapy due to her anxiety and bad at first it was minor I only witnessed one anxiety attack due to very stressful test at uni. We discovered our personalities are pleasing to both us, and she really liked the fact that we could just spontaneously invite each other for some random event or the movies the day before and then going there. You cannot do that with lot of people. I closely cherished our friendship, and we even planned to go backpacking in several countries this summer. She regarded the trip as a kind of therapyconfusion, and she really wanted to go since she never met anyone who likes to backpack spontaneously without a plan like me, from basic antidepressants. She was prescribed xanax in two months. She was on verge of leaving the uni due to all the problems, and it brought me to tears since I finally found a great person on uni, and now she was on verge of giving up. She eventually got back on track and finished semester pretty well all the problems got worse, and now I received a message I mentioned in the beginning ofThe post I do not want to have a classic male approach of solving problems and dragging people out of bed when they are depressed discussed this with my therapistconfusion. I just told her it is okay. And how she prepared me for that told her I am always here if she needs me. She just said she cannot feel anything at the moment. Xanaxconfusion. And I am getting a feeling she looks as this a final state of things. I we will not be able to hangout anymore. I do not know what to feel. I am letting her deal with her own shit in this scenario and hope we will reconnect in few weeks when things get better. I have fear she will leave uni, and I will not see her again since we do not live in same townconfusion.

Update. I just had the biggest temper tantrum I have had in months. I have scared my mom I did not attack her. I broke my own property a desk chair. I threw my stuff on the floor trying to find my wallet. My wallet is important to me. Not that it entirely matters since I am unemployed, and I just realized that I am nearly broke again. Honestly, self harm is becoming a real possibility. Here my left brain is working overtime to rationalize my next keystroke. To calmly explain my experience. Was it worth it? No, I do not care about my actions or how it hurts others. Until now, I never understood the reason why people self harm it hard to care about others when your empathy is gone.

Of course this is a problem that will take time for you to work out and therapy will be very important. I will just mention that there is a very intelligent guy with a youtube channel that I think will interest you. It called asperger from the inside.

Title: How can I improve my mental health?
Thread
Im so angry all the damn time, and I do not know how to relax. I practiced gratitude, and it is not working. What do I do? I feel agitated so much like I cannot sit still. Anyone was in the same position as me and got cured. I feel like shit. All the time is there still hope for me. I lost hope.

What you are describing could be irritability from depression. Then again, you might just be stressed out. We re in no position to diagnose. Only a doctor can do that. A lot of things can help standard treatments and the self help recommended by therapists. I have advice from experts in my comments, and you can click on my name and read. I would talk with the doctor about this. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day. Any symptoms you might have, such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life affecting how you feel if you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Also, mood disorders are very treatable. The advice I always give is that just a bottle of pills is not a good approach. Suppose you could win a prize by hitting a target with an arrow, and the arrows were free. If somebody asked how many arrows do you want? You would not say which is the best one youd say, how many can I have there? A lot of things that can help, mostly things that are low cost, low risk, and easy. Think in terms of combining them

Hello, friend, of course theirs hope for you they will always be I was in the similar situation as you while I have not gotten rid of feeling agitated all time theirs been a decrease I had find som peace with my main reason as to why I was always mad for me it is that I was abused as a child and I felt no one cared that I was abused and was treated more like a burden for speaking up. Their was not one way I made it make sense to myself instead it was different things for different parts of it, like I had to find a way to find peace for having shitty parents and dealing with the disappointment in people. A big thing for me is that I had to stop viewing the world through that angry lens of people do not care as I was abused as a child. They are not good people. Simplified versionconfusion, because I was judging people to harshly and would get mad when they did not live up to a standard. The other important part to not being agitated was not running scenarios in my head that make me mad. Also, when I do get mad to not get mad at myself for being mad, instead treating it as it is okay to feel mad and I shouldnt feel ashamed and beat myself up for it. I can express it with the intent to let it go flow out of my system, as in itIs okay if I get mad as long as I do not become anger, hope this helps.

I have not been feeling well lately, having no one to reach out for help suddenly made me realize how alone I am. I am always checking on my friends and family, and now I am struggling. I have no one to talk to. When I was younger, my parents used to like me. My friends used to think I was cool, I was happy and surrounded by people I love and who love me or so I thoughtconfusion. My friends do not even call me anymore. They go out without me. I do not wish to be there if they do not want me, but it hurts. I do not know if I did anything to hurt them. I have tried to talk to them and they say, oh, it is just work, but they hang out all the time and contact me whenever they have to vent. I told my mother that I am not feeling good and did not even have a follow up call. It is especially hard to know that nobody cares when you are struggling. I wish everybody well and never to find themselves in my place. I will be fine, hopefully, and will find people who genuinely want to be my friends.

I fucking felt this one hard. Just a year ago, I was going out every day with friends who loved me and liked me. I remember us just being brothers. Now I just do not feel liked.

Friendship can be great therapy, but friends are friends, and therapists are therapists. A friend can help you take your mind off your problems for a while, and that is about it. If you cannot see a therapist, self help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self help is a way to show you are serious that does not create friction in the family. In fact, it would not be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior. Self help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self help book explains what therapy for depression is like with depression. There is what seems like a catch. People say, I know there are things that will make me feel better, getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning. But I am depressed, and I do not have the energy here. The thing very important people do have energy when they are depressed, as much energy as they always do. But for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy. We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks. A famous psychiatrist, abraham low, said that when we cannot control our feelings, we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you our of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey try this when it seems that you are tooTired to work, lie on the couch, close your eyes and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for minutes. This is a motivation trick that is been used in behavior modification programs since the if a task seems like it is too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy cleaning. Start by cleaning for, or min, and take a min break. Homework start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you are going to read by looking at headings, sub headings, etc. You do not have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise as little as min brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you do not make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve ilardi, the therapist researcher who headed the lifestyle depression project at the unit of kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise. If you go to metapsychology, you can read a psychologist review of do ilardi book splendid confusion of all the traditional mind, body practices, meditation, etc. Confusion. The one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is yoga, breathing, slow breathing, is used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder and ptsd. It safe, and it does not take any training video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise,And social support also traditional asian methods it has advice specifically for depressed students always remember that there are people you can talk to like a school counselor my comments have good info for coping in a crisis including the nigh hotline

When friendship is based on a certain need to be fulfilled like it seems with your friends, its not friendship, its trading. Your friends have now different needs compared to the past, and they get them fulfilled in the easiest and cheapest way. The question that you have to ask yourself is if these people are really friends, according to your definition of friends,

So regarding friends, I went thru and am still going thru a very similar thing. I used to help organize raves in the woods in my podunk town. I was everyone is best friend. People loved me and shouted my name when they would see me. Then I started noticing that I was initiating basically everything. Every hang out plan party or whatever I was apart of, I basically made happen, so I stopped contacting people friend group shrunk by what felt like a hundred. My remaining friends were pretty good and close, but when I moved across country, they also stopped contacting me. I moved back to the area recently, and the last connection I had here basically tried to fuck me over. I was very upset when I left state, I left with a long term girlfriend, friends, some money, etc. And when I came back, I was single. My friends had deserted me. I was damn near broke. I felt utterly alone. I stewed on it for awhile. Tbe, I was salty. I felt rejected for no reason, and with no explanation, and like I would wasted efforts, even becoming friends with these people in the first place. After I stopped being so upset, I came to the conclusion that it is likely il be alone for a long while and to get used to it. That does not sound like what anyone wants to hear. Hell, maybe it is not even healthy to tell myself that, but it was like a weightOff my shoulders. I got more fixated on the stuff I love and enjoy and dove more into that. Eventually I got a new job. And while it took some time, these people I did not become friends with till after we both left the jobconfusion, I made two friends. Its a weird situation since we are very different, but they are kind and there is understanding there, which is good enough for me. Anywayconfusion. I still do not have many friends. Those two and one hold out from another state I have known like years. So I am not exactly friend, rich, but I am content. At least what I would suggest is using your time to work on stuff you like or yourself pick up a hobby, try something new. Those things are not only fun, but interesting. Convo the next time you get a chance to make friends, finally, I would not take any of this to heart, or at least too hard. People are very self focused, and I think that I just have different expectations of friends. Are I think you should make an active attempt to find new friends, maybe look into groups for activities you enjoy. Those are nice cause commonality is already established. Ultimately, what I am trying to say is I have been there. This absolutely fucking sucks, and I am sorry you are going through it. I hope you find some good friends soon. Fam happy face smiley

I am pretty sure you are parents still love you. It is just that when you are younger, they expect you need more help. But when you are older, it can sometimes feel like you are being overbearing by constantly checking in. You can try calling her back and telling, ask her to check in on you, and that it would make you feel good if she did that. Remember, she may also have also just gotten busy or distracted herself. As for your friends. Maybe you can organize some events and invite them if they are still treating you partially. It is okay to make new friends and spend less time with the old ones. You can also tell them you feel bad when you do not get invited and see if they change behavior. Sometimes being an adult is just lonely. Pal are so caught up in their own lives, but it does not mean always mean you are not loved. I once had a friend who made all my other friends dislike me. And to this day, ink, what she said to them, she was always trying to get me fired too out of insecurity. But you know what? I found it surprisingly easy to make new friends. It did not seem like I could at first, and I was confused and sad, but new friends were so sweet too. It was hard to feel upset after that.

Title: Born to be nothing.
Thread
Sometimes I feel like I was born to be nothing more than an anxious, depressed addict destined to die of an overdose forgotten and hated. Born into a family of alcoholics and drug addicts from both of my parents drinking and screaming at each other everyday to people in my extended family being known as the town junkie that does too much heroin and falls asleep in the supermarket. People tell me to be better than them. But how is that possible when the best I ever felt even at years old was when I was sick and my parents would give me cough syearup with codeine. And that warm, comforting feeling told me nothing matter. It would be ok. I am falling into a black hole, and all I want to do is accept my place as part of the darkness that is been running through my veins since I took my first breathe

You are likely genetically more predisposed to addiction. But a huge part of managing that process is environmental, like whether you surround yourself with addicts and substancesconfusion. And another huge part is how you learn to cope with difficulties. Instead of turning to relief from substancesconfusion, you can absolutely work on these two things, and there is support out there.

Title: I made a promise.
Thread
Last night, my best friend and I got really emotional and talked about our mental health issues. We re both severely depressed, she is suicidal, and I have anorexia, nervosa, and we are both incredibly worried about each other, but try to support each other as much as possible. She wants me to recover and get professional help. But I still have a long way to go before I can recover. It, not possible right now. So she wanted to make a promise between the two of us. We all both start therapy this year. We all both survive this together. It scares me, but I do not want to let her down. I am going to be doing it for me and for her. I want us to be happy, and I hope we can achieve happiness together.

First, remember that the mortality of anorexia is higher than any other mental illness. There could be a very simple solution to your problem, and it is based on the fact that these two problems, anorexia and depression, are treated different ways. As the first video shows teenagers with anorexia do much better with family based treatment than with individual therapy with office visits. I mention that there is another treatment that is often successful debt. Video confusion therapists sometimes use methods from debt, as this article explains. Studies show that relaxation methods help with anorexia, although, of course, you have to be extremely careful about exercise, as this is usually part of the problem about relaxation. The research on controlled breathing is amazing. A study with war veterans convinced the va to recommend this for vets with ptsd debt. An excellent therapy for behavior problems recommends a number of coping methods, including paced, breathing. It very important to calm down it good for you at the dinner table and your parents. A very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical behavior therapy, which helps people who have bad recommends this breathe, gently, hand on your belly, to feel it go in and out and breathe seconds in breath and seconds out, breath till you feel ok.

Title: Best friend decided to withdraw from social life due to mental health.
Thread
My best friend just sent me a message acknowledging me she is withdrawing from social life for few months due to her mental health problems she said it is due to her being unable to be good friend anymore and cutting ties with lot of us due to being afraid she will hurt us now when I met her, she had just started her psychotherapy due to her anxiety and bad at first it was minor I only witnessed one anxiety attack due to very stressful test at uni. We discovered our personalities are pleasing to both us, and she really liked the fact that we could just spontaneously invite each other for some random event or the movies the day before and then going there. You cannot do that with lot of people. I closely cherished our friendship, and we even planned to go backpacking in several countries this summer. She regarded the trip as a kind of therapyconfusion, and she really wanted to go since she never met anyone who likes to backpack spontaneously without a plan like me, from basic antidepressants. She was prescribed xanax in two months. She was on verge of leaving the uni due to all the problems, and it brought me to tears since I finally found a great person on uni, and now she was on verge of giving up. She eventually got back on track and finished semester pretty well all the problems got worse, and now I received a message I mentioned in the beginning ofThe post I do not want to have a classic male approach of solving problems and dragging people out of bed when they are depressed discussed this with my therapistconfusion. I just told her it is okay. And how she prepared me for that told her I am always here if she needs me. She just said she cannot feel anything at the moment. Xanaxconfusion. And I am getting a feeling she looks as this a final state of things. I we will not be able to hangout anymore. I do not know what to feel. I am letting her deal with her own shit in this scenario and hope we will reconnect in few weeks when things get better. I have fear she will leave uni, and I will not see her again since we do not live in same townconfusion.

You did the right thing. Just knowing that someone is there for you if you need them means alot. I would say give her space, but also her if its ok if you check up on her every couple days, it does not have to be in person over the phone or through text, but just ask her if that is an option.

Title: Is it bad that I confusion see myself in rue bennett from euphoria?
Thread
I copy pasted this because I originally wanted to put this in euphoria, but I did not think it was the right place. Also in the middle of a mental breakdown, I also do not know if this is the right flair for anyone who doesn hasn. Watch euphoria. Rue bennett is the main character of the show. I assume she does drugs, and after going out of rehab, she relapsed. She repeatedly uses drugs. And in the latest episode, season episode, rue mother is informed that rue relapsed, and rue goes into a rage. Rue mom flushed down all the drugs she had, and rue upset, be those drugs were not hers. Rue still does drugs, thoughconfusion but anyways, I relate to rue a lot. I do not do drugs, but I am so explosive and mean and emotional for no reason, and I find myself being verbally mean to people I love. I want to apologize, but I do not know how, and I do not think they trust me when I apologize, because I am so mean all the time, I do not think I am abusive. I hope not. I say things that I do not know are mean and I hurt people. Sometimes I am too prideful and I and hesitant to apologize. I think I need help. I really want to talk to people, but I do not want them to think I am crazy or say it is normal. My mom has always taken what I said about me.Feeling like a bad person and always brushing it off, she would say how it is normal for me to feel this way in my teenage years. Please tell me anything I need to know. I do not know what I am asking for at this point, but say anything you want about this.

Now I do not know how to start this so I will head straight to the point now if you have seen my other posts on this subreddit then you know what happened and I will tell the people who do not know my father passed away a year later my grandmother did too I was pretty much normal between than and after I was fine but now the panic has really set in and I have realised so much things what normally happens to people in around months has happened in around weeks now I think I am just overreacting but I simply do not know what is happening I have lost interest in everything I like making music art. I and I find that I am just all over the place and I think myself am faking it now I have gotten myself into situations I hate, like finding things out, getting obsessed with it than eventually hating it for some reason I find sunsets night day or just anything that looks like a chill place. For example, chill camp in vrchat depressing. It might just be that I have no friends to do it with, but I have tested it with friends, and it is still depressing everytime I look up at a starry night on a private map on vrchat, it makes me cry to put this in retrospect, listen to either alone by marshmello or death bed by powfu! To show how it feels to me when I look at theNight sky. I have lost grip of reality and myself. It feels really good that this is out now. And I have told at least someone.

I live in australia, and as a gen, I am expected to go out socializing in clubs. My friends ask me a lot of the times, but I get denied by parents. They do not even want me to move out. My sis has a of, but she is not allowed to hangout with him in a shopping mall or go out with friends. Coz, she is a girl. She feels trapped that why she wants to get married asap. My second self is the real me. With my friendsconfusion, where I want a tattoo, want to move out, want to socialize and date someone. If I tell them what I want, mum will just go crying and tell me I betrayed her or something I am losing my self value and have no idea what to do. And sometimes I just do not feel happiness. If you read the whole thing, I appreciate it. Thank you. A suggestion would be nice happy face or smileyconfusion.

I do not want to give you any false advice, but the description you gave of your mum makes me think you should visit raisedbynarcissists I do not mean to be rude, but yeah, you will probably get a lot of support over there. Also them stray tongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry.

Sometimes grieving pal do not want to say much, but will be comforted by your presence. You can also give her a distraction, like ask her to help you solve a problem in your life and take her out to discuss. It feels really good to help other pal sometimes, so maybe it will help her too. Taking her out of the house as much as possible, like maybe walks or at the beach, etc.

The best thing you can do is be there for her as much as is possible let her direct the conversation as much as she can or feels comfortable with and if you have to direct the conversation the best choices are things that have nothing to do with her pet or pets in general if she has a passion for music is a good choice if films and so on she needs a shoulder to cry on is one way to look at it always remember that grieving is a process it takes time and the amount of time it takes is different for every person you cannot be there a hundred percent of the time but you can give her enough attention to ease the adjustment

Check up on her message. Her everyday does not need to be a long message, but a thinking of you, how are you holding up? Would be nice, do little things for her that could help buy her flowers or chocolates or a small gift. If you can afford it, offer to help her out if she needs anything done, such as getting rid of old pet toys, etc. Confusion. Good luck you are a great friend, sister.

I feel alone, and I want to be friends with everybody. I have been an outcast ever since high school, and the couid did not help. I am basically socially awkward. When I joined facebook, I drew all my friends to show them my appreciation for their friendship, but my drawing was horrible, and they unfriended me because of that. I also tried to befriend a librarian, but she is a librarian, and it is not allowed now, it is too late, and I cannot go out because of the pandemic.

I am sure you be able to make new friends if you need to talk with somebody. There is a site with a very good reputation and free chat cups. Donna carnegie, daughter of self help legend dale carnegie, has written a version of her father classic, which is one of the most popular self help books of all time. It called how to win friends and influence people. For teen girls, you might want to talk with somebody with training for this warm linesembarrassed or blushing.

Title: Weird voices, thoughts are they a hallucination? Or what mention of suicideconfusion?
Thread
This has been somethings thats been puzzling me for years now, when I was, I got extremely depressed and experienced something weird. I had thoughts in my head more like people, and the story behind them was that they were people who had commited suicide and needed to get someone to kill themselves in order to go to the afterlife. It wasnt a voice I heard outside just in my head, and there were several. One was a girl who was extremely mean and made me harm myself. And there was this guy who was her assitant and extremely kind. He was kind of a father figure type and didnt want me to die after I attempted to kill myself out of guilt. And they stopped. I know this because I could tell when it was just me thinking the thoughts as opposed to them actually being there, and I felt extremely lonely. I wouldnt experience this again until when I was there being a super depricating thought, not connected to any story and a super kind one. This time, it was accompanied with thoughts of the world not being real, thinking there were shadow monsters all around me and thinking an earth quake happened. I discovered that it didnt happen. When I googled it laterconfusion. Once again I could tell when the thoughts stopped being real, and I was making it up current day. I dont know if I have a thought in my head with me when I have a panic attack about timesA monthconfusion a reassuring paternal thought comforts me and gives me unconditional love and support. But I cant tell if its me thinking it or it in its own. I kind of think its just a coping mechanism for my lonliness and lack of paternal love. I dont have access to therapy right now, and I am just desperate to figure out even a sliver of whats going on in my mind to drconfusion. I have had personified. Thoughts appear at low points in my mental state, and I cant tell what they are. Im hoping someone could say if its a hallucination, a product of my imagination or what
Comments
Hi, dear. First of all, only a qualified professional can say with more certainty what is going on. So take any comment with a grain of salt, the voices, thoughts you sense as other people could be a sign of dissociation and a fragmented psyche. Due to childhood trauma, you can take a look into dissociative disorders and see if there is more symptoms. You can recognized the other things you feel are not real could be psychosis, dissociation, and psychosis can be commorbid. So take a look on both. You can also check maladaptative daydreaming as well.

As anyone in the uk who is not shitting stacks of gold out their ass knows, nos, mental health services have been abysmal for longer than ive been alive for many different reasons. Nowadays, being waiting times, I am just defeated. With the couid means we can only do phone consultations. Is they spout? Now, meaning that most appointments and therapy is virtual. I get it, I do. But for someone who lives behind a screen and thinks that is part of the problem, I do not want to do this. Am I being picky? Yeah, probably do I think im entitled to this? No, do I still consider their lack of effort to even try and accommodate this a failure? Yes, I have been on terrible meds for a year. I take them only because I will feel like death if I dont, but it has no effect on my mood. Ive relapsed on suicidal thoughts and self harm, and I genuinely feel im alone in this, no matter how much shitty propaganda bullshit they push to say they are there. I have had phone consults, always with someone different, always the same conversation, and im tired of it. I received a letter which said I was on a the severe side of the depression scale. But in the same letter was told that I was not accepted into any waiting lists. Its a scene from a shitty political comic. Im so angry because im tired of feeling this way. I need help and imBeing high five and told, im doing great instead of getting a hand to lift me out the water, im tired.

They re abysmal. We ve been waiting for years for the local cut therapist position to be filled. And the only suicide intervention offered in our shitty little welsh town is a night in the cop shop cells so they can keep an eye on you. Meanwhile, the politicians are cutting funding everywhere to pay for their second houses and nepotistic private education.

Nos, sucks. Er sucks. Even more, was about to walk in, er, halfway realized nobody can help me. Nothing can fix shit unless I do. So, er called me back, and I have told them, I am heading home. They wanted my address and basically threatened me that they will send an ambulance to pick me up like, seriously, no drugs can fix shit, especially when people are assholes. Its not a mental illness that people are shit. They treat you shit. And I are not ever visit any healthcare ever again. I am much better. Thanks to my own efforts. I am clean, sober and progressing with life on my own. And god, I guess not religious, but felt like he sure did helped me, though,

I hear you, I have endured decades of a system that was supposed to prevent this kind of shit being cut and cut and cut until well, this kind of shit happens. Looking for local support groups, people who get together and talk might be a good idea. It can help to just share or listen to stories. That is what I can suggest. I told the chemist who fills my prescriptions for medications that cost me ninety two dollars a hit whilst I live on a disability pension, that if being mentally ill came with superpowers, the constant slashing and burning of services would be reversed very quickly.

I treat myself as the only person who im allowed to treat like dirt and I dont know why I do this but its been a constant my entire life I can never give myself props or feel good about myself consistently because its just me I can do things the same or even better than others but they are all fine im actually worthless. And just a thing at the end of the day I dont know why I give myself leeway to demolish myself when I cant even think of doing it to someone else. Its like I think I have free reign to destroy my own self esteem for some sick satisfaction that im the only person I can step on. So even if I recognize how awful a way to live this way is I just think, well its me im a piece of shit I deserve it even if I logically dont I really want this to stop. Ive thought about suicide every day since years old, and even if I know I would never do it dosent stop me fantasizing about mutilating myself or imagining being crumpled under a car or splattered on cement. This mindset is even preventing me from getting therapy because although I want to get better, I dont. At the same time, I want to keep the cycle of self destruction going. This is too much for reddit and I really should organize a therapist, but I needed to vent these feelings somewhere because I knowLogically, im worth more than I treat myself. Any advice or help would be appreciated.

As you say this is not a problem that can be resolved with one of these comments it will time for you to work out your solution to the problem and professional help seems like a very good idea I will just leave you with this thought to help sick people a doctor has to be well to take care of your responsibilities you need wellness that not selfishness it is being responsible

Because it is the example you felt from your early childhood. For whatever reason, emotional distance overt criticism, there are multiple things that can lead to this. I am the same I would do times more for my friends than for myself. Instead of going from that to full on loving myself, I have started trying to think of myself as one of my friends group, which is a lie. I have no friends. But whateverconfusion that already helps me phrase my feelings in a very different context and slowly has an effect on how I deal with myself. Compassion is one major thing that suddenly starts to raise its head. Having compassion with yourself is a huge step. I have also started to feel like it is due to my extreme expections on myself. I have started to consciously think of myself as average. Even though when I was young, I absolutely hated the idea of being average. Mediocrity is fine. Most truly happy. People are perfectly content. Being mediocre. There a lot to be said for it. I am not saying to strive to be mediocre, but just have that expectation of yourself. If you are better, cool. If not who cares, it helps me temper my shame at not being perfect, you re not. You never be perfection is a lie. Perfection is always more. It always you

Title: Dating girl who has bad
Thread
So after meeting her and talking for maybe a week, I started already feeling like something is off. More. We talked and met more. I started to feel like something is not right. And she seemed to be broken somehow, like I could easily tell that she really liked me. And she said that she definitely wants to meet again. But then suddenly everything turned around and she built these walls around her. We were still talking, and I know I did not do anything wrong, and it felt like her mindset is that she really wants to meet, but something is holding her back, and like she seemed to be protecting her from something bad happening or hurting her that she might think that she is not good enough and she cannot keep me attracted, that what I was thinking and feeling, I tried lightly to ask her out few times, not because I desperate but to make her maybe feel little bit better about herself and show that I want to meet her as she is. Eventually she opened up and told me that she broke up recently from abusive relationship, and also she is been seeing therapist, and she got diagnosed bad. Almost everything. What I thought I was right about I felt so bad for her and for a moment I lost myself because I really caring person and I just wanted to help or even make her day even slightly better. But I know that it comes off just being heavyAnd overbearing for her I mean I kind of forgot that I here dating not being therapist or a friend I do not even know her that well so I told her that I understand her situation and appreciate that she let me know I guess it is best for her to spend time with her friends and by herself healing for now I did not know what else to do because things were not going anywhere and it felt that if I stay it just will make things worse I still keep snapchatting like good morning good night etc just something light it seemed that she got upset or even angry and now she does not really talk anything I wanted to give her space but ink if I also triggered her fear of abandonment by giving her space this is what I felt after reading more about bad. In the end, I just met really good hearted person who is company I enjoyed, and I want genuinely, to get know her better and I still think the same and I want to give her time. She was open and honest and I just do not know how to handle people with bad, since this is my first time hearing about this. And I not desperate. I just would like to understand her better

I just met really a good hearted person whose company I enjoyed. She has bad, bright. Most people with bad pwbpdconfusion are good and caring individuals. Their problem is not being bad, but rather being unstable. Indeed, a pwbpd typically exhibits the warmth, spontaneity vulnerability and purity of expressions that otherwise are seen only in young children. This is why pwbpd usually are very easy to fall in love with it. Thus is not surprising that of the world most beloved women, marilyn monroe, judy garland and princess diana all had full blown bad. If their biographers are correct, she got upset or even angry, and now she does not really talk anything bright. An untreated pwbpd carries much anger inside from early childhood. You therefore do not have to do a thing to create the anger. Rather, you only have to do or say some minor thing that triggers a release of anger that is already there. This is why a pwbpd can become very angry in only a few seconds. Ink. If I also triggered her fear of abandonment by giving her space, perhaps so bright, or you may have triggered her strong fear of engulfment, the result is that until she has completed many years of training to learn the missing emotional skills, whatever you do will be hurtful to her much of the time, she often will perceive you as being hurtful when you do something and hurtful, when you don do it, this conundrum is due to the position of herTwo great fears abandonment and engulfment at opposite ends of the very same spectrum. This means you often find yourself in a lose situation, because as you back away from one fear to avoid triggering it, you will start triggering the fear. At the other end of that same spectrum, your predicament is that the solution to calming her abandonment fear, drawing close, and being intimateconfusion is the very action that triggers her engulfment fear. Likewise, the solution to calming her engulfment fear moving back away to give her breathing. Spaceconfusion is the very action that triggers her abandonment. Fear as you move close to comfort her and assure her of your love, you eventually will start triggering her engulfment fear making her feel like she is being suffocated and controlled by you. Because she has a weak sense of self identity, she easily becomes very enmeshed in your strong personality during sustained periods of closeness and intimacy. Yet, as you back away to give her breathing space, you will find that you have started triggering her abandonment fear. In my years of experience with my bad ex, I found that there is no midpoint solution between too close and too far away confusion where you can safely stand to avoid triggering those two fears. Until a pwbpd learns how to better regulate her own emotions and tame her two fears that goldilocks position will not exist. This is why a relationship with an untreated pwbpd typically is characterized by a repeating cycle of push youAway and pull you back. Indeed, even if you are sitting perfectly still and not saying a word, a pwbpd who is experiencing hurtful feelings will project those feelings onto you. Her subconscious does this to protect her fragile ego from seeing too much of reality and to externalize the pain getting it outside her body. Because that projection occurs entirely at the subconscious level, she will consciously be convinced that the painful feeling or hurtful thought is coming from you. This is why an untreated pwbpd usually believes the outrageous accusations coming out of her mouth at the moment she is saying themconfusion. Hence as long as you remain in a relationship with an untreated pwbpd you will often find yourself hurting her. I triggering her engulfment fear as you draw near triggering her abandonment fear as you draw back and triggering her anger, even when you are sitting still and saying absolutely nothing. This, at least, has been my experience bright

I recently encountered similar issues with my daughter seeking help in canada when going through the public sector for care we were given an estimated wait time of six months to one year and never heard back my daughter has reached out to provincial crisis lines and been put on hold at one point she hung up herself after fifty minutes when writing about issues as a constituent I would recommend starting out by clarifying who you are and why they should care basically start out by literally stating you are a member of their constituency with serious concerns regarding the current state of the mental health services in your area I included as much information as I could and stated clearly that I had reached out to local newspapers as well. I provided information regarding my daughter lack of treatment and very clearly stated that due to this she had attempted to end her life while on hold with the crisis service she was directed to for fifty minutes. I also made mention of past articles siting our provinces mental health crisis care crisis and promises made by both the provincial government and my areas representatives to rectify this that as yet have not been followed through on. I cannot say how much writing will do. But there has been more focus on mental health and the ongoing crisis in our province, which has pressured representatives to take action

Hi. So I have been posting in this sub for sometime, and ik everyone has always bene helpful, and I am grateful for it. I have bipolar, bad and ocd. Things have not been great for me, and I am still trying, but at moments I feel like im faking all of it. The meds thats I was taking made me more suicidal, and it was giving me those thoughts all the time, so I stopped taking them altogether. And for the first days, I was feeing great, but things took a turn again. Recently, I started getting suicidal thoughts again. And its not just limited to that ill try to state an instance. So I was walking by the road and saw a stray dog, and I felt bad for him. No matter I try to ignore, I still feel bad for the stray animals I see, and yet I ignore them and move, but my mind is stuck there. It makes me feel like a horrible person, and I cant get over it moreover, now I feel like that the incidents I caused may have made people suffer around, and I feel like im doing more damage to others. I feel that mental health is just an excuse of me being sadistic. I hate myself more and more and at times feel terrible. If anyone know whats going bad inside me, please help

Title: Us teacher in crisis where to go from here.
Thread
I have struggled with depression since elementary school. However, my family is very much controlled by the stigma of mental illness, and I am not even sure they think they believe me that I have a mental illness and have never offered real support during my struggles. I have gone to counseling off and on. For about years I started taking anti depressants my first year as a teacher. So about years, I have tried several medications and some work better than others. My psych medicine is prescribed by my primary care doctor, and we did a dna test to see which options would work well for me, things were ok the last few months, it seems like everything is getting worse. I am not successful at work largely due to my depression. The house that I live in is in shambles. I struggle to have the motivation to clean it, and there is so much unpacking to do. I am trying to fix up and sell a house we moved out of in august. My parents are nagging me to finish the projects and get it on the market. My husband of years, is working massive overtime and is stressed by his job. My family thinks I am not taking care of the house that I am a living in and lecturing, berating us about cleanliness and upkeep, because we could not find a house in our price range in the area we would like to live. To be clear the area we were consideringWas over a mile radius confusion and are staying in a house that they own and rent out that used to belong to my great grandparents because I moved school districts at the start of this school year to escape a toxic work environment I do not have many friends close by to offer support and I very much feel like I need to be able to prove myself at work and do not feel like I can share may struggles I feel an obligation to keep just pushing through because we are at the end of a term and I need to finish coming materials and administer and complete grading for students on time taking a break seems impossible I feel like I cannot do anything right I feel like I disappoint everyone I feel no hope that things will improve I cannot shake the feeling that everyone would be better off happier if I was not around my primary care doc said I should probably see a psychiatrist because they would be more effective in managing my medications I have requested a recommendation from her and am having trouble finding someone in my area that can see me soon and work with my schedule at all because it is almost impossible to find a substitute teacher at this time spring break in coming up in a few weeks and I had a thought that perhaps some time spent in patient program during spring break might help me make some progress but I do notKnow how that process works. I called a help line, hoping they could explain the progress, and basically told me that if I felt I was a danger to my self, I should go to the emergency room and they would make the determination. But that did not seem like what I had in mind at all. I have honestly left out a lot of additional stressors, because at some point it just seems like I am making it up. I am not sure why I am posting here. I guess I hope someone can help me understand what some possible next steps are or how to navigate the system at this point.

I feel an obligation to keep just pushing through because we are at the end of a term, and I need to finish coming materials and administer and complete grading for students on time. Taking a break seems impossible, as impossible as it may feel. Try to shut off every once in a while, even if it means not everything gets done or not done as well as it can be. Taking care of yourself likely requires certain boundaries and acceptance of your limits. I had a thought that perhaps some time spent in patient program during spring break might help me make some progress, but I do not know how that process works outside of celebrity rehab type places and substance abuse facilities. There are not a lot of general inpatients, and acute inpatient is for brief, suicidal or psychosis stabilization, which does not sound like what you need. I think your best bet is to follow up with a psychiatrist while also trying to make some positive changes on your own. Take breaks. Don try to be perfect work on being more self forgiving, eat and sleep better. Good luck.

To for suicidal shit, I guess not sure if this is an okay sub for this, but yeah, ink okay, so just to give to background, I am a minor, and I live in the us, I want to be honest with my therapist, but I also do not want to get sent to a psych ward. I have basically told her that I just have a passive wish to not wake up, which is not really true. I have a very detailed plan, like, what method, where I would be, what I would listen to, what I would do that day. Ect and I have been writing a note. I do not have access to what would be my preferred method yet, but I will in a year or two, and I have a less preferred method I could do however, it is not like I have a date sometimes I think when I move out at latest, but other times I think, what if I just did it right now instead, although I probably would not do it now, probably more in the future. In my mind, it is more of a when not if thing and I think about it everyday anyway, my question is, would telling this to my therapist get me sent to a psych ward or
Comments
From the sound of what you are saying. It sounds like you could benefit from a visit to the psych ward. Your therapist does need to know the extent of the problem in order to deliver effective therapy, and it sounds like you have a very big problem. Although they are trained against it, survivor guilt is a real thing for therapists too.

Title: My best friend chose to get laid rather than celebrate my birthday.
Thread
So for many years, I have hated my birthday. Long story short. It is never been about me due to my classmates and or family ignoring me. Something bad had always happend and shit just sucked. Last year, I went through a breakup with a previous best friend on my birthday, and it fucking sucked. My current best friend said that he promised that the next year will be better since I would live a lot closer a year passes. And a, about weeks ago, he started talking with someone who he met on tinder. I was really happy for him, and I genuinely was. Some red flags has popped up, but she seems like a cool gal, but during a talk over week ago, he mentioned that this weekend he was going to go visit her, leaving the, which is my birthday. I did not mention it at first thinking he must have forgotten. So let us see how long until he realizes he realizes it and goes very underwhelmingly in the beginning of a league of legends game. Oh, it is your birthday. That is all he says to begin with. Time goes by. I tell him, it kind of sucks. You are leaving on my day, but I want him to meet her inside of me. I really hope he chooses to be with me as he promised he can meet her. Another time, right? They just started talking. He says, he will come by in the morning after work to say hiBefore going to her place its better than nothing and I look forward to it finally the day and he does not call it gets closer to the time where he has to leave for her and he then texts me saying he will not make it. He does not even suggests that I just meet him for a bit by the train station ink why but I am just so fucking heart broken that he chose a girl he had known for less than a month over his best friend of almost years. I fucking took him for an awesome fucking tent trip in the woods because he was sad no one was celebrating him I did everything I could to make him feel as important as he is to me because he is but I feel like I am less than a random girl online there more to the story. And I know I might be selfish, but I really had hope that this year would be different. I am giving up on my birthday. Fuck this shit

To be fair its your birthday you, the right to be selfish for today. As for your friend I feel you should tell him how this hurt you and that you would have liked to hang out with your best friend for your birthday if really chose this girl he just met over a friend. He knows for years, you may need to talk about your friendship like for real. I hope your day gets better.

Maybe you can do that tell other people and all rent. Go to an empty, blank whiteconfusionroom with food and an alarm to tell you when to eat and cover it with a room wall coloured paper. If room is white, it should be whiteconfusion. I do not recommend doing it, especially for more than if you do it for days, you might go crazy, and you will be extremely bored. Or you could try meditating, closing your eyes in a place with no soundconfusion for a hour or something, but be careful and talk to your therapist a therapist about this, if possible, hope this helped

Title: I do not feel like myself or that I exist.

Recently, I have been struggling with my anxiety and depression much more than usual. In turn, I have begun to have the sudden feeling that I do not exactly feel like myself or like a person that exists at all. I am working on improving my mental health, especially my anxiety and depression. And I even have an appointment with a psychologist on monday. However, I have not really started having this strange disassociation with myself until recently. What is going on? Is it a symptom of stress or anxiety that I have not come in contact before? Or could it be something more? I have had a lot of changes in the past few months, including being a caregiver for my grandfather, my fiance, moving in with me and quitting two jobs. I just do not know what is going on.

I have the same thing. I have so much anxiety from being expected to be the great one in the family. My parents constantly force me to be better than everybody, which isnt aided by the lack of help from teachers, etc. This has led to me feeling like a person changed. For the worse, I hate myself. I dont want to live as this person publicly. Im fine, but within my room, which is the only place I get emotional, I am breaking down constantly doubting my ability to do well in life. Despite my academic successes, its really a terrible thing. I have no idea how to suppress, let alone fix it.

Does it have to be sleep or could it be just secluding yourself like, are you trying to escape your own thoughts or just a hectic life?

Title: I do not feel like myself or that I exist.
Thread
Recently, I have been struggling with my anxiety and depression much more than usual. In turn, I have begun to have the sudden feeling that I do not exactly feel like myself or like a person that exists at all. I am working on improving my mental health, especially my anxiety and depression. And I even have an appointment with a psychologist on monday. However, I have not really started having this strange disassociation with myself until recently. What is going on? Is it a symptom of stress or anxiety that I have not come in contact before? Or could it be something more? I have had a lot of changes in the past few months, including being a caregiver for my grandfather, my fiance, moving in with me and quitting two jobs. I just do not know what is going on.

Dissociation is an innate response to stress overload. It is your brain attempt to protect itself by disconnecting from high stress situations. It is common in people who have severe anxiety, depression or other symptoms.

Yes, once when my parents did not respect my personal borders, I threw a pizza cutter at a table, and it left a cut behind. I am not proud of that, not at all.

Yes very much. So I will not tell you the massive story of it. I fell into a massive depressive state I gave up on my entire life because of it stopped my studies stopped pursuing my career I wanted to fall asleep and never wake up but every day I woke up to my sad reality lost sense of who I once was, etc. For the last months or so, ive been working on myself and have been getting much better. And one thing that really helped is realizing that while yes, you could have acted better, mental breakdowns for normal people is a completely reasonable response to overwhelming stress. You cannot change the past and never will be able to. While we all have our demons that we would like to change, we cant make peace with them and move past it. Life can only go forward, edit the massive story being exactly my mental breakdown. Laugh, my a off. Sorry for the wall of text

Sometimes when I have a mental breakdown or something like a panic anxiety attack, I try to reach out to someone for help, just to have a friend to talk to or something I then immediately feel guilty for doing that like I am just a bother. They do not care I am being needy, etc. I know just contacting someone does not sound so bad, but that guilt will stay with me for a long time and makes me feel pathetic.

About a month ago, I cursed out my friend during an anxiety attack. They were just trying to have a conversation with me, and I snapped and started yelling, I am thankful they have not left me because of that. Another time I threatened to kill myself during some kind of breakdown, my boyfriend was so scared and worried he could not do anything, because I kept saying, if he left, I was going to commit suicide. I feel really bad about that one.

I threatened suicide a few days ago during an episode and it cost me the healthiest friendship I have ever had. Delusional ideation combined with an extreme fear of abandonment never ends well and I desperately want to go back in time and stop myself from talking to them while having a nervous breakdown.

Title: Actively self sabotaging because my sick brain is tired.
Thread
About or years ago I was enrolled in this program and I was so happy because I finally figured out what I wanted to do with my life unfortunately, because of my personal situation at that time, I ended up having to leave the city where my school was fast forward to today I worked really hard to be stable, like so hard, still had some issues woth the jobs, but I was always able to find work anyways I had gotten to a point where I was finally ready to go back. So I enrolled in the course and I started about months ago everything has gone to shit I dont know what happened I mean, I still have to work because of rent and I need my car to get to the school its in another town, because I live in a small town and the next town over is the only place that has this courseconfusion. Ive cut back as much as I possibly can. I dont have a lot of bills, but I do have the loan for my car because I didnt have any money saved up from working minimum wage anyways, I was able to get a loan, so I could buy a car, and honestly, thats whats eating up my paychecks. But regardless, ive just been so tired I wake up at am and get home around? Am I go to work directly after school but I still only do like hour shifts. I love, alone with cats andI still have laundry and cleaning and all that shit to do I have to make meals to go and I just dont have time to even think aboit anything needless to say I couldnt concentrate on my school work and my teachers were getting very frustrated with me to the point where they blatantly refused to help me with the exercises I locked my keys in my car. I know it happens to everyone at some point but I hadnt slept in iver hours that day because I also suffer from insomnia when im all wound upconfusion I fell asleep during my supper break at work, passed out on my couch while still in uniform more times than I cam count without taking a much needed shower. I took it in the morningconfusion, and I even mistook my shampoo for toothpaste. My teachers were aware that I was working a lot, and then finally, one monday morning, I missed my alarm and slept through my entire school day. I woke up at like theyare very strict, and im only allowed so mamy days, even if there motivated and I already. So it was just all downhill from there. The thing is, though, I just my brain just decided that wed be better off if I stopped going. I was embarrassed that I was too tired to go to school, and it sounds just stupid when I say iy like everyone goes through this and more and so I should be able to handle it. MyTeacher didnt even listen to anything I told him he just told me to come in and close my file and give them the key back for my tool boxconfusion I had asked for maybe cutting down my hours he said sure, fine but since I had already missed the one day I knew they were annoyed and I just couldnt face that so I being the coward that I am didnt go in the next day and then he said I had to come in so the other teacher could do his teaching capsule and I still flaked out because I felt guilty and anxious about the whole thing and it basically just led to me flat out quitting and I know its just my tired brain losing its damn mind but now im in a situation where im forcing myself to quit something I care aboit more than anything and its breaking my heart. I see myself doing it, but I cant stop. I dont even know what to tell him. When I go drop off the keys tomorrow, I want to beg for him to let me stay. But its not like the problems have just gone away. I still need to work. Im not a child other, and I should have a better hold on these things and more discipline, which just makes it worse, because I just come off as super immature and its caused me to antagonize the people whose help I need, but I know this, but I alsoKnow he doesnt care so theres no point in saying anything but if I dont say it then I cant go back to my course and ergo my entire future is over and its my day next week and my dad just told me he was proud of me this past monday and he doesnt know that im just spiralling and I know there are ressources out there but there are no ressources that will give me money laughing out loud like thats the only issue I cant get a student loan because of a stupid tax thing that has nothing to even do with me and then I was thinking I guess I could move back in with my parents but I have a lease amd ink if ill be able to find anyone to sublet my apartment like im trying to figure it out but unfortunately I dont have the time and now its too late I ruined everything its the stupidest hardest thing ive ever been through and I cant stoo crying be im a worthless piece of shit who cant do anything, right? The worst part is that ive never been able to stick with anything especially not school and I thought it would be different this time be I wanted it more but clearly that wasnt enough anyways I appreciate anyone who took the time to read that thats shits crazy

You are not worthless or lazy, or anything of the things you have been telling yourself, you are working really hard, too hard and you are not coping, but you have got some good ideas in your post to make this easier for yourself. Moving back in with your parents or doing fewer hours on your program, you could even do both. What I would suggest is apologising to your supervisor, telling them the program is really important to you. Telling them that you have a plan and asking to defer until you have sorted things out. It does not hurt to ask. The worst they can do is say, no, I really hope this helps. It sucks that you are in a situation where you are having to support yourself and study at the same time, but you sound really determined and you have still got some good options

Title: Generalised anxiety disorder patient between psychiatrists.
Thread
I got into a massive pit of legal trouble and almost went to jail for reasons that I will not elaborate on here suffice to say both the experts who reported to the court and to a lesser extent the court saw how remorseful I was and mandated I go to a psychiatrist this was the first time I learned why I was constantly throwing up on people who asked me what I was eating and then answering their own question with something that disgusts me or feeling like I was about to get a punch in the head when someone such as a teacherconfusion was complimenting me from a position where I could not see them in to first the good doctor starts me on medications that stabilise my feelings and make me feel like I could walk down the street without readying myself for a big fight not directly from his mouth, but on paper I learn that I have been diagnosed with generalised anxiety disorder. I was taken off the first medication he prescribed, paxilconfusion, and I relearned what was gone from my life. I reported to him every so often and during the time that I was in the once every three days stage of titration down, I reported to him that a character in a streaming show was making me want to teleport into the to and do horrible things to him. So he told me to just switch to the brintellix and keep out of contact with people other thanDisability support workers fast forward a week and I do not even feel like I am on medications anymore I am taking them because I never want to go back to what I will be feeling if I stop taking them but this psychiatrist is no longer available to me he is basically retiring and I need a discharge summary from him before I can get a referral to a service that will send my to a psychiatrist that I can afford. Ie I do not have to pay any money for it is all the responsibility of the government, and I am just going to ignore the emotional flare up that prompted if it takes a village to raise a child it takes a village to abuse oneconfusion. This is the second time in the space of about eighteen months that a support like this. The other one being the best psychologist I ever metconfusion has been torn out from under me. But I am starting to wonder why this happens to me so much. Thank you.

Title: Not sure how to continue.
Thread
Ever since I was a small child, I have had anxiety and depression. I thought it would change as I have gotten older, but it hasnt, as is the same for many. The pandemic has set me back a lot in relation to my mental health. Most days, I do not feel like I can continue, but I do. Lately, I have been thinking a lot about why I do. My mind has been telling me I cannot go on for about years, yet here I am. I am on medication. I have talked to doctors and therapists. What is the next step? A lot of stress comes from my job, but if I leave it, everything will fall apart. Maybe that is what I need to rebuild, quit, my job, lose my entire life, basically, and check into some type of hospital. It is so hard to fight my own brain every single day. If anyone has been where I am and has any advice, I would really appreciate it. Thank you.

Very well written it a primal need. Most people feel most people have this need covered or so it seemsconfusion, and thus it can feel harder than it is. Just hang in there unless there are real life changes you can make. That increases the odds of you meeting someone you have to live and hope it happens. Good luck, my bro.

I so badly just want someone to love me and for me to love them. Yup, I know what you mean. Thing is loving someone entails loving them for who they are. There are an enormous number of people out there who cannot do that. I am drowning in such people for what it is worth. You have to take care that people who say they love you are not just using that to lead you around by the nose.

Those chest aches are the worst, makes you feel so empty and just wanting to hold someone you seem like a sweet person. And I can see things are really hard right now, but one day that special person is going to come and sweep you off your feet until then you reap what you sew give out love and do not give up on it. Youre worthy of it all.

I not proud of anything I do anymore. When I do something I should be proud of. I do not feel anything. I feel so numb. I get frustrated at the fact that I just feel absolutely nothing. I should be proud of myself. I should be happy, but I just not no matter what, I cant escape constant reminders of everything I did not do, everything I failed to achieve. I feel like such a fake. I act like I kind to other people. I act like I all that when, really, I just doing it to feel better about myself. I just I feel stupid. I feel like a fool. I do not even know who I am anymore. I ve been constantly labeled as the smart kid in class all my life, but now I do not even know what I doing anymore. I do not want to try in school anymore, because I feel dumb. I feel like everyone else is better than me, so I do not even want to try. I get overwhelmed with easy assignments, and so I give up. And even when I finally get myself to try, I cannot help but feel like I ve still failed. I feel pathetic. I hate myself more than anything I looked at myself in the mirror and I felt nothing. I feel so lonely. I wish I could, though, love me. Love being me. If I could, I would love myself more than anything for the rest of my life.I feel like people who are able to love themselves completely whole unconditionally are so incredibly lucky to have such an ability.

We re in the same boat, and that is why it hurts to read this. It really does look. I am not going to say comforting words here, because it is not going to get us anywhere. I want to be real with you. As a person who used to hate every fiber of himself, I would not say that I love myself or even like myself. But at this point in time, I at least do not hate myself. I want you to know that what I did may not fully apply to you, but it may at least help. Firstly, you have to start acknowledging that all of this negativity does not matter and you should not let it eat you out. Everyone else expectation of you are irrelevant. You are what you make of yourself. And if you feel as if what you are doing is not that glamorous start to learn how to appreciate the smaller things that you do or do not do, make an effort to progressively acknowledge what makes you who you are and like it at the same time. Secondly, invest your time on yourself more than other people exercise, learn something new, pursue a hobby or even pick up a hobby you have already write or draw. The point is, do whatever that may help you. Invest more in you. If you feel fake by acting kind to other people to make yourself feel better, do not interact with them for a while until that kindness ofYours becomes genuine. Invest the time that you use to being kind towards them and apply it to yourself. Instead if you feel guilty that you are not spending as much time with those people, I suggest telling them the reason why you aren. If you do, you may even get moral and emotional support. Thirdly, learn who you are from an outsider perspective. I think you dwell often about the titles people give you or what you accustom yourself to acting as for their sake. Look what they see or expect from you is, again irrelevant. You have to find out who you are more and more. What I did to learn about myself. More is dedicating half an hour or a full hour alone, fully isolated in a quiet place, all for yourself to think about yourself and then write it down. I really hope this may somehow help you if it doesn. It might be worth a shot to take therapy. You can make it through this. I believe in you

Don be so hard on yourself. Everyone goes through life differently. The only person you should worry about competing with is yourself.

Title: I have been severely depressed that past few weeks and I am out of ideas.
Thread
Some days are better than others. I do not feel sad every day, but it is damn near impossible for me to feel happy. I am generally a pretty happy person, but I have just been finding it so difficult to enjoy anything. Nothing bad has happened to me recently. Life is actually going pretty well, but I do not find enjoyment in anything. I do not want to be around anyone. Nothing is interesting, and life just seems like it is a mundane experience as a whole. Now, the only solution people give me is therapy, and that is just not an option for me. In my current situation, the options seem to be either therapy or suicide, and I am really trying to avoid the latter. Any advice would be appropriated. I am bow. Thanks.

Title: I have done everything I can to help my depression yet I still feel the same way.
Thread
I recently was hospitalized for being depressed. I voluntarily went. Let me be clear I was not suicidal. I just needed more support than therapy and the medicine. Now, almost days after my stay, im feeling the exact same way I have tried, reaching for help in every possible way I can. I have a therapist that I see regularly. I take my meds as prescribed, almost never miss a dose. My meds have been changed multiple times over the years, been through the hospitalization process, looked up and tried many methods to help depression and lack of motivation, and still nothing. I dont feel any different. I feel so lost. I dont know what to do anymore. At this point, I just want to rot in my bed. I just need some advice on what to do. Now, some info. Im a I live in the us, im in university currently, I have really crappy insurance

Its not just meds and therapy that helps with depression, its also your mindset and will power. I have depression, too, and it might not be as severe as yours. So this is purely my experience. Maybe it will work, or maybe it wont. My therapist told me that even on my worst days, I need to keep doing the mundane things, like brushing, taking a shower. Eating doesnt have to be everything, but a couple of things, it tricks your brain into feeling mundane. So to say, she also told me to never stop engaging with people and in my hobbies. If I do not feel like doing one thing, then do something else and so forth. But to keep doing something, sometimes you just have to force yourself to be happy or normal, at least my therapist and psychiatrist has helped me a lot. Maybe you should try looking for a new therapist. I hope you feel better soon we are in the same boat, and I wish you all the best

Title: Anxiety attacks and emotional intelligence.
Thread
I am looking for advice. I realized recently that the first thing to go when I enter into an anxiety attack or a long stretch of anxiety, is my emotional intelligence. I am right away offended by everything my loved ones say I am not happy if they cannot respond to me. When I try to reach out, I can become jealous. I am defensive. When I do not really need to be. Is this normal? Any advice on how to break out of that pattern?
Comments
Think about it this way. When anybody is especially stressed, angry, anxious, sad, frightened, etc. Are they in a good spot to make great life decisions that account for all possible pros and cons? Probably not what could help is figuring out ways to cope with your anxiety and to work to more quickly regulate your emotions and get back to baseline. There are tons and tons of tips out there. It is a matter of trial and error to figure out what will work for you. Good luck.

Title: How do I deal with the intense envy that is ruining my headspace?
Thread
There are two guys I know who are much younger than me but have achieved a lot more already. They are raw, talented, confident and possess leadership skills. It seems as if everyone is in awe of them. If they do an internship, the employer gives rave reviews. If they help an elderly couple with tough calculations, that couple treats them like their grandkids. If they do a job, they become a senior. After just a year of work, they have started to keep all shit together at such a young age, and I am near opposite. I lack the confidence to look people in their eyes. I can lose my current job at any time, which is paying me just enough to survive their respective months. I am shit when compared to these youngsters, how do I get rid of these feelings that are ruining every single day of mine?

I have been in therapy for around months trying to understand why I lose physical interest in every female. I want to have a relationship with it. Not that my sex drive is low. I am turned on by practically anything. It is just that pretty quickly, after I start dating someone and we get together, I lose all interest, even if I like her, I feel like I get that.

Look into avoidant attachment style. It could be fueling why you feel like that.

Title: I feel like im losing myself.
Thread
Theres someone close to me. Were not that close, but we have some of the same friends. We have the same exact name, the same kind of interests, its all the same. Yet, I am worse at everything. Theyare younger, then me. And I have probably been doing most of these things for longer. I struggle with making new friends and talking to people, yet it is so easy for them. They are so pretty, too. Their eyes, their nose and even their side profile is so nice. I know that when people say my name, they are not talking to me. Its like I have grown accustomed to no one using my name, but lately it has gotten worse. Its like I am starting to feel like I am not me, maybe that I am like the shadow of her. I just feel like im not me, even she has made a nickname for me. We joke around that I stole her name and she stole mine, but I am kind of starting to believe it. I know it kind of doesnt make sense, but I cant really put it into words either. Shes kind of just taking over, like, taking my friends everything, my skills, too. I like music, but she likes it more. Then me. I like anime. She likes it more than me. It really is like shes just greater at everything she does. I was not confident in the first place. But this kind of just makes it so much worse.I had though I was better at something than her so I asked a friend if they knew how good she was at it and shes great so much better then I am. Anyways. This was kind of just a lot of nothing. But tell me if you have experienced something like this

Title: Overly self awareness.
Thread
Since I was about, I started to notice I sense of self awareness when I was able to separate my parents personalities, along with characteristics, ideas and feels that we share. Unfortunately, I picked up a lot of their mental health issues, as well as my own personal problems and overtime. I been able to separate and analyze, and for the most part, managed most of my mental illness out of pure will, power and understanding of the situation. At I was given the option that I might be functioning, autistic or asperger. And after a couple months of research, I would say it fit the bill at the moment. I am in the middle of get reevaluated if it comes back to be. So then that just confirms the accuracy of my self awareness. But at the same time, I makes me feel more alone, knowing that it is rare, the find others that might understand what is goin on in my head. I feel very out of place in most events, and no matter how I explain, then idea does not go thru. So I developed social anxiety cause I do not think people care for the most part, but I do not let it bother me, because it is just how my life is. And there not much I can do right now till I can get I better understanding.

Title: Need help figuring out if I could have mommy daddy issues or not.
Thread
Please hear me out. Hear? I want to preface this by saying, my parents are actually alright parents, they are not abusive and are trying their best anyway on to the rest of the post. I believe I may have something akin to mommy issues. When I was younger, they got me to do the same set of chores constantly, which, due to then undiagnosedconfusion adhd, I would rarely complete to their expectations if at all, as such, they would go on at me for a little while, sometimes comparing me to other kids. They know who could always do way better, etc. Sometimes to themselves, when they were younger and how they always did the jobs quick and to standard. This, of course had some impact on my sense of self worth, and made me feel like a burden to be around and take care of. Now, all of that makes sense to me. But one thing I have noticed that I am wondering may be linked, is the following. I rarely feel an emotional connection to my parents, both of them tbe not just mumconfusion. I do not remember feeling much of anything towards them for a very long time. I would like to clarify. This does not mean I feel nothing if they were to drop dead tomorrow, I would be distraught. However, I believe I do not feel what many people who have what il call a totally normal upbringing as normal as you can get. I guessconfusion, basically, I feel almostNo bond with my mother in day to day life, even though she was actually there like she technically, was there. But in regards to my psychological state, she, functionally, wasnt. I have looked up some of the symptoms of mummy issues and emotional neglect, and I think some of them apply the wording is very vague, and the bit of asd that I have is not helping. Could anyone please help me figure out or explain some of the symptoms so I can better figure stuff out, feel free to ask for extra info or clarifications. I believe red rejection, sensitive dysphoriaconfusion from my adhd would have definitely played a role in this. I also believe, at some point I kind of felt like I did not deserve her love because of constantly being criticised, but not really being told how to make amends for what she was criticising me, overconfusion, but to a low intensity. If that makes sense. But I cannot be sure, right now need more time to think that part over. And remember back a few years,

Title: Does depression anxiety cause self centeredness
Thread
Basically my sister is extremely self centered she only ever talks about herself and her interests and never thinks to ask me a thing about myself half the time. I think she forgets I have a job as she tries to make plans with me in the middle of the day and she often leaves my messages unresponded to but continues sending me videos of her cats. I am constantly disappointed by our conversation. I even try to give her easy tid bits about my life thinking she would ask something more about it. But instead she goes on about herself. Something I said reminded her about something in her life. I notice she is easier to have a conversation with when she is in a better mood, but this is rare, and when we do not live together, she never checks in on me or my family except to send videos or to complain about her life. If she were not my sister and just a regular friend, I would probably just let our friendship drift off and not want to be friends with her. Honestly, I have brought it up to her a few times, but she usually gets defensive and angry at me. I know she is going through a lot right now. She been diagnosed with an ed anxiety depressionconfusion. So in some ways, I want to just cut her some slack, but she is also just always been like this, and only in the last few years have I become consciousOf it, I do not know how to even bring this up in a way she would understand, or if it would just drive her away from me, or if this is just how she is, you know, do mental illness and self centeredness go together? Is this a product of her mental health or just her personality?
Comments
From personal experience I think they are probably related now whether or not she is purposefully doing it is something I would not know since I do not know her personally. But for me I was severely depressed from around to basically last year im about to turn now and still moderately depressed if that makes any differenceconfusion. I never even noticed it until about years ago that I would do that exact same thing and I had to really work on breaking that habit. I think in my head I was just desperate for someone to notice me and show me a form of care and love that I was craving, and because of that I would try and have as much attention as possible I would somehow turn conversations back to myself and somehow I could make anything about me in some way. I do not think I was doing it on purpose because there were times that I would notice people being annoyed by it, and I would be genuinely confused as to why they were upset, and my brain would turn it around to somehow thinking they do not care about me, and it would in turn cause a vicious cycle. The crazy thing is, I had a friend who was also severely depressed, who would do the same thing, and I would get annoyed by it, and I could not understand that I was doing the exact same. So two years ago, I had a sort of realization. I have noIdea how or why it came to me after so many years, but I finally understood that it was driving people away or making them miserable to be around me. I started noticing that when I was with people, I would bring the mood down. And at first I was in a little bit of denial, but it finally clicked that it was not anyone elses fault but mine. So I was not doing it intentionally to be a narcissist. I was just so desperate that I thought that was the only way again I do not know your sister, so maybe she has a different personality where she might have selfish tendencies, but do not we allconfusion or I think she might just be seeking a certain form of attention that she does not know how to ask for in a healthy way. I totally understand now how hard it is to be around that. And I wish you the best of luck. My best advice would be to mention it to her gently, maybe bring up the fact that you care for her and love her. But you wish she showed interest into your life too, and hopefully shel be able to view the situation from your eyes and see how it can be harmful to you too. And another thing is, if she does eventually realize it and wants to make the steps to be less self centered, be patient, I am still trying to work on it even two years later, andIt is hard. Its like breaking a habit that you have had for years, and sometimes you slip. I sometimes find myself starting to turn a conversation to make it about me, and I have to put a bit of extra effort in to remind myself it is not always about me, so I would imagine it would take a while for her to do the same. Feel free to reach out to me anytime if you need anything.

Title: Antidepressant help.

Hi guys. So I went to my go today and she prescribed be my of prozac. I need some thoughts, as google is making me scared to take them. I recently had a really bad depressive episode that lasted around weeks and ended maybe a week ish ago this has happened a lot throughout where I would go weeks being depressed and then maybe a week or so of feeling completely fine right now I feel like I am not in one of my depressive episodes and I almost feel like maybe I do not need antidepressants. But whenever I am in a depressive episode, I always regret not getting medication. Now my question is it unsafe to take them when not feeling entirely depressed? I am just so confused, because a week ago, I literally wanted to unlive myself and did not leave my room. But now I literally am feeling fine and am not sure if I am being dramatic, but you all, I do this everytime I think it went away, and then it comes crawling back anywayy. I just do not want to ruin my brain. Any help would be very appreciated red heart

Hi, millions of people safely take prozac everyday. It perfectly fine to take it, even if you are not feeling depressed right now. And as it takes weeks to be fully effective, you do not want to wait until your next depressive episode to start.

Title: Am I overworking myself?
Thread
Hi. So when it comes to prioritizing my mental health, I am not the best, and I could use some advice. So I started a project out of personal passion last year, and I came in very passionate, working about hours day for days week, while managing school and other priorities. Eventually, in, like september, I noticed my motivation decreasing, but I kept pushing. I am now at the stage where I want to work, but I cannot get my mind to work. I cut down to hours day, but even that makes me feel overwhelmed. Am I overworking myself? I want to take a long break. But when I do, I feel like I am wasting time and neglecting my project. Even though I cannot get myself to work. I do love this and do not want to neglect it. Any advice would be appreciated

Title: I am unmotivated.
Thread
Hey guys, I need some opinions. I have been working as a dev for about years. I am on my third company, and I am completely out of motivation. About year ago, I changed companies because I was in the same situation as I am now unmotivated, unwilling to do anything, I just make mistakes in the code, etc. Confusion. And I changed companies because I thought the problem could be the project that I was after year. And I find myself even worse. I hate the project I am on. I just want to leave the area. My job sucks. I have too much free time, and I could use it to learn, improve my skills, but I do not do anything. I just look at the pa. I wah. And im alone. Most of the day, my girlfriend arrives at the afternoonconfusion, and I think thats even worse. Has anyone gone through the same? Is it better to go talk to a professional
Comments
Sounds like you lack any satisfaction in your work a feeling of accomplishment can go a long way in helping with motivation you can try to set goals for yourself get amount of work done focus on today etc confusion to help with feeling accomplished or reward yourself once you reach those goals do something you enjoy after

Yes, do seek some help for mental health. Also from work point of view, try a related but different field, like automation, testing, maintenance of in production projects. If you think development work is getting too much.

Title: Does self harm have to be intentional or can it be only subconscious?
Thread
I ask be there are many things in my life you could count as self harm, but I have to admit, I never really got the point behind self harm. I mean, I am in a bad situation, and hurting myself will not fix that or make anything better. If I would ever do self harm, I would do it properly, aka kill myself. But that is not a problem. Rnconfusion as to some of the things I do that may be self harm. I neglect my own interests or wishes, mostly not to stand out or offend anyone. I do not wear proper clothing, a thin jacket when it is snowy. Outsideconfusion. I really do not care about hygiene. I shower thrice a week, never use or used. Deo do not style my hairconfusion. None of that happens with the intension. Yea, this will harm me or make me suffer or seth
Comments
It can be both. Failure to take care of yourself is innately harmful, like if you forget to eat for a few days or do not drink water, its self sabotage. We have to make an active effort to be healthier since we are starting at a mental disadvantage. I hate putting forth this effort and do not shower much either. So no shameconfusion.

Title: Advice.
Thread
I am not exactly sure where to start with this. I normally do not talk about it, thinking back as far as I can remember. I cannot recall a single instance where I felt empathy for anyone. I have spent most of my life observing and reacting in a way that will receive the least amount of complications. The older I get, the more I see people around me experiencing joy, sadness and anger. But I view it as nothing more than clockwork. Its all actions and reactions, chemicals firing in the brain and not personal at all. I hate saying this out loud, but viewing life in this way makes it incredibly easy to manipulate any situation to get whatever outcome I want out of people. I do my best to avoid doing this, not necessarily because I feel guilty, but because I do not want to deal with any sort of confrontation, if it was to ever be revealed that I was doing it. Its difficult to explain, but I am concerned for my lack of concern. Its more of an uncomfortable awareness that I do not feel, emotion. I do not get that burn in my chest when I am angry, I just lazily portray some sort of anger. So my response fits in with the situation, but I am not actually upset. I smile when people around me smile, but I do not feel any sort of joy. I laugh when people laugh, but I am not amused. Its always one ofThe hardest things to talk about because when you are talking to a friend about how you feel no empathy or emotion they take it so personally it is not that I have some sort of disdain for people I would love to be able to see somebody be upset and to be upset with them or someone be excited about something good and get excited with them but it is so foreign to me and it does not make sense I have spent most of my life just sliding through situation after situation and playing it like a game in such a way that results in the least amount of complications I want to feel emotion I want to be upset I want to be happy I want to be sad I am just not exactly sure what I am doing that is making that so hard I feel completely indifferent like I am in limbo and do not exactly know what to do

Title: My mom thinks I should keep my mental health issues to myself.

Comments
One thing I need to point out first, autism is not something you have. My generalised anxiety used to rise up like a cobra and bare its fangs at such phrasing. It still does, but not so badly that I spent the subsequent weeks to months with my fists clenched and my teeth wearing down to nubs. Now I have been misdiagnosed so many times that I have jumped up and down and shouted for help in mounting a case against my local hospital for libel. Per. In other words, I do not have to prove why or how the false diagnosis is damaging to me just that the diagnosis is falseconfusion. So I understand the fear of misdiagnosis, but your mother is saying things that would make me wonder if perhaps she has some issues of her own set up and go to an appointment explain your fears clearly and be honest with them. They are there first and foremost to help you. If you are afraid, they will do something dishonest that will hurt you secretly record the conversations until you are not afraid about that anymore. If people are dishonest and or hurtful, having a candid record of what you both said is a big help when trying to expose them confusion and never be afraid to ask questions, you have to do what is right for you and your mother is not doing the right thing for you.

I dont know the extent of your story, but in a way, your mother is right you do not want to tell people too much and have your life jeopardised, but also you would probably be fine going to see someone professional. It is not like they are all linked and out to get you or have to report things unless it is something extreme. You should go and talk to someone if you think it will help. You can also do many things in your life on your own to improve your situation, like excersizing and connecting with friends.

Your mum wrong. The only reason your child might be taken from you is if they are in danger from your comment below, it does not sound like that is likely. But the thing with mental health is it can get worse, which is more likely if you do not seek help. I understand your mum concerns, but it does not sound like she has a good grip on mental health issues and is either feeding off or feeding into stigma. If you have got access, you should definitely get professional help.

Keeping your mental health to yourself is a fast way to getting yourself killed or having you lash out on others. Its okay to be upset, to cry and to talk about how you feel.

Title: Sometimes I feel if my brain or mind is its own thing.

Sometimes it feels like I have no control over it kind of like having another person in your body or voices in your head. It sometimes tells me stuff to do or controls aspects of my mind. A few days ago, it prevented me from having a certain dream that I wanted to have. But I cannot, because with says, I do not deserve it. I talked to my brother about it, but he does not really know. It could just be me talking down on myself. My self confidence is already in the shitterconfusion, but it feels like someone else is talking to me. A voice I have no control in. I would, some research, but I could not really find anything. I came just to see if other people would know what it is, so I can treat it

I know what you mean pay no attention, find silence and peace within it is kind of being in the present, being in a meditative state of mind. It is impossible to describe how to deal with this, but hopefully you find your way. Do not listen to. People, do not believe in shit, experience, experiment. Find your own truth. Do not cling to it. Reality evolves too. We all change things, change things you used to think. Az real can become lies in the next day. It is difficult for me as well, but I am getting there. Hope I helped a little is you are not insane. It is just something you have to deal with, but does not make you any less nor any better

A brain can be a real asshole sometimes telling stuff that is not true and just feels bad. But I have to admit, I never saw a case like yours where the brain is more like a different persona. Plus, seek professional help, a therapist, psyocholgist, seth, like, thatconfusion esp. Since noone else seems to be able to help you with that matter.

So long story short, I have been suffering from depression for few months now, and I was also in relationship. She supported me a lot. I felt like dying, but talking to her everyday made me feel better and not do anything, but still used to feel like that sometimes. But days ago, my life changed completely, like, totally my of. Now, my ex revealed she is been cheating on me from past month and broke up and tbe. I am completely destroyed. I am not able to focus on anything. Worst part is I still love her and it hurts and now I just cry too bad. I have no one. I cannot share anything with anyone. I just badly want someone to be with me and love me. I really beg someone to just support. Even a friend would be fine. My relationship got over and I am not desperate to start another so soon, but I just want someone to support me. I am sure I am going to probably end up taking my life sooner or later. I cannot stop crying, went to a therapist too, did not helped much. I just want it to get better, but it is not getting any better. It is hurting. I feel like someone is taking life away from and slowly ripping my chest off. Please someone save me

What truly unfortunate is that we are all alone inside ourselves. Only you are and only you can be responsible for your own emotional well being there no one coming to save you because it just does not work that way. People can love on you support you and understand you but no one except you can save you.

It just an matter of time till you find someone new, and most likely better. In the meantime, work on your depression. Suppose you could win a prize by hitting a target with an arrow, and the arrows were free. If somebody asked, how many arrows do you want? You would not say, which is the best one. Youd say, how many can I have? The beauty of self help is that you have a variety of low cost, low risk things that can be combined with each other and with standard treatments with office visits. While it is not clear at this time that any one of these things is as effective as an antidepressant, it is common sense that if a variety of reasonably good things are combined with each other, they will have considerable effect. I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below, details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also, traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this one practical advice for motivation, very important

Comments
Relaxation is one of the things recommended for stuttering a very simple but effective method for calming down is simply to breathe slowly this is used for treating panic disorder and ptsd three ways for treating social anxiety with slow breathing at home get good and relaxed then imagine the feared situation start with something fairly easy and in future sessions imagine more challenging situations learn to associate relaxation with the situation use slow breathing in the minutes before the feared situation use slow breathing during the situation two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise breaths a min is good and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale gently. Seconds each I pass along something a friend told me that your might find helpful. We stutterers by instinct hold in our breath before we speak. Solution exhale right before your going to have to say letters, words, you stutter it counter instinct because being intelligent, we hold in breath at a threat good normally, but we do it to excessconfusion

Didn seem like that big of a deal to me because we were not that bust, but my boss told me off and was pretty upset. Now im scared to go back cause im super embarrassed my life is already going downhill, and now im worried my boss thinks im a shitty employee. Its just not what I need right now. I feel like it is not a big deal to most people, but it is eating me alive.

I am really sorry that happened little things like this break me down too. I have social anxiety and im pretty bad at communicating. So whenever similar thing happens it feels like the end to me because I know I cannot explain myself like any normal person, and I know id feel too embarrassed to do anything about it. I end up taking it too personally and overthinking everything. I am not sure if you are asking for advice. So ignore this if you dont but would you be able to eventually gather the courage to go back to work? If yes, would it be possible to apologize to your boss and explain to them that you had an emergency or something

Title: Why is it so impossibly difficult for me to initiate anything with other people?
Thread
Like I do not understand. I have made a lot of progress on my mental state this past year, but one thing I cannot overcome is this self isolation. I desperately want to do things with people. I need to be around people. But while I know there is several I could ask to do something with. I never do it like this overwhelming, invisible wall is present, preventing me from taking action or getting out, even though I desperately want to, like, I have barely any friends. And I know that I could reach out to people whom I have not in a year or otherwise could go out and make an attempt to meet new people. But this has always been my folly. I might have a really good fun, initial interaction with someone, but I will never reach out to them again, even though I think it would be nice to hang out again. This does not even feel like anxiety ink. What the hell this is

Is it a concern that you will not be as fun the next time around my reason for my social anxietyconfusion or something else? What prevents you from calling them up and asking them out?

Title: I have a horrible anger problem not looking for a solution. This is a new way of trying to let it out.
Thread
When I get angry something inside me just is there I have no idea how to explain it ever since I was a little ass kid it is always been there its like this swirling feeling and it tingles my whole body as soon as I get pissed as something and I just have to keep letting it out on something never hurting anythingconfusion. But no matter what I have to let it out or else it stays there and I cannot live with it no matter how intense the anger is, it is always there and I cannot do anything about it its that fucking feeling I have no way of controlling it its always there when I am mad and I always have to let it out at some point. If it is not right away due to the situation, it happens later and is more severe. I do not know if this is a normal sensation or what, but it rushes through my body similarly to how you feel when you are suddenly started. But every time I am angry, if I bottle, it just gets let out eventually, just want to see if this is something anyone else on here has I doubt I can even solve this wont go to therapy, as I do not believe in it, solving anything for me.

Yes, I used to experience this. Unfortunately, therapy was what solved it for me, but I hope you find something that works for you.

Have you spoken to your doctor about this? It sounds like you might be experiencing depression. I know it is really difficult, but tackling some of the things you mentioned is likely to help you start feeling a bit better things like brushing your teeth, reaching out to your friends, going for a walk or doing some other form of exerciseconfusion.

Today I am feeling an overall sense of sadness throughout the week. My mood has been pretty dull. This is usually how it is in the winter time. But the past weeks have been especially bad. I have cried at a lot of random things this week, I am overthinking everything my partner does says I am binge eating. I am spiraling a lot of my thoughts into a bad place. I actually just joined reddit a few days ago, and I found reading a lot of different peoples posts on their own. Mental health has helped, but also, following my daily routine and hanging out with my animals, trying to still return texts from my family friends,

Confusion. I am feeling pretty overwhelmed from visiting home and seeing my parents. They are very concerned for me, which is great to have them be looking out for me. Confusion. But having to talk to them about this stuff and life in generalconfusion is exhausting. This week was on and off. I was stressed about the transition for visiting my parents because of change in environment. This led me to refuse to come home the day I was supposed to. From the panic, confusion, panic attacks, upset, stomach, irritable, tired, confusion. I have been treating myself to yoga and loose leaf teas.

I guess I will go first this week this week I have felt below average I am sad because I did not make friday plans this week a co worker asked me if I will join for drinks later. I am grateful for that, but I know that getting piss drunk will not help my mental state right now at least not long term this week, I have realised that I am soon about to have to make a major choice in my life. The plan was to move to another city sometime in the next month my sister told the family this week that she is expecting her first child and I do not know if I can bear to move away if it means that I might not be able to be there for her as much physically. I feel great this week I have eaten well and had the motivation to work out almost every day. I am trying to talk pretty openly with friends and family about how I feel. I know that my issues are not major, and there are people that are far worse off. My parents are starting to get pretty old as well. I am in my late

Currently, I feel like I am in fight or flight mode because of flashbacks I have been getting. I am still a little tired, but are trying to wake up since I have classes. Coffee has been helping out. This has definitely not been my best week, considering my mother died on the she killed herself, and I am pretty sure she mixed, starving herself with overdosing. I was the one who found her body, which makes things even more traumatic. I have somehow been super low energy and hypervigilant at the same time. I have gone back to a bar. I used to go when I was, but it has not gotten out of hand. I have not left my house in a bit since. I know I will not feel safe. As soon as I step out the door, mainly talking to my family and friends about it. They ve been a major help, since most of them can relate to how I have been feeling. On my own. I have been journaling my thoughts and making vent drawings. It been a lot more helpful than I thought it would be

Title: My mother is acting like I am the reason my father is so verbally abusive towards me, but she is literally diagnosed with depression because of him. Why?
Thread
I try to defend myself, but whenever I do, he starts screaming and yelling at me, calling me a little bitch, cunt! Fucking idiot, etc. He once threatened to strip me naked and kill me because he thought my hair was not wet enough. When I got out of the shower, I am convinced he is a sociopath. Just today, I was in the car with him and my older sister confusion, getting dinner. It was all fine until we got home I had brang the ufc up to the front door and was waiting for my father to unlock it because my hands were full and I could not carry anything else. Then my sister yells at to my father saying, I forgot my drink in the car. Out of nowhere, he starts going on a rampage, saying, I am a lazy cunt. And then going inside to scream at my mother about me. After I had finished my work outside, I walked inside to have a drink, and the first thing I hear is, why are you being such an asshole to your father? He done nothing to you and you treat him like a piece of trash, which is when I ran to my room and started crying because of how sick I am of her acting like he is the victim. When he is not. I even told her the only reason he was mad at me was because I forgot my drink. She did not care and said, it was myFault anyway I am finding it hard to still like my mother after the way she acts whenever my father acts abusive about me she used to defend me but now she just gets mad at me despite the fact that he treats her the exact same way as me and she reacts even worse than I do my sister makes it even worse most of the time she is the reason he is mad at me because she is always pointing out little mistakes I made even if the mistakes were years ago my mother has two other children with another man who died in one is and the other is turning this year around. My brother and sister had invited my father to an arm wrestle my father broke my brother hands and then yelled at him for crying because he should have known it would happen if he messed with the big boys. He denies it even happens up until this day. But I am even more mad that my mother did not break up with him. She knew the way my father would treat his future children and still decided to raise my sister and I with him. Even though he was very obviously a bad person, he was into drugs he would steal money from cars, he even chopped off his cousins finger. And then like decades later, when that same cousin spoke up about her father raping her, my father called her a liar and a bitch and convinced theEntire family. She was lying about rape. When I asked him how he knew she was lying, his response was, well, you know, rapists nameconfusion is not like that. He a good guy. People who knew jeffery, dahmer, ivan milan and ted bundy thought they were good guys as well. I forgot to add, I am nearly. I know my age makes a lot of people think I am a liar.

Hey I just want to start by saying that I dont understand your situation to the fullest extent my mother realizes my dad is the issue in our arguments but still pressures me to be better however, I can realize that your mother is definitely attached to him for one reason or another im not sure how to get out of this situation as they are your parents and you cant legally leave them for another years about verbal abuse is definitely something that can hurt a kid in ways physical never could. It messes you up mentally, which stays with you for your entire life. Id recommend finding friends who you can talk to at school or maybe if theres a counselor if it comes to it, cops defs could do something, but I dont know if you would be willing to go there. I can say that based on how your mother seems to be attached to him, even if he is brought out of your life, youre likely to be blamed. I hate to say that. But that situation would also suck. I dont know if youve tried to talk to your mom about this yet, but when youre comfortable, you may want to try that he is definitely extremely toxic. But considering hes your guardian, theres next to nothing you can do. Unfortunately, hopefully, this has brought something positive to the situation you are in. And I can understand being forced go change to make somebody else happy in your family.

I often prepare food for myself but also make foods that I know my loved one enjoys, and then tell them I made too much, and if they would like some, I also sometimes tell them I am putting something in the oven for myself and ask them if they want me to throw something for them in. Even if I am not actually cooking something for myself at allconfusion, it can take the pressure off of them, which can also take the guilt away if they are worried about being a burden.

My friend used to ask, what have you eaten today as a way also, maybe instead of daily asking if they have taken their meds, ask them to start texting you when they have so, like, have them text you hey, I took them today after they did and maybe check up at the end of the day. If you did not get that text. Thats a routine. You have to ask them to do, though you should not just start it without asking.

Instead of, did you eat today? You could ask what they had for breakfast, lunch, dinner, depending on time of dayconfusion. If you ask about lunch, for example, and they say they did not have anything, you could follow up with something like, oh, big breakfast with meds. It is a little trickier. Maybe something like, are the meds helping today? Or simply, did you remember to take your meds? I have also heard people use vitamins as a euphemism, which some people like, but might annoy others, depends on your person, really, I think just taking a genuine interest in what someone is going through is huge tbe. I do not know what your friend is struggling with, but genuine human connection and caring almost always helps

I ask my partner what have you eaten today every day when his appetite goes, then I make yummy stuff and take pictures of it and invite him over if I do not have it in me to cook or whatever I followup what did you eat by asking him what he has and casually talk about what I would make with that and say that he would probably do it differently which, of course he would. He tells me how he would improve upon my idea, or maybe he has a totally different ideaconfusion. And I argue that it would not even be good that way, and he would be outraged and make it. And let me know how wrong I am. Other times I just describe food in my waitress. Voice like, I am just so hungry, I have to describe food in my after sale upscale. Im casually describing this dish with unnecessary but casual and therefore unsuspecting finesse. Voice the thats a good choice. I always order that on my break when I dont order the upscale, blah, buttery finish. Blah. Voice. And I usually describe something that can be made with what he has. He probably told me what he had yesterdayconfusion that usually will pique his interest in making what I have described even hours later as for meds. I do not really press him. He is the one who got me in treatment. I know he has one round left of the same treatments I was prescribed. He hadTo do. I have to do confusion, but he has not done it because he got busy, and he is not dealing with the same stressors. So things are a lot easier for him at the moment than they were when he began treatment. I also do not think it is my business to say youre unmedicated right now. And that is the problem. I think the problem is often very multifaceted, and that medicalizing matters that sincerely weigh on a persons spirit, for example, can be counterproductive. But I can admit to this view being culturally informed if it is specifically a situation where a person is committed to a drug regimen but is having issues with followthrough that they wish they were not having. Like, for example, I have missed properly, pre scheduling my ride to some of my treatments, I have to schedule business hours in advanced, which are typically, and that is how I receive my medication. So if I am going through a particularly hard time and I forget to schedule next mondays appointment before the previous wednesday, that is no good. Other times, I purposefully change my schedule because the meds I am on have a dissociative effect, and I do not want to feel drowsy or even high be. Sometimes it is like that tooconfusion throughout so much of the week, I think it is up to me to balance those decisions, whereas I have a cousin who, if he skips his meds, will most likely experience delusions. SomePeople have dangerous delusions. So I think it is a case by case thing, but if I was struggling to make my appointments for meds and involved my partner in that, I would ask him to remind me, within a certain timeframe, if I am asking my cousin I do so directly. Did you miss, take your meds? Or did you get your meds on time? Sometimes he takes half an hour to answer. I suspect he is taking them then, but cannot focus to actually administer them, because he is already out of it.

You can always ask if it is unwelcome, you can give a short explanation and ask if they have a preference on how it is asked.

I confusion feel like I mic personality. I do not feel like a person myself. I feel like im made up of other people. I do have some views myself and some morals, but not many. I feel like I base myself off of other people. I make myself into one person made of multiple different people. When I meet people that I like love, I take their personality and make it my own. I say what they say, laugh, how they laugh and do what they do. The only acceptation is if I feel like I do not want to do what they do, which is rare, as said, I do not have my many acceptions myself. When I meet new people, I take my surface of personalities and I blank it. I go off of the person that they give me and I persue it from there. I feel like I disassociate from people and problems in my life. I take things and I shove them down into my memories or brain, and I forget about them. I feel like I could spend a few days without a person and forget about them forever. I could forget about everything that we did together until I really wanted to remember. If I really tried, I could bring memories up. But if not, then I could forget completely

This is very common for people to do op and on its own, it is not a sign of anything being wrong with you. However, if it is connected to other issues you are having that are negatively affecting your quality of life. It is very possible you may be struggling with something mental health wise. I personally struggle with pretty severe social anxiety, ptsd and dissociation, and have had to force myself to basically mic other people around me to fit in. I feel disconnected, and I am always aware that I am attempting to mic people. I feel as if I am being judged and hated. I feel like a robot. When things get too stressful, I go into autopilot and feel as if I am not really there, which makes me forced to work even harder at picking others. I may pick up another person personality in order to get through the days. I cannot really remember who I am from depression, emotional blunting there could be so many things causing this to happen for you, op and unfortunately, a lot of mental illnesses can cause emotional blunting and issues with dissociation. Many mental illnesses can also effect your working and short term memory severely, and I mean, severely. I was personally just diagnosed with literal cognitive impairment. Brain damage because of my diagnoses. People with severe anxiety disorders can experience all of these things same with people with borderline personality disorder. Many often have trouble with knowing who they are and formingAn identityconfusion or depression is keep in mind that a lot of people may have one or two traits from certain mental illnesses but that does not mean that you have that actual illness. It extremely important that you look into speaking to a professional if possible if you feel like something is wrong, that is reason enough to go in because it is actively effecting the way you live your life.

Interesting. Thank you for sharing. Do you have an example of shoving people down into your memories also, when you are not with other people, what do your thoughts sound like? Are they thoughts that the other people you have knownconfusion would have thought of? Or are they your thoughts?

Title: Is there something wrong with me or the environment I am?
Thread
I think ive always had this feeling, but it is only recently ive recognized. It feels like there is a divide between me and everyone around me. I picture a river where I am on one side, and everyone else is on the other side. The river is getting larger. Most ignore my side of the river or just glance at it. Some are willing to cross over, but they never stay for long. Most of the people who have crossed over are nothing like me. They are extroverted, judgmental, and I do not have the same interest as them, but for the time being, they are all I have except for my family until they decide to leave. I cannot find anyone who shares my interest at school and are not judgmental. Ive tried crossing the river, but it just does not work out. I cannot make any friends. How this startetongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry when I was younger, there was never a river. I was extroverted, but I could not read social cues. I realized that there was a girl trying to befriend me, but at the time, I thought she was being rude, she was, but I do not think she meant harmconfusion than it grew into actual bullying. She was influential and associating with me was considered unpopular. I felt isolated, and now it still affects me. Im now the quit kid I cannot exactly shake off the label. It feels like someone shoved tape down myThroat than ripped out my voice box for a few days. It hurt seeing people talking, interacting with their friends a few times ive given up on trying to make friends, but I keep thinking, what if I could go to the movie theaters with someone or discuss about our favorite shows and theorize about them? I am. And I guess I can always go to another school or try again if I make it to collage ink, I guess I feel like holding this in is unhealthy. I suppose the end question is there something wrong with me or the environment I am in now that you know, the full story to the question, sorry for hammer and spelling mistakesconfusion.

Everything has gone bad since the beginning. I cannot remember any time that I have felt purpose, not when I was a toddler a child a teen, nothing. I feel like my mind has been dead for years, and I am empty. I cannot hear much thought anymore. I cannot care about the people I love most. I only act according to common sense and morals, and my memory is bad. I forget a lot of things people have told me it is simply because I do not care and that I am heartless. I can tell that I am happy or sad, but only because I have started to cry or laugh, and not because I am feeling. It is not right. My mother had only told me that I am feeling dizzy, but when does this dizzy feeling go away? It has taken all of my memories and life from me. My world is not sold, it is blurry and makes no sense. I only want to be normal. I want to have a reason to be this way. I am so ashamed to ask for psychology as I am only, and I do not want to disappoint my family any longer. But I am so afraid that one day I will give up

Title: Any tips for pandemic stress.
Thread
I have been having a hard time for the past two years like a lot of peopleconfusion, but especially lately, because im about to graduate college in may. My first semester of college was awesome, and I made so many new friends and was going out a lot. Then the pandemic hit and I have not done anything since. I have hardly even gone to restaurants. My mom battled breast cancer lately, and because of her health, ive taken the pandemic very seriously. I obviously want to stay healthy too. I lost all of my friends be. We were all online for a while, and then ive been quarantining. The only person I ever talk to is my roommate, but she is in her room most of the time. I recently turned and have not gotten to have any fun, nor do I have any friends anymore to go out with, even if I wanted to. I feel silly for even wanting to go out, because obviously my moms health is much more important than me having fun. I think it is just hitting me harder now, because im going to graduate soon, and it is supposed to be the best four years of your life, and I have not had much enjoyment at all. Only stress does anyone have any tips

It is scared me see what it was doing to her. She had massive heart attack because of the medication my mother took medication to deal a my grandma death. She look so slumped and put of touch with reality, like she was not aware of what happening around her.

And my step dad does not make it any better. I do flip out because I am so angry with everything I flipped out. But the tinsel to the christmasTree was missing and I could not go to work. I felt such a need to leave the house and work my shitty mcdonald job instead of put up the christmas tree with the family. I have said this to my parents, but they do not seem to care.

So sorry what you are going through and hope you can find some ways for self improvement so that you can start fresh maybe as soon as you finish is. But to do that, well, you may need to work on your mental health some, and make sure that it does not get in the way my mother took medication to deal a my grandma death. She look so slumped and put of touch with reality, like she was not aware of what happening around her. Your mom sounds like she is over medicated, wrongly medicated or possibly abusing medications, substances. This is definitely not the desired outcome of psychiatric medication. If you are going to have some regular access to a prescribed, they can help adjust things to avoid this. Good luck.

There are no words of mine that will fix your problems overnight. However, I am really sorry. Your family life is not the best, especially with the lack of support you should be getting from your supposed loved ones. I have had a similar home life, and one thing that kept me going was holding onto something whether that be a career goal, a personal goal, or just proving to yourself that you will get through it. If no one else will say it, I will leave these words here for you. I care about you what you are going through and want the best for you in life. I guarantee you that in years time, your life will be different, and the problems you have now either will not exist or be the same ones you are dealing with. You will get past the times where you are merely surviving and you will start living

Title: Why do I keep telling people things that I know will end up with me stressed out.
Thread
There are some people in my life who I tell them something positive about my life, like how I am making progress with something important to me or something I have learned, etc. But they may disagree with what I am doing, or it ends up a whole conversation I did not want to have. Sometimes they just do not reply. We do not talk much already, but I feel almost if not totally compelled to tell them everything about my life, every little bit of progress, I do not want to do that. I want to feel comfortable knowing my progress myself and being proud of myself alone. Why do I always want to tell people, especially when it seems like a bad idea? How do I stop
Comments
Maybe you just want to hear someone say something nice to you. Its not a bad thing happy face or smiley. But if people are not responding how you would like them to maybe you could start writing a diary or something.

Title: Coping skills for a party.
Thread
My fianc is having his it day party tomorrow and it will be full of loud drinking people who I either do not know or like. My fianc said he understands I dislike parties, but it means a lot that I am there for at least hours as it will most likely go throughout the night. What tips do you have to help ease anxiety and feel emotionally safe at the party? There is only person who I know and like, but I cannot hang on her side all night nor my francs, as it would not be fair.

I was in your shoes last sunday when my bestfriend invited me over to her family party after not have seen her for years. My friend told me, im pretty sure once you get there, you will just be chilling and indeed he was right. Dont think too much about it will only make you more anxious. I would say, prepare yourself for small talk, work your confidence up and just vibe.

You can always step away for some fresh air for a while take minutes outside. Whenever you need to, you can go for a short walk around the block, visit a nearby coffee shop or just do some breathing exercises to help calm yourself down after that, you can pop back in to check with your fianc and friend repeat as needed until you are comfortable enough to call it a night youre there to support your fianc, and it is ok if you do not want to interact with everyone you being there is already a step outside of your comfort zone. So just be mindful of your self care in the meanwhile,

Title: Always felt there was nothing left front he relationship there is nothing else he actually did
Thread
I confusion feel like I mic personality. I do not feel like a person myself. I feel like im made up of other people. I do have some views myself and some morals, but not many. I feel like I base myself off of other people. I make myself into one person made of multiple different people. When I meet people that I like love, I take their personality and make it my own. I say what they say, laugh, how they laugh and do what they do. The only acceptation is if I feel like I do not want to do what they do, which is rare, as said, I do not have my many acceptions myself. When I meet new people, I take my surface of personalities and I blank it. I go off of the person that they give me and I persue it from there. I feel like I disassociate from people and problems in my life. I take things and I shove them down into my memories or brain, and I forget about them. I feel like I could spend a few days without a person and forget about them forever. I could forget about everything that we did together until I really wanted to remember. If I really tried, I could bring memories up. But if not, then I could forget completely

Title: A gentler way to ask did you eat today? Take your meds.
Thread
The title just about says it. So do you all have any advice? I know that getting hit with that question can feel shitty when you are not doing well.
Comments
I am not entirely sure I am commenting to bump the post, and also because I do have a meh idea I would personally probably say it like that just have you eaten today? But like you said that may very well feel shitty to be asked. My reasoning behind it is if I cannot find a better way to say it, I would rather make sure they are taking care of themselves and show that I care than not say anything out of fear of upsetting them. One thing I have heard is that sometimes it is ok to say things like that because these people are living in it. They deal with it anyways. So it is not like the words are the only time they will be upset by it. That does not mean it is good to say upsetting things. Softening the wording is a great idea, if possible or just knowing when to give space. What I personally would have done is probably said, I sorry if this is a bit awkward to ask, but I am worried and care about you and want you to know that I care. So I will ask, have you eaten well today? But that is a kind of meh way of saying it. I would only take that route if no one else finds a better way of saying it. I hope I can help a bit even if I have a bad way of saying it. Good luck. I hope you can findThe right way to take care of the one you love.

Perhaps you could ask is your stomach full and happy how has eating been for you today? Have you enjoyed any snacks today how are you feeling right now how is your day been going for you how your morning routine go today can pose questions in different ways of checking in regarding habits and mood can follow up with different ways you can support if needed.

If they tell you to piss off, the best way is to stop asking unless you are a professional caring from them, even a disability support worker or the like, if you are not one of those things, it is not your place to ask unless it is okay with them. I often have days where I forget my morning pills and kick myself, but I just make the people who work with me aware of it, if need be, and I feel that need very rarely.

Can relate entirely and am actively struggling with the same. I have also isolated for so long due to my mental health struggles, that committing to any amount of social interaction outside of my romantic relationship is seriously hard at this point, and I more often than not just cannot put forth the energy.

Title: My best friend chose to get laid rather than celebrate my birthday.
Thread
So for many years, I have hated my birthday. Long story short. It is never been about me due to my classmates and or family ignoring me. Something bad had always happend and shit just sucked. Last year, I went through a breakup with a previous best friend on my birthday, and it fucking sucked. My current best friend said that he promised that the next year will be better since I would live a lot closer a year passes. And a, about weeks ago, he started talking with someone who he met on tinder. I was really happy for him, and I genuinely was. Some red flags has popped up, but she seems like a cool gal, but during a talk over week ago, he mentioned that this weekend he was going to go visit her, leaving the, which is my birthday. I did not mention it at first thinking he must have forgotten. So let us see how long until he realizes he realizes it and goes very underwhelmingly in the beginning of a league of legends game. Oh, it is your birthday. That is all he says to begin with. Time goes by. I tell him, it kind of sucks. You are leaving on my day, but I want him to meet her inside of me. I really hope he chooses to be with me as he promised he can meet her. Another time, right? They just started talking. He says, he will come by in the morning after work to say hiBefore going to her place its better than nothing and I look forward to it finally the day and he does not call it gets closer to the time where he has to leave for her and he then texts me saying he will not make it. He does not even suggests that I just meet him for a bit by the train station ink why but I am just so fucking heart broken that he chose a girl he had known for less than a month over his best friend of almost years. I fucking took him for an awesome fucking tent trip in the woods because he was sad no one was celebrating him I did everything I could to make him feel as important as he is to me because he is but I feel like I am less than a random girl online there more to the story. And I know I might be selfish, but I really had hope that this year would be different. I am giving up on my birthday. Fuck this shit

Thread
I am not at my best at this time of my life mentally, financially, everythingconfusion just moved to a new country to start a new life. And I am going through a lot. So I am not present. I am aware that I am not taking care of myself, not being myself on the way I talk, wear, clothes, look. And some people I know judged me or think this is who I really am when. In reality, if I am at my best, I am sure I would not give them a second look. And they are way below my standards. In every aspect they actually judged me upon, like they literally do not know the real me. And it sucks. I hate that I cannot stop caring about. Looking forward to get back to the old me gain my confidence again, just to show them who I actually am. I am not going to see them. But, for example, I can do that on social media. Show them before I unfollow them or block them. I know it sounds dumb, but I really cannot get rid of the feeling, and it is been almost a year

Title: I cannot move on from the girl who has been ghosting me for a half year.
Thread
I had multiple, long distance relationships and ofcourse. They all ended. But that didnt make me upset at all. I could easily move on because those relationships were not meant to be. But this one is different. A year ago, I met this girl who has everything in common with me in so many aspects. We are like twins, and the relationship was perfect for months. The only thing that separated us was me wanting to get serious quickly, and she wanted to take it slowly. After months, she still didnt want to videocall me or make plans about meeting in real life. I put alot of pressure on her to do it anyways. She didnt, and thats where we both got a bit unhappy. We were both not happy anymore. But looking back, I still believe she is the one for me and we are meant to be. This girl is perfect for me, and I do not see a reason why I would not be the right one for her, too, but she has been offline for a half year, only coming online one minute once every months, which means I can almost never talk to her or ask her anything. It is almost as if she doesnt exist. I miss her. Alot, even though she has been ghosting me for a half year already. Thats the evidence I cannot move on. I still love her as much as I always did. I still see her as the perfect one for me. It notJust feelings. I also believe this with my rational thoughts. I want to wait for her to heal from whatever mental issues she is going through and hope she will come back to me. But I also do not want to be alone in false hope. I can choose to wait for her, then maybe she will come back, maybe not, or I can choose to move on and date someone else if I get the opportunity. But since I am unable to get any date in real life, it would just mean another long distance relationship, and I would still miss her even if I got into another relationship because she is so special to me. She is not like anyone I ever dated before. If I date someone else, there is also the risk that later she comes back to me, and I regret dating someone else. I only have options here, and both of them seems terrible. Why is life so fucking unfair? Why did I have to meet the perfect one she loved me for months and then left me for no clear reason. Why does this happen to me and other people stay in their happy relationship forever? Fuck this life? Because it isnt fair

Title: I need to share my ramblings.
Thread
I feel the immense need to write something here, because I cannot contain my words right now. I need someone to hear me and slap me as hard as they can if I say something stupid, because nobody ever tells me the truth. Everyone treats me like I am borderline human, just so that I shut up and leave them in peace. People that want to share their lives with me just do not exist. Holy hell. I am trying so hard not to swear. I will never find someone that will treat me with the respect and love any human being deserves. I see murderers, rapists, psychopaths, the worst humanity has to offer receive love, affection, respect and fear while I get forgotten and tossed to rot on the sidewalk. The moment I leave the field of vision, I have no idea how someone would ever even want to stay seconds in the same room as me, without vomiting blood and running away. I am on the brink. I could just hop onto my car and full frontal my guts onto a wall. I am alone, unlistened to unwanted, unloved, undeserving, useless and pathetic. I will always be. I will die alone and forgotten, not even hated. I would prefer someone to objectively hate me from the bottom of their heart and seek revenge and paint the floor with my brains

When I meet new people, I take my surface of personalities and I blank it. I go off of the person that they give me and I persue it from there. I feel like I disassociate from people and problems in my life. I take things and I shove them down into my memories or brain, and I forget about them. I feel like I could spend a few days without a person and forget about them forever. I could forget about everything that we did together until I really wanted to remember. If I really tried, I could bring memories up. But if not, then I could forget completely

Title: I am so tired.
Thread
I do not even know why I am posting. I am just currently so tired and exhausted. I have work tomorrow, but had the last days off, because I was sick. My weekend just got filled with unexpected plans. When I just wanted to do nothing. The last days, I actually got to sleep until my body felt comfortable waking up. And it is never enough. I am still just as tired I feel at this point. I do not even bother to care. I have been in therapy since the grade. I do not even know what to expect at this point. So fuck me, I guess

Title: Ptsd and periods.
Thread
Cow blood periods. I have hospital related ptsd and I am on my period. It is so overwhelmingly difficult for me to handle my period. I got blood on my bed and I physically cant handle cleaning it up. I just put another sheet on top of it. I have a couple bloody clothes in my room, and I just cant bring myself to cleaning them. I do not know what to do. I want to cry when I go to the restroom and see blood, I just cant stand it. Does anyone have any advice?

Have you considered birth control to stop your periods? I am on the pill and skip mine most months.

I have a chalkboard with a checklist, and one on there is meds, others are brushing teeth, feeding cats, chickens, ducks, clean litter boxes, dishes, exercise any form of outside activity? Eg a walk or gardeningconfusion. Maybe an idea. It helps for me as a depressed person to do daily chores.

Not sure about the meds part, but you could offer to eat with them every now and then and have other reasons for them to eat if they are having a bad day, things like I made too much food. Would you like the leftovers or im grabbing some food at mcdonalds wanna join me for the trip

Title: Coping skills for a party.
Thread
My fianc is having his it day party tomorrow and it will be full of loud drinking people who I either do not know or like. My fianc said he understands I dislike parties, but it means a lot that I am there for at least hours as it will most likely go throughout the night. What tips do you have to help ease anxiety and feel emotionally safe at the party? There is only person who I know and like, but I cannot hang on her side all night nor my francs, as it would not be fair.

Title: Is it selfish to express your negative feelings to someone?
Thread
The thing is, my brother always express his negative feelings and thoughts to my mother, which I can see clearly that is affected her negatively. I see it in two different way. In a way it feels like my bro is sharing the pain with her. He just want to ease the pain for him does not care if he want to split it with loved ones. You would not want to infect anyone. When you have a flu should not be the same with negative thoughts, since it is both contagious in the other way. I see it as nobody can carry the burden of life on his own. Sometimes you need to unload some weight off your chest, taking it all in could lead to collapsing. Im interested to hear ur thoughts

Title: I am worried about messing up, trying to help my friend.
Thread
To it, depression, self harm and suicide it. I have a friend I go to school with and I want to help her. We have our social media accounts to stay connected with each other, including redditconfusion. Recently, I found out about her suicidal thoughts from her reddit posts. She already told me she does self harm, but she never mentioned anything about her suicidal thoughts. I am really concerned about her, but I am also worried that I might mess up and cause an action. I regret. I feel like I do not even know what I am doing most of the time, and I fear that my own actions might cause something bad to happen to my friend. I do not want my friend to suffer anymore, and I am trying to help her as much as I can, but I am no professional and I do not know if I am even saying the right things or doing the right things. Most of the time. I do remember there was a video during school about what to do in this kind of situation, and I still try to follow those steps, but still I have another friend thats also there to help her out, and we are working together to help her. I do not know if I should keep trying to talk to her and comfort her and go off from what I feel is right to say, do, or if I should do something else like, let a professional help herOr something I hope I am not being selfish. I just want to help her some way. Some how sorry for making a whole paragraph bdwconfusion

Title: How do I get help?
Thread
To. So I have been self harming for a while now and am low key suicidal, but I do not know how to ask for help before I started harming myself. I was considering asking if I could get a therapist, but I do not want to burden my parents with having to pay for it, so I kind of just gave up on it. I have also considered multiple times that I should tell my best friend, but I do not want her to hate me or feel like she has to help me or start ignoring me or have some sort of negative reaction to it, as she has mentioned in passing, that she had harmed herself in the past. I do not know what to do. I just do not want to bother anybody, and I do not even have a valid reason for being like this.

Title: I remember everything involuntarily amp I need to stop.
Thread
I remember involuntarily amp I need to stop. Hi. I do not know how to write this without not making sense and being all over the place. I remember things against my will. A lot of its random and irrelevant stuff that once if I am around, it is almost entirely embedded in me. I think I hear someone say their phone number amp it sticks with me for the rest of my fucking life. Most of its numerical. I do not even have to get my debit card out when I am order stuff, because I remember the number digit security code and the expiration date I never tried to any numbers. I do not even know how to explain it more than that birthdays, anything I need to know at work codes, literally anything that has to do with a numerical sequence, it is driving me insane. I was just crying to my mom about it a few minutes ago, I have so much irrelevant shit in my head. I am convinced that is why I get actual, physically throbbing headaches. I am actually terrible in school, I never got straights. As my gpa was average, less than even, and I sucked the most at math. I do not even like numbers. So I have been terrible at school, and it is never helped me recall anything I wanted or needed to and actually has worked against me. I feel like there is this um, entity or thing in my brain, besides me doingThe writing right now that captures this all this information. I do not know why I also think this is the thing that I have to beg to be like everyone is doing this to survive please just conform and do it too. Amp almost like no matter how much I want to do that thing because it will make me a normal member of society if it rejects it, I am fucked. I am not trying to take away any responsibility from my bad grades or anything. I am mainly talking about numbers because of my work, which involves mainly data entry amp bookkeeping outside of that I almost never live in the present because I am within a memory, within a memory, and it just keeps going until I get interrupted by my friend or something, at which point I just look lost. Amp stupid. My best compliment I gave was to my boyfriend on day, saying he made me stay in the present with the stuff we did together. I do not know if this is autism or schizophrenia or nothing. My mom said my dad had it freaked out. People. When I was in las school, people are creeped out. Sometimes, even I have joked, telling them never to say their card or social out loud around me. My boyfriend will call me over when his relatives are over and ask me stuff, and il answer it like some animal doing a cool trick, and they all be shocked. I have toLiterally excuse my self when sensitive information is being shared around me. Everything, especially numbers that I hear in whatevs reorder, be it for a car or birthday or phone number or a licensee state stays with me for fucking ever. I know almost all the dates for everything that is ever happened to me. I would like to remember what matters to me and what is important. I thought this was normal, that everyone has intrusive thoughts, but I remember every fucking thing, and it is almost always useless. And if anything, I am actually convinced that this is the worst my memory has ever been. So I do not even know why this would be happening. I have noticed large black out gaps in my memory. This never happened before. I could recall every single thing that happened to me ever, but that no longer seems to be the case with these black gaps in my head. And yet, this number shit is happening. Amp, even then my memory is bothering me. Has anyone had this happen? This is the first time I am even able to put it into words a little bit. I always knew some shit was up with my head. I always freaking knew it. I just did not know what I mean. I still dont. Its just happening to a point where I cannot ignore it any longer. I remembered everything in elementary school, and I took great advantage of that first to learn all my planets, multiplications, etc.It was the only time anyone considered me smart when I could make use of it. I did, but it seems like it is in maximum overdrive, spongebob reference, lolconfusion. Amp I cannot keep this up. I have a brain cog, working overtime, managing and sharing these useless facts. Amp information to me I mean, the moment I fucking wake up like my god, this is also why I am obsessed with making lists. Amp writing things down so I can actually handle every thought one by one in an order. It is perhaps always why I hate meditating, because I cannot be alone with my mind. Does anyone know anyone like this? Am I overreacting appreciate it? By the way, I will respond to anyone writes, if they know anything or anyone like this. I am so grateful someone read all the way till here.

I do not think I have heard of a problem exactly like this. I suppose the best thing is to talk with a mental health professional. I will pass along a couple of ideas. I do not think it would hurt to try them. The most popular type of meditation, at least here in the us, is mindfulness meditation. I imagine that is what you have tried. People use it to quiet their minds. But this does not work for you. Back in the before, mindfulness became popular, people were using mantra, meditation, saying or thinking some word or phrase over and over again. It can be anything use can use applesauce as your mantra. If you like a psychiatrist named vessel van der folk says that trauma victims say the same thing you say about meditation. They find silence disturbing, at least they do early in their recoveries. He says that trauma victims who are interested in meditation should start with simple relaxation. Then maybe do meditation. Later there, an enormous amount of evidence from laboratory and clinical studies that slow breathing is a fast and effective way to calm down. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a, or min. Slow breathing exercise breaths a min is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale, gently. Seconds each more stress reduction info in my comments,

Title: I have little self worth
Thread
I have let my mental state affect my brother, making him often punish me by turning off my internet power to my room. I also have not had much interactions with people besides my family for over years, so I misunderstand things like sarcasm and get too emotional because of depression. Unfortunately, my brother will not tell me how to fix myself. So I stop doing things wrong, and my mom does not get involved. My point is, my brother has this thing where he wants a response to his questions in less than seconds. But when I get upset, my brain freezes. How can I fix? Brain freeze and still respond in seconds? I think slowly, it often takes me time to come up with a response that is not submissive, but also is not talking back. Is there a way to practice social interactions without leaving my house? Im not seeking things like therapy right now due to covidconfusion
Comments
Wow, the situation you are in sounds really stressful. It sounds kind of never ending. That sounds kind of frightening, actually, if your brother is trying to control and manipulate your life, I would seriously try to suggest that you get away from this situation, if you can. If you tend to freeze up due to stress, this is actually your brain disassociating you from a stressful situation. Normally, when a human gets stressed, they enter the adrenaline, fight or flight state. If they can fight back, then they will fight back. If they can run away, then they will attempt to run away, but if they cannot fight back and they cannot run away, then they will disassociate and freeze. The best thing for you to do would be to try to get away from these stressful situations. If you can, you go live somewhere else with a cousin as well. Something that has helped me, anecdotally with focus is to make sure that you are eating enough food and then try to have a bit of caffeine. You can get caffeine from either coffee or black tea or from energy drinks, or you can even buy caffeine pills on the internet. Caffeine helps with focus, but it does not help with energy, and it requires energy. So you would need to make sure that you are eating enough food to maintain focus through the caffeine. This is not the actual solve the actual solve would be to get away, but it might be aTemporary supplement. Good luck.

Everyday. I feel more and more tired. I am no longer living as myself, but a shell of a person trying to get through school and work. I feel like a burden to my partner, and I get irrationally jealous at every moment he has with his friends, because he lives two hours away and cannot drive. I feel suffocated under all of the expectations I have to uphold. It is a daily struggle to stay sober. I think about hurting myself almost daily, but I cannot ask for help, because it will derail all of my progress ive made. I dream if the day when im finished with all of these expectations so I can fall and relapse and run away from it all

Hey, I was feeling a bit that way. I describe it as just being burnt out. I decided to take a couple months off from everything and quit every form of responsibility to take a staycation at home, caught up with hobbies of mine, catched up with mates, helped out family members, etc. Il be returning to work on monday and will need to reorganise a new uni to start up with. But I think if you are body is telling you it is drained. Listen and slow down happy face or smiley. There is no shame in knowing when it is time to take care of yourself versus trying to keep up with society expectations.

Firstly, I am really sorry. You are feeling that way. That sounds extremely overwhelming and stressful. Secondly, and this is just anecdotal. I am not a doctor. I would honestly recommend making sure you are eating enough food. You should try looking up a calorie calculator online where you can enter in your height and weight and exercise levels, and it will give you an estimate of what you should be having at a minimum in the day to maintain weight. If you are not eating enough calories in the day, then you will feel extremely tired just doing any kind of thinking, especially actually, if you do have to think a lot, then you will just feel completely obliterated. I speak from experience

Title: I am losing my grip on things.
Thread
Everyday. I feel more and more tired. I am no longer living as myself, but a shell of a person trying to get through school and work. I feel like a burden to my partner, and I get irrationally jealous at every moment he has with his friends, because he lives two hours away and cannot drive. I feel suffocated under all of the expectations I have to uphold. It is a daily struggle to stay sober. I think about hurting myself almost daily, but I cannot ask for help, because it will derail all of my progress ive made. I dream if the day when im finished with all of these expectations so I can fall and relapse and run away from it all

Title: Anxiety, dreams.
Thread
I feel like every night I have dreams that cause me anxiety it is literally just a montage of things happening that cause me stress and me having to find solutions to these problems its been ongoing for over years now I have been in various medications throughout I also have dream flashbacks that give me almost panic attacks that my psychiatrist could not explain any experience or ideas to help stop these I have tried meditation hypnosis been on various medications have done counselling before and currently awaiting another form of counselling its just been so exhausting like I wake up and I have had the complete opposite of rest it is draining

This is purely anecdotal. I am not a doctor. Something that I have noticed that affects myself is citrus fruits I have noticed, especially if I eat something like apples or pineapples or strawberries, but really any kind of fruit that I will get anxiety dreams it sounds like is, but I asked my dad, who is very similar to me genetically, and he said, it also happens to him I have noticed I can have vegetables like lettuce or cabbage or onions, though. So I still do have salads and things just no fruit. Also, what seemed to help was trying to analyze what the anxiety dreams were metaphorically about. I kept having dreams about, generally, the places I was living. Being very stressful, getting away from those stressful places helps. But then also, once you get away and have been away for a while and are safely able to get away again, if you need to, I would honestly suggest, if you are still getting anxiety, dreams about such a place or thing that exposure therapy may help where you go back to those locations and understand that you are stronger than them physically in person, that just what helped me anecdotally, though,

Title: I have lost all my friends. My mental health has been spiraling down and I am planning on taking my life.
Thread
Last summer, I was accepted into the university of linking in sweden. I promptly moved there from retro for studying because of my autism. I never managed to make friends with the people in my group or the people in my corridor. I decided to stick to my friends from college, whom I shared lots of interests and personality traits with. Last november, I made the dumbest decision of my life, possibly the dumbest decision a human being could do. My best friends girl broke up with him, so I decided to talk to both of them and just kind of try to help them out, especially the girl since she was scared of losing all her friends, because she felt like her ex was the only connection she had with the rest of her friends. She and I had already known each other for about a year and a half. And in one of our calls on discord, she confessed that she had liked me ever since the first day we met my dumbass blurted out something about wanting to be together with her. After which she replied, do you really want to? I said, yeah, we tried to keep it discrete, but after about two weeks, I confessed to my best friend saying that I have been together with her for a few weeks. He actually said he was fine with it, so we stayed with each other for longer. In reality, he obviously was not fine with it and despised me. I quicklyRealized that people have stopped replying to my messages and asked, what was going on? Everybody said, essentially the same thing. Youre a fucking dumbass. I completely agree with themi am a fucking dumbass. I deserve every single consequence that followed. Now, I am sitting here in my shitty university dorm, isolated. I cannot get myself to cook, study or do anything really nobody to speak to except my parents who also hate me for what I have done. There is, however, one friend who is neutral on the matter, he still wants to hang out and wish me the best. But me being the asshole that I am pushed him away because of my depression, I have thrown up twice out of malnutrition and sheer anxiety. Since then, sorry for the long post, I do not exactly have anywhere else to get everything off my chest.

Title: Did I just have a psychotic episode?
Thread
Okay, so for context, I have always strongly suspected I have either bipolar disorder or bad, never seen a professional, so do which one, and cannot officially say I have anyconfusion. So im used to switching between depression and mania, but my episodes have been getting more intense lately. Nil I know it is not ideal. But since uni, I have picked up the habit of using weed to regulate my mood swings be they have been worse than usual and harder to deal with. But I did not like how dependent I was becoming on weedconfusion. So I decided to go back home for a bit to force myself to take a break from it. Anyway, tonight, I decided to go to sleep after watching some to like normal. But when I got into bed, literally, my whole body was shaking, got myself to calm down. But as soon as I closed my eyes, it is like I lost all sense of reality, and I could not feel my body. It is like I was just a consciousness trapped in a void, and I could not come back to reality, no matter how hard I tried, actually, the harder I tried, the louder that screeching voice was teasing me and telling me, il never get back. Thank fucking god, I managed to get back. But it was only to find myself hitting my own head. My body was shaking, but out of fear this time, and I felt like my mind was going crazy, likeA bad trip or something. Nothing looked real literally made me cry and me never crying is like a personality trait at this pointconfusion. I then went on tiktok to try to distract myself. My everyone looked possessed. I nearly threw my phone, wouldve went to get my mom or sister but there is this huge mirror right in front of my bed and I was convinced id see some creepy stuff in it or get swallowed by it if I get too close. Also, my mind was racing and a lot of intrusive thoughts about ripping off my skin to check if im real were haunting me. This all only realistically lasted less than min, but I did gloss over lots of details now that im typing. It sounds very dramatic, but like the whole time I was conscious, it was an episode of smith and that all my thought were irrational and tbe it was not like insanely intense. The closest thing I know and could find on the internet is psychosis. But I feel like my experience was too mild and short for it to be that. And calling it psychosis feels way too dramatic for just me loosing my shit in my bed for a few minutes anyway, does anyone know if there is a name for this? It is the first time it happens to me. So im a bit confused and concerned

Yes, this is normal. And we live in an abnormal society. One problem many people face is they are afraid to reach out and are waiting for someone just as afraid to reach out to them. Since we live in a punitive adversarial society, people just do not reach out and instead close themselves off.

We all get that feeling, and it really does, sucks, and it is an unbearable pain. I learned that before you can love somebody, you have to learn to love yourself. You are not prepared to love if you painfully desire it hell, it could probably even be just the loneliness talking, which can even hurt yourself and others. Your romantic love will come in time, friend. But for now, you can start loving yourself. There is no better love than making yourself become the best version that you can be.

This is not going to sound overly helpful, but I can tell you that the more you crave it, the less likely you are to get it. I am so familiar with this feeling in the form of friendship, not relationshipsconfusion. The person, on the other end can feel the desperation and can feel your urgency and need of it, and it will push them away from you, because they will not be able to match your level of commitment in such a short period when you find someone you be clinging onto them for dear life, because you cannot bear the thought of being alone again, and it just overwhelm them. The best thing you can do right now sounds so counter intuitiveconfusion is to forget about loving someone else and fall in love with yourself with every part of you, fall in love with everything you do and all of your biggest strengths. Once you have done that, you radiate a completely different energy, and that is the energy that your future partner will be drawn towards. Finding love or new friendships is only hard work. If the version of yourself that you are presenting to the world is not loveable, likeable, receiving healing in this scenario cannot come from an external source. Person it has to come from within good luck. It is not an overnight process, but with lots of little steps and ongoing commitment you get there, I promise

Title: Fuck sex I just want to be loved.

I am so fucking lonely I have never been in a meaningful relationship, and I am. And it is my deepest desire. Everywhere I go in public, I see couples who seem happy, and that is all I want to have someone to love and cherish someone I can come home to and talk to about my day, someone to make me feel safe, someone I can be the best husband to. The loneliness is fucking unbearable. I know I am still very young, but every time I come close to having a relationship, I fuck it up because of my mental health. I have borderline personality disorderconfusion. I feel so empty and like a big part of my life is missing. I see beautiful girls everywhere that I should be talking to and getting to know. But there is always something in the way fuck, ladies, if you want to seriously vibe with and get to know a good man, please message me I do not really have a lot of friends. I just want someone to fucking talk to and vibe with right now.

I am not sure if I am the only one, but I will literally just whisper to myself about the stupidest or weirdest things ever. I am too embarrassed to even say it, but sometimes it will be like I am a therapist talking to someone me flirting with someone me pretending to be a celebrity me pretending to talk to a crowd and act like I have had a traumatic past me talking about my crush like it is an audio recording and I have already died or me talking to myself like it is a suicide note and people are listening. Im not suicidalconfusion. And then sometimes in those conversations with myself, I can even start crying. I cannot tell if it is purposely or if I am actually crying. And then I feel like a crazy person. I know it sounds so weirdly specific, but I think maybe I am just bored. I hope I do not have anything wrong with me. Do any of you guys do this

Yeah, if you feel unhappy and feel like you need some help, then absolutely social skills do not come natural to everyone. It is ok. You could pick up some books on the topic and just practice talking to people and picking up on social cues. What do you feel insecure about? Maybe you need to pick up some healthy hobbies, like working out or something? My advice find something you enjoy and like to do and use that to make better social connections when I was your age, it was boxing for me.

Title: The only thing that stopped me from killing myself tonight is that I did not have enough pills to overdose.
Thread
I have not been doing well for a while mentally, and I finally broke down after my wife and I got into an argument. So while she was busy, I went to the medicine cabinet, grabbed a bottle of pain killers and went to the bedroom. I knew she was not going to come in because she is still upset with me. I went to the bedroom and just sat there crying, thinking about how I deserve to die and that im worthless and not man enough to be here. So I go to open the bottle, and there is only left in the bottle. So now I am sitting here still feeling like I deserve to die and even more of a failure, because I cannot even kill myself properly. I have calmed down a bit now, but honestly, the only thing that stopped me from killing myself is that I forgot to refill my prescription and did not have enough to kill myself tonight.
Comments
I am so glad you are still here. Im glad everything happens for a reason and you did not have your refill. A fight is for the moment that decision would have been forever if your wife arguments are making you so sad, you want to die, maybe consider some counseling together if it did not have so much to do with that fight, but more to do with general mental health. Maybe talk to her about how bad you feel when I talk to my husband about my mental health, its just nice to know at least one person knows how terrible I feel if you do not have a therapist definitely get one. They are someone who is empathic and can really listen to all your problems and help you consider better solutions. And you can work on better coping skills in those moments. Even if you and your wife were to divorce, im sure she would not want to hear you committed suicide. Dont kill yourself. So many people would be heart broken

Title: Add adhd ocd
Thread
Hi. My name is andrew. I am a year old guy. I have been almost sure lately that it is very likely that I have either some type of attention deficit disorder, maybe even possibly a compulsion disorder. Let me explain when I am normally supposed to be paying attention. In this case, on line, I tend to get very distracted and start losing focus. At the beginning of the course, I tend to be alright at paying attention and understanding the topics. Over time, I somehow lost the focus and I lose grasp of the concepts I am supposed to be learning. And in addition, I start giving into some habits that take away from my learning and studying when I am supposed to have my eyes on the screen to understand the different topics I am learning about. I instead grab a notebook and start studying and attempting to learn a language, and more specifically, their language script. I started with arabic and the arabic abugida, also hindi, and the devanagari script. I had recently began to look into the tamil script to ideally get into the language later.

Its almost certainly not compulsiveness as symptomatic of ocd, but it would not hurt to talk to a professional about the other stuff.

Title: Add adhd ocd
Thread
Hi. My name is andrew. I am a year old guy. I have been almost sure lately that it is very likely that I have either some type of attention deficit disorder, maybe even possibly a compulsion disorder. Let me explain when I am normally supposed to be paying attention. In this case, on line, I tend to get very distracted and start losing focus. At the beginning of the course, I tend to be alright at paying attention and understanding the topics. Over time, I somehow lost the focus and I lose grasp of the concepts I am supposed to be learning. And in addition, I start giving into some habits that take away from my learning and studying when I am supposed to have my eyes on the screen to understand the different topics I am learning about. I instead grab a notebook and start studying and attempting to learn a language, and more specifically, their language script. I started with arabic and the arabic abugida, also hindi, and the devanagari script. I had recently began to look into the tamil script to ideally get into the language later. And just today, I have decided to write down the hebrew script. Can this be indicative of an add, possibly adhd, or possibly ocd? Amp also, I just generally have a hard time paying attention.

My voice gets made fun a lot by people I love and by strangers I get how you feel its fucking rude. And I dont think people think about how that will affect the person they are poking fun at, whether they think theyare being light hearted or not.

Title: How to encourage my wife to get support.
Thread
I have just created this account because I am feeling a bit desperate and would like some advice. The short of it is that my wife, mental health, appears to be very poor, and she has become very unwell. She is completely unwilling to get help. I really do not know what is wrong with her, and I am not trying to get a diagnosis via reddit or anything. I just want her to get some help, and I want to support her properly, but she outright refuses. Our situation is that we have been married for years. I think something changed a few years ago where she would become highly emotional, either upset or angryconfusion at very small things. When she calmed down, she would always acknowledge that the behaviour was uncharacteristic, and we thought it may have been hormonal. She went and got tested, but nothing was abnormal. I just said that if anything like that happened to just chill and rest and I would take care of the kids household stuff, so she did not have to feel any stress at those difficult times. I work it, she works it. And before this, we would split up cooking, cleaning, pretty much since she would do all the school runsconfusion. The problem was it just got more and more frequent and more and more intense. It sounds like I am making this up. But this really happened, like fairly recently I heard her screaming and screaming. As though she was being attacked. I ranInside to see what happened, and our elderly cat had missed the litter tray, and some of the urine was on the tiles. I told her I would clean it up, but she was inconsolable. I hate to say it, but she just seemed unhinged and sobbed after she calmed down. She was really upset, that she behaved that way and said that she does not feel normal. And I suggested that we she try and find a counsellor. She agreed. But that was the only time she did when I tried to follow it up by offering to look some up. She got really defensive. Those sorts of episodes are actually happening pretty frequently. Now I have taken over all the cooking and cleaning household stuff and have organised a school run so she can just be at home and relax, but it could be anything totally small that sets her off screaming and sobbing. The most recent that occurred today was her finding a cockroach in the kitchen. I have tried to approach her in the good times gently and tell her that I love her, am worried about her, and I want her to be happy again and will help find someone to talk to, but I have given up because no matter how I express it or when it sets her off into screams sobs. I know to anyone reading, you must think that she sounds nuts, but she is just not the person I married, and I know that something mustBe going on psychologically that I cannot help her with on my own. This is not how she usually is. She is unwell, and I want her to get professional help. I just do not know what to do. Frown, sad, angry or pouting.

I dont think she sounds nuts. You are being a great spouse. It sounds like you have done a lot of research on how to approach her properly and how to care for her while she is unwell. That is great. And you are so great. It is not easy to love someone who is mentally unwell. I would say she sounds like she is suffering from anxiety or maybe depression. Im not a doctor, but someone who had a lot of panic attacks. There is no consoling someone in the midst of a panic attack. Usually, they come on when you have been holding in a ton of stress until the smallest thing causes you to bubble over, and it bubbles over in mass amounts until its all let out again. Im so sorry, she is not getting help. Its like a drug addict. You cannot drag them there until they are ready. They can just leave or quit at any time. I tried to drag my husband to marriage counseling he never showed, etc. What I would do is what you are doing talking to her when she is calm, bringing her options of counseling near you guys, maybe even online options. Sometimes, getting out of the house is too much in the midst of depression. That idea I have to drive for an hour, long session is stressful. I hope she decides to get the help she really needs. She will feel better. Getting to at least talk to someone that is empatheticAnd can really understand.

I know I have already posted on here, but I do not really know who to vent to without feeling bad about bothering them about my venting. But I hate the weekends I spend most of them just laying in bed doing nothing, because nothing seems interesting anymore. It all bland and just feels like it is not worth it in my eyes. Drawing has even become boring, and that is one of the things I enjoy. I genuinely miss the times where I would be able to go to my local park and just sit there. I used to rush home from school just to go to the park and sit

My doctors have assured me that it looks like more than it is since most of them are co morbid and technically all in the same class depression and anxietyconfusion, but it still makes me feel so fucking ashamed. I got another doctor to test me as well, just in case, because the list of mental illnesses seemed too much, and they came back with the exact same list.

I completely understand how you feel. I currently have diagnosetongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry depression since I was a young teen anxiety since I was a teenconfusion ocd again since I was a teenconfusion ptsd since I was confusion. Substance use disorder. And we are working on diagnosing what im going through now most likely bad. It feels weird to have so much going on, and its like a lot of people do not understand it. My husband is completely healthy. He does not know how to deal with anxiety attacks, panic attacks. He feels like you should just be able to calm down. I am on an antidepressant now, was supposed to try more drugs, but I told my doctor I did not like the side effects. I am waiting to get second opinions before trying anything else. Since what I am on now has not helped me at all. I go to therapy once a week. Its nice to talk about things with her. I just try to stay as positive as possible. What keeps me here when im suicidal is the fact that I am a practicing counselor, case manager. My experiences can help other people. I tell myself, I need to be here so other people can survive that I suffer, so they wont

One of the things that may be happening is that you are being dual diagnosed for the same thing. What stands out as truly unique disorders are adhd, ptsd, social anxiety, ocd and body dysmorphic, and possibly trichotillamaniaconfusion. For example, ptsd depression and anxiety can look alike. On the depressive side of things, feel badly about self disengage from the world, etcconfusion. And on the anxious agoraphobic side of things, avoiding situations that may be triggering, being nervous around others, or certain situations only feel comfortable at homeconfusion. So in many clinical cases, ptsd alone may be enough to account for each of these factors. One way to think about diagnoses is if one disorder were resolved, say ptsdconfusion would any other disorders no longer be relevant for many people who successfully complete trauma treatment. Clinical depression, agoraphobic tendencies and even general anxiety may no longer become clinically significant. If that is the case, then it is likely this person was over diagnosed in the first place as the ptsd was the chore anchor

The determining factor of whether there is trauma or not is not what happens to you it what your brain does with the experience it entirely possible to be traumatized by nightmares hallucinations, things that do not affect other people. You have not found the right therapist. Someone who is trained in emir would not treat you that way too many therapists do not get enough training in trauma. I hope you are able to find the right one to help you.

I am turning this year and have never been on date. No girl has ever shown any sign of being slightly interested in me. I have no friends. There is people I talked to, but they never ever text me. And when I do it is usually a dry generic convo. I installed tinder to try and talk to people, only to realize I rarely get matches because I am ugly, but that I also have no social skills and will not even start a conversation, because I am afraid to. I am extremely fucking skinny. I am around it. Confusion and I weight like keg. I have tried so hard to gain weight, but it is just impossible. I ve taken meds, I eat a lot. Nothing ever works. However, the moment I do not eat something, I instantly lose weight, and I cannot but wonder why this happens to me. I am not good at anything. I play games for most of my day and I am not particularly good at anything. I played this one game for over hours, and I am probably barely above average. I am not good at drawing. I am not good at sports. I joined the football team a few years ago and was decent, but barely ever played because of being too skinny. One time when I did come on, I heard someone from the other time make fun of me. I took this course for my years of high school and I hated it, mostly becauseI suck at it and cannot learn anything for some reason. The only subject I was good at was english. I from portugal, so it is my and languageconfusion, and honestly, it is a mystery why it, like I have always known english despite it not being my first language. I used to watch this show called top gear with my brother and read the subtitles in portuguese, but I kind of already understood what they were saying.

Hey, dude, I just wanted to say that maybe you just have not found the things that you are truly good at. Yet. I went through most of high school thinking that I was not that good at any one thing. Many of my friends were talented singers, actors, dancers, painters, etc. I felt so frustrated because I did not feel like I was that good at anything. But then during my time in college, I found my calling, and it gave me the motivation to continue my advice would be to try to focus less on what you are not great at, and more on what you are good at or on finding what you are good at. I know that it is incredibly difficult to shift your mindset like that, but I think it is worth a try. Hang in there. Feel free to message me if you want to talk about this more happy face or smiley

I think men in general do not get many matches on tinder so I wouldnt worry about that it is a shit app anyway I think that if you havent already and if you want toconfusion you should start counting your calories and make sure you eat enough there are plenty of apps for doing that. I am very skinny as well. But a few years ago, I managed to gain kegs in months using one of these apps. I wish you only the best try not to be so harsh on yourself pleading, face

Hey, dude, I do not have much advice, but I just wanted to say, I read this and that sucks for what it is worth. I think a lot of people are not that good at anything as young adults I know it feels shitty, but it is okay if you do not have life figured out right now.

Title: I hate life.

I am turning this year and have never been on date. No girl has ever shown any sign of being slightly interested in me. I have no friends. There is people I talked to, but they never ever text me. And when I do it is usually a dry generic convo. I installed tinder to try and talk to people, only to realize I rarely get matches because I am ugly, but that I also have no social skills and will not even start a conversation, because I am afraid to. I am extremely fucking skinny. I am around it. Confusion and I weight like keg. I have tried so hard to gain weight, but it is just impossible. I ve taken meds, I eat a lot. Nothing ever works. However, the moment I do not eat something, I instantly lose weight, and I cannot but wonder why this happens to me. I am not good at anything. I play games for most of my day and I am not particularly good at anything. I played this one game for over hours, and I am probably barely above average. I am not good at drawing. I am not good at sports. I joined the football team a few years ago and was decent, but barely ever played because of being too skinny.

I do not think you understand narcissistic personality disorder or this post of yours would not exist as a former victim of a covert narcissist. You bet your I warn people to run away from narcissists. They do not care about anyone, but themselves. They use and manipulate. They enjoy doing it, and they throw people away like trash. When they do not get their way, you should read some of those articles. It not all that unusual to be misdiagnosed. There is a difference between a traumatized, anxious, socially awkward kid trying to figure out how to be a mature adult and being clingy or needy, and someone with narcissistic personality disorder. If you have nod, everyone should steer well clear because they have a right not to be used for the gratification of another person. And that is exactly what such a disorder entails seriously doubt that anyone with nod would even bother trying to change. They just do not see the need for therapy at all. They will manipulate the therapist my long ago, ex manipulated, the couples therapist we tried to work with in the wink of an eye. Everything was about me how depressed I was, and I could not say a word because I knew I would pay for it later because he was abusive, because he did not care. People with personality disorders do not just change. In a few months of therapy. Many of them have zero motivation to, because it is part of the disorder that theySee absolutely no need to it. Everyone else, problem not theirs. Read the articles. If you truly understood what nod really is, you would not be questioning why an announcement of having it results in distance. No one wants to be abused, that why you re essentially warning people away from you?

Narcissist does not always mean people with nod. Narcissism is inherently bad, and I think you know that. Op because you are trying actively to do something about it. Maybe it is your disordered thinking that everything is about you. But in this case, it is really not. I am saying that nod is probably more rare than people who are narcissists. So more often than not, those kinds of posts are about them. I recommend watching videos of edit sorry hit sent too soonconfusion. I am hoping for the best for your treatment.

I partially agree with the other commenter in some way, it does not sound like you have nod limo, particularly that you feel remorse and do not blame others for your actions. I know a couple other diagnoses that also potentially include narcissistic traits that may be more fitting instead of nod. Obviously, I am not a professional, but therapists do make mistakes in diagnoses. So if you have not had a second opinion from another professional, specially trained in personality disorders, I would take that first diagnosis with a grain of salt

I get that metal health so stigmatized there is still so much misinformation going around. Narcissism is definitely viewed in a much different light then something like depression, and yet it can be so challenging in its own ways. I struggle with adhd myself and have to deal with different but also frustrating stigmas, like people questioning if the nuralogical disorder even exists or constantly being demeaned for the medication I am prescribed just so I can try to function in society. Hopefully in the future, more education will go out on mental health to eliminate some of these stigmas or stereo types that people sue to define

I have empathy for people with narcissism, but at the same time, I believe it is important to protect one self. There also, I am sure a difference between a person with narcissism and narcissistic abuse. It pretty rare for someone with narcissism to want to work on themselves. I really admire that in anyone, but especially in someone with narcissism.

Title: You are fine.
Thread
Ever since I was young, I have been told things like you are doing so well you re fine there, nothing worrisome about you by teachers, doctors and recently, a psychiatrist. I was abused in childhood, and I was super independent and self reliant because there was no other choice in teachers and adults. Pov, I was doing fine even great. Yet, inside my head, I hated myself so much. I wished I did not exist and I was in so much pain. And yet all I got was compliments and adults telling other kids to be like me. I am now and recently took the courage to go to a psychiatric for the first time to discuss the troublesome feelings I have had. I have had a hard time with school, and for many months, I was unable to do anything. I opened my heart to her and told everything honestly. After the first appointment, the therapist told me, you seem to be doing fine and you have caused me no worries. I was baffled. How can you know that? After one minute session throughout our sessions, she refused to see what was going on. Even after I was crying, talking about what had happened to me. It felt like she was talking to someone next to me, not me. I read the medical records, and she wrote there, they seemed only want to have a conversation with a validating adult. There is no need to continue the therapy. Ah, yes, me not wanting toExist is normal and completely fine. I am fine. My feelings have never been validated for a moment. I even started to believe the therapist saying that I am fine and that it is all in my head. But then the memories and feelings come back like a truck and tell me I am not fine because I am not. But it seems I am the only one who will ever know that I want to talk about my feelings. But I do not know. Do I have the courage anymore to try a different therapist? I feel like I am just bothering them with my nonsense since I am fine.

Definitely consider a different therapist as therapists can approach treatment in very different ways and why you want to be in therapy is it to open and process through difficult things from the past to find solutions to a current difficulty one thing to think about some therapists are very action change focused which would not require a patient to share that much about their history but instead to identify a specific problem today I anxious about crowdsconfusion and then work on fixing that problem which generally would not require much discussion of why this problem arose in the first place.

A few days later my pet died now I have problems with university. I feel so shit I know that pal can be sad and whatever.

This video is part of a suicide prevention series. A lot of people are complaining that it is hard to get therapy since the lockdown and you may want to look at online therapy and self help. What I usually tell people treatment usually begins by seeing the go, who can give you a referral? I mention referral, because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day. Any symptoms you might have, such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life affecting how you feel if you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lihelp with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle, things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also, traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this one practical advice for motivation. Very important

Title: Help me get away from my abusive family.
Thread
Hello, sweet members. I am talia raza from india. I need help to get away from my abusive family, a little backgrountongue, sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. I am years old male living with my mother, my mother lately, or I guess has always been. I am just realising it nowconfusion getting abusive towards me. It been years since she started asking me to kill myself. She never feels sorry for things she do and or say when I was, she threw a knife at my face, but fortunately, the hilt of the knife hit my face. There are countless incidei like this, but this one always breaks my heart whenever I think about it. She never showed any remorse for it. I wake up everyday and everyday. She tells me things like, I am a mistake and I should die or she should have killed me when I was a baby. These words were thrown around frequently. Even when I was a small child. I never knew it would start affecting me this much. Now. My mother and father have been separated since, as long as I can remember, I have not seen or been in contact with my father for more than a decade. He sends my mother money. And that is, all I know. The financial situation is not that great. Though. I graduated from my highschool in the year right before couid outbreak, I had to quit my further studies and work some small meagre jobs to earn someMoney to provide. Now, when the things are going back to normalcy, I wish to pursue my education, join a college and get a degree, but my mother does not want me to. She wants me to quit my studies altogether and work. I do not want to do that, and my refusal is making her more and more abusive. I have no one in the world whom I love as much as her. I really want her to stop doing this. I cannot say I miss her old self, but I do want all this to end once I wish to move out.

Stop apologizing you need to get out of there. You need to be confident and live your life on your terms. You need to heal. No one should go through years of that abuse. You deserve to peruse your dreams and passions. You need to find some roommates or something. Its not healthy.

Title: Help me get away from my abusive family.
Thread
Hello, sweet members. I am talia raza from india. I need help to get away from my abusive family, a little backgrountongue, sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. I am years old male living with my mother, my mother lately, or I guess has always been. I am just realising it nowconfusion getting abusive towards me. It been years since she started asking me to kill myself. She never feels sorry for things she do and or say when I was, she threw a knife at my face, but fortunately, the hilt of the knife hit my face. There are countless incidei like this, but this one always breaks my heart whenever I think about it. She never showed any remorse for it. I wake up everyday and everyday. She tells me things like, I am a mistake and I should die or she should have killed me when I was a baby. These words were thrown around frequently. Even when I was a small child. I never knew it would start affecting me this much. Now. My mother and father have been separated since, as long as I can remember, I have not seen or been in contact with my father for more than a decade. He sends my mother money. And that is, all I know. The financial situation is not that great. Though. I graduated from my highschool in the year right before couid outbreak, I had to quit my further studies and work some small meagre jobs to earn someMoney to provide. Now, when the things are going back to normalcy, I wish to pursue my education, join a college and get a degree, but my mother does not want me to. She wants me to quit my studies altogether and work. I do not want to do that, and my refusal is making her more and more abusive. I have no one in the world whom I love as much as her. I really want her to stop doing this. I cannot say I miss her old self, but I do want all this to end once I wish to move out. I do not know if that is a good decision, but I believe that if I move out, I might just get out of this abusive environment and work on myself. Currently, I teach few kids near my house, and it pays me inr, roughly usdconfusion, and that is not enough to move out. I have lost two years of my life, and I want to start my college. All the money I earn. I give that to my mother. I have literally zero rupees in my account. I do not know how and when I am going to do this, but I have made my mind. I cannot waste one more year.

Title: I cannot live with myself, and I do not know if I should.

I do not know if this is the right place for this but it is seriously impacting my mental health and I want to hear from other people I am a white year old boy who grew up with left leaning parents all my life I have hated racist people I have always thought that racism is a characteristic of people who do not deserve to be alive I guess it was a combination of attention seeking internet jokes that we saw and us not truly believing what we were saying but when I was around and my friends and I started making satirical racism jokes so like we would say something racist but in a tone that was clearly not serious at all it was not our place to do that but I guess we felt it was fine since we did not actually stand by the words that were coming out of our mouths this quickly devolved into us saying awful things I would blurt out the word on sleepovers to make my friends laugh for example I used it in text convoy too because we thought it was hilarious due to the shock value my mentality at the time was that its okay to say if I do not actually mean it or use it against someone but I was severely uneducated there are worse examples like a joke I made in an instagram group chat that is so absurdly racist I cannot even bring myself to talk about it I was reallyThat bad and probably worse than I am making it seem I was an awful attention seeking little piece of worthless shit for around years. All of this has been in the back of my mind no matter what I do since then, I have become much more educated, and I am very happy with the person I am today. But I cannot focus on that with the past I have. I lack motivation and am seriously depressed. I want to be able to focus on the moment and being better in the future. But I have no idea if I should. When I think about who I am right now, I think about the good things I have done to stand against racism. I have not made any serious impact. But when I see kids at my school post something racist or do something racist, I usually do something about it and stand up against them. I have been in the principals office a lot because of it, and half the school hates me. Even just nights ago, I saw a cop car, and as usual, I flipped them off. But this time they saw me chased me down and made me get on the ground while I argued with them about how they are driven by systemic racism, I was really proud of that. Even if it was dumb of me. When I have money, I want to donate to charities that help dismantle racist institutions. And I seriously want to do my partIn ending racism against african americans. Although I do not believe that my or year old self would disagree with me, I do not believe that I would be doing what I am if I was still in my old mindset. I think the guilt I have definitely has it is upsides, but I cannot help think that I am forever tarnished by my past. I just want to hear if anyone has any advice, I am not suicidal. But I have, for sure, thought about ending my life because of the guilt I feel. I know that I can bring something good to this world, but I am being held back by the fucking idiot I used to be. Can I forgive myself at all, or am I not in the position to do that?

Do you have any idea how many of us look back on our puberty and cringe? This is nothing special, I assure you.

Nobody wins an argument. Dale carnegie in how to win friends and influence people first, look for ways to avoid arguments. If you go to the amazon ad for the ptsd sourcebook by do glenn schiraldi, you will see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there is a variety of symptoms associated with ptsd, some of which respond to self help. It has an anger management chapter. We all get angry sometimes so long as anger is not connected to a plan to do someone harm and we do not hold on to it. Anger is just an unpleasant feeling that comes and goes like a thunderstorm there an easy way to calm down, slow breathing. This is what borderline personality disorder patients are told to do sit or lie down with a hand on your abdomen so you can feel it swell as you inhale, then breathe slowly and gently, while counting seconds sec to inhale. Sec, to exhale. The evidence for therapeutic breathing is amazing. It used to treat panic disorder and ptsd, whatever changes your mood, a funny movie or smoothing music is good

Title: How to function in society with avoidant personality disorder.
Thread
Hello. Previously, I have been diagnosed with avoidant personality disorder and recurrent depressive disorder. I am currently being evaluated again as I am suicidal. I am sure some added diagnoses will come. I am and have almost always been insecure in myself and in social situations and in relationships to others. I would say I have severe social anxiety. I am very easily offended, very paranoid. I always think someone is out to get me or that anything is about me. In a negative way. I have never functioned well alone. I still live with my mom at most of the time. She has made the food and done household chores. I can do some, but I am easily overwhelmed when there is too much to do. I avoid it if I do not know how to do it, I avoid it. Anything I do not know how works gives me severe anxiety and nervousness. This includes economy and money. I cannot have a subscription to anything, for example, netflix, because it gives me crippling anxiety and fear of losing all my money. In my current job, I have been paranoid every single day for a year. I feel everyone judges me, wants me gone. Boss wants to fire me. Any comment I feel is an attack on me. Nervous if boss brings something up extremely paranoid. Before evaluation talk, prepared every day for a week, talking to myself, making arguments, etc. I make conflicts with my coworkers. I could give a lot of examples ofAll these things and more, I just do not feel like I can function in society, and that something is definitely wrong with me is anyone else like this? How do you function?

Title: How can I help my friend when she is super paranoid right now?
Thread
I confusion have a friend we call her confusion, who im pretty sure is she is having a psychotic break or a mental breakdown or something about a month ago, she dropped out of college them begged her boss to give her extra hours at work. Once her got those extra hours, she started calling out every other day, sleeping until noon, waking up just to eat and go back to sleep. Now this could just be depression that is what I thought until about weeks ago when she suddenly did a emotionally and now she is just full of energy and rage. She is been lashing out at everyone all day. And then all night she wants to go party and hang out. If people turn her down, she gets extremely angry. The major thing is sunday night, she blocked everyone one, all forms of social media, then send a text to all of our friends, making a suicide threat we later learned from her of she was perfectly fine and safe and sitting right next to him playing gamesconfusion and saying that everyone has been lying to her and talking about her behind her back and ignoring her, she been saying that we have seen her in public and ignored her on purpose and that we are making her crazy her of says that when he tries to talk to her about her health, she gets enraged and says he does not trust her and is on their side, meaning my friend, groupconfusion. IDo not know what to do on one side. I do not want to talk to her until we get an apology for the fake suicide threat as I recently lost a very close friend to suicide. She is knows this has been extremely hard for me and yet she made the fake threat anyway. But on the other hand, I am super worried about her and do not know what I can actually do to help her. She does not trust anyone right now and is very paranoid.

I went though something like this with a classmate, just keep checking in on them. You dont have to talk them, but just make sure they are alright. Hopefully she will apologize when she is ready. If that doesnt work. Im sorry, im out of ideas.

I am turning this year and have never been on date. No girl has ever shown any sign of being slightly interested in me. I have no friends. There is people I talked to, but they never ever text me. And when I do it is usually a dry generic convo. I installed tinder to try and talk to people, only to realize I rarely get matches because I am ugly, but that I also have no social skills and will not even start a conversation, because I am afraid to. I am extremely fucking skinny. I am around it. Confusion and I weight like keg. I have tried so hard to gain weight, but it is just impossible. I ve taken meds, I eat a lot. Nothing ever works. However, the moment I do not eat something, I instantly lose weight, and I cannot but wonder why this happens to me. I am not good at anything. I play games for most of my day and I am not particularly good at anything. I played this one game for over hours, and I am probably barely above average. I am not good at drawing. I am not good at sports. I joined the football team a few years ago and was decent, but barely ever played because of being too skinny. One time when I did come on, I heard someone from the other time make fun of me. I took this course for my years of high school and I hated it, mostly becauseI suck at it and cannot learn anything for some reason. The only subject I was good at was english. I from portugal, so it is my and languageconfusion, and honestly, it is a mystery why it, like I have always known english despite it not being my first language. I used to watch this show called top gear with my brother and read the subtitles in portuguese, but I kind of already understood what they were saying. I started having english classes in the grade and already understood it.

I hear a lot of negative self talk here coming from a person who struggles with depression you sound like me in my head on some of my worst days its really hard to see yourself in a positive light when your brain is really used to saying really awful things about yourself. I know you do not want to see yourself this way just by virtue that you said one positive aspect about yourself towards the end there but then just brushed it off as something that is not good enough. Learning other languages is very hard confusion. I might venture to say that you still have hope and you absolutely should. You are very young and still have so much time. I do not know you, but I suggest you search out some resources for your mental health, maybe cut, which trains you to rewire your thinking in a way that has positive impacts on the way you think and act. Don stop trying until you get what you need to start feeling better, because you deserve that maybe once you start feeling better, you will feel more willing to talk to women and have a more positive outlook on that venture. I was rejected a lot in high school, and I never really got into the dating scene until I could get outside of old mental frameworks that I trapped myself in. I believe in you

A lot of people are complaining that it is hard to get therapy since the lockdown and you may want to look at online therapy and self help. What I usually tell people treatment usually begins by seeing the go, who can give you a referral? I mention referral, because just a bottle of pills is not a very good approach. The things you would want to tell the doctor are how you feel at different times of day. Any symptoms you might have, such as change in appetite or sleep and things in your life affecting how you feel if you are depressed, I cannot tell you exactly what you need there. No one size fits all solution. I can tell you, though, that there are healthy lifestyle choices that can enhance the effects of the standard treatments with office visits. Video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lihelp with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also, traditional asian methods. If the link above does not work, use this one practical advice for motivation. Very important

Wow it of all. I hope you feel better and of all, I can give you my opinion as a girl some girls like skinny guys im one of themconfusion. I really do fine, skinny guy really attractive. And there is other girls that, like a guy that has more meat in his bones keep trying youl find someone that loves you for what you are not for what you can do. I know it sounds cliche, but believe me, there is a lot of fishes in the sea. Someone will love you. Have you thought to yourself? Maybe your significant other is in other country. Also, confidence is key. If your confidence, people will find you attractive. Dont give up happy face or smiley

I felt this way at for what it is worth. I am now and I have a masters degree, an amazing job and a loving husband. It does get better. I would see a doctor about the depression you are clearly experiencing. Sometimes antidepressants cause weight gain, so maybe that would help in ways.

Title: I feel like im going to end.
Thread
Over the past few years of my life, I have been what I think is depressed. I have never got medical help or mental help with this, and can only judge what I think is wrong. And based on the fact that I cannot get out of bed most days, small tasks feeling like end of the world, zero motivation for anything in life and constant, unintentional self sabotage, ink. What else it could be? Now, the main thing going on right now is I feel zero motivation in my life, meaninglessness and intense loneliness, coupled with lack of self confidence, as for the motivation. Getting out of bed is a chore. And when I do, I sit in my room all day and either use dopamine escapes or feel sad for myself. I have allowed my schooling to suffer since I have zero motivation, which is a stark contrast to who I was at the beginning of my degreeconfusion, I am letting myself go physically. Everything that was once fun is now numb. I either numb, scared, anxious or sad at all times, I have not felt actual happiness in yearsconfusion. I know I cannot talk to my mother or my friends, as my mother overreacts. And the times I have brought it up to my friends, they are like, oh, omg, that sucks like they have to, but it feels like they are doing it cause they have to, and its a nuisance, and they do not really care. As for the loneliness iHave never been in a relationship I am. And the reason is I was bullied for being fat till I was, and I moved every years since the grade these coupled together have left me now with zero self confidence and a severe lack of social skills. I do not think I am unattractive, like I am probably like a or, but I have no value. I have nothing to offer any partner or person. I am not super funny. I am not opinionated. I do not have skills or an important job. I am shy, not outgoing, etc. Recently, I have started using dating apps and I get few matches. But then the talking stage starts and ink what to do as I have never experienced this stuff. Every encounter I get ghosted. I am really scared to ever meetup cause never been on a date. But this constant ghosting is killing me. My confidence and mental health are gone atm, like I had a silent scream, cry, dryheave anger fit in the dark at am today. Ink. What to do? I feel? I be alone forever. I am talking to this girl I really like atm, but I feel she sees me as an annoyance, and I can tell shes slowly losing interest. This is destroying me as I love her style and humor and art and, etc. I started to show the real me, and she is probably not interested if I do not find love by the time I am, I amKilling myself I have toyed with the idea over the last few years a few times and feel its really the only option I have not aspirations or plans for the future living is hell im always scared or anxious im a disgusting troglodyte and deserve it.

Title: Therapy hopping.
Thread
Over the past year, I have entered therapy after bouts of poor mental health, just for each counselor to conclude after a few weeks that there is not anything to clinically acknowledge I new to therapy, but I have always struggled greatly with what I thought were depressive periods, social and general anxiety and poor body image. I get these cycles of feeling really bad, and all the sudden, when I see my therapist, the feelings evaporate. Different counselors have said something along the lines of you seem okay, so why are we here? Please? If you have similar stories, lik or even any advice I would really appreciate, it is so frustrating and confusing when I get these crashes out of nowhere, and I do not have the tools or knowledge to approach

I am in a super depressive state. At the moment I am unmotivated. I do not know what I will not to do with my life. I took a break from college because I needed money to save, but my job is draining me. And if I only go to college, then I will not have any money coming in. I do not know what to do. I cannot take working here anymore. Everyone at work tells me I am emotionless, and quite frankly, that is true. I need help. I need to change my attitude, my terrible routine, the way I think I feel like I am about to explode and go insane.

Title: My best friend chose to get laid rather than celebrate my birthday.
Thread
So for many years, I have hated my birthday. Long story short. It is never been about me due to my classmates and or family ignoring me. Something bad had always happend and shit just sucked. Last year, I went through a breakup with a previous best friend on my birthday, and it fucking sucked. My current best friend said that he promised that the next year will be better since I would live a lot closer a year passes. And a, about weeks ago, he started talking with someone who he met on tinder. I was really happy for him, and I genuinely was. Some red flags has popped up, but she seems like a cool gal, but during a talk over week ago, he mentioned that this weekend he was going to go visit her, leaving the, which is my birthday. I did not mention it at first thinking he must have forgotten. So let us see how long until he realizes he realizes it and goes very underwhelmingly in the beginning of a league of legends game. Oh, it is your birthday. That is all he says to begin with. Time goes by. I tell him, it kind of sucks. You are leaving on my day, but I want him to meet her inside of me. I really hope he chooses to be with me as he promised he can meet her. Another time, right? They just started talking. He says, he will come by in the morning after work to say hiBefore going to her place its better than nothing and I look forward to it finally the day and he does not call it gets closer to the time where he has to leave for her and he then texts me saying he will not make it. He does not even suggests that I just meet him for a bit by the train station ink why but I am just so fucking heart broken that he chose a girl he had known for less than a month over his best friend of almost years. I fucking took him for an awesome fucking tent trip in the woods because he was sad no one was celebrating him I did everything I could to make him feel as important as he is to me because he is but I feel like I am less than a random girl online there more to the story. And I know I might be selfish, but I really had hope that this year would be different. I am giving up on my birthday. Fuck this shit

I also want to add that he has not even called me like he said he would to check up on me.

Title: I think there might be something wrong with me.
Thread
I have no one to go to so I will just have to use reddit for this one. I have this constant urge to do horrible things such as murder someone or emotionally torture them in order to drive them to icide beat someone until they are half dead etc there something wrong with me I think I would not say these are intrusive thoughts as I willingly think of this stuff and surprisingly enough, they do not make me uncomfortable in the slightest. If anything, I enjoy them a lot I enjoy thinking of being in control of something so major and seeing terror on a person face while I beat them and I enjoy thinking of someone taking their own life because of me. I am very concerned due to this, especially as I have always been quite violent and know that if I had a chance I would do all of these I do not know what exactly I am getting at right now. I guess I just want someone to confirm that this is not actually normal or even tell me what could be wrong with me. I am not sure I just want someone to acknowledge that it is concerning. So I actually feel worthy of getting help or something
Comments
I would not get too wrapped up on labels friend, but yeah, it is not okay or normal or healthy. But I am certain there is nothing inherently wrong with you and nothing permanent, but you are causing yourself damage and need to cultivate a culture of healing rather than one of abuse. Usually, this stuff is more about neglecting a horrible trauma, keeping it locked away in a part of yourself. We all have that part of the subconscious that carries unpleasant on our behalf. We are not supposed to keep anything locked up in there. We are supposed to get ourselves to safety generally to a home with family. This is not a place or people, but rather a feeling a very specific feeling. And too often, these days, the house we grew up in never created this in usconfusion, so we do not experience that relief of emptying this bin. Having a home and family means to be supported by those who care about you emotionally, who would protect you from all harm, who express their love for you with affection. It takes energy to seek this out, and often would be going against natural instincts of someone filled with shame, pain and rage. They would see it as giving up in a weird way in order to heal from this stuff, you to attract it back, promise, everything will change, and you take care of it from a place of compassion, patience, no judgement and love. This is supposed to recreate thatFeeling of home, family and love inside yourself, between your heart, mind and soul. To understand this negativity comes from something that happened to you when you were innocent. And it is that hurt, innocent child that you need to acknowledge, go back for and help out of the venom he was lost in. That is what it means to learn what it is. Give it love in exchange for its pain. To treat it the way the best father in the world would treat his child, basically the opposite of what an avoidant, neglectful, possibly abusive parent would treat their child, which can be difficult, after all, it is our parents who are the ones who taught us how to feel about ourselves. Now, you say they are not intrusive thoughts that you enjoy them. I am going to assume these are directed at someone specific someone you hate, or is it generalized towards everyone? People who annoy you, people you are sexually attracted to. We are filled with bizarre quirks from the taint of early childhood abuse. It is not until that lost. Part of yourself tells you who it is and where you went from astray from it that you be able to be in a position to repair your relationship and give it the love. It may not even realize it is missing. What is your inner voice. Like I imagine it is not a very positive relationship you have with yourself. If it is demanding you harm others, it is oftenDue to being trapped in unprocessed, shame, rage and pain from early childhood, accumulating more trauma as you continue on, until you heal your relationship with yourself.

Title: How is it supposed to work?

I just started therapy a couple of weeks ago for depression and a couple of other issues. I have not done therapy in over years. And from what I remember, the therapist drove the discussion this person I am seeing now expects me to drive, and it feels like a lot of pressure. I do not always know what to bring up. Last sesh, we talked for minutes and organically, something good came up to talk about is that how it should go? I mean, I guess all therapists are different, but was not sure if this was commonplace.

As you said, all therapists are different. Some are great at leading a session, others are not. But that does not mean they are a bad therapist. They most likely do not know you well enough to make assumptions as to where you want the session to go. What I have done to help is one of two things. I either sit down the day before or a few hours before the session and write down things I want to address. Another option is to jot down quick notes throughout the week, confusion between visits. I have also heard of other approaches, such as writing down your past or major events that you need to focus on or detail your current issues on paper. So you have a reference

I have distanced myself from almost everyone in my life that now they think of me as a completely different person than what I actually am. I cannot seem to be able to discuss my problems.

Im not a licensed therapist or anything but I am the same way when I open up to anyone I consciously realize that it is therapeutic to release my feelings and emotions physically speaking to someone helps me process my thoughts in a way that speaking to myself will not accomplish but this ted talk changed my life hope. This helps.

Title: How to stop the feeling of life just falling apart.
Thread
Lately, I have been feeling like I have no control over my life. Everything is just falling apart. Relationship, marriage, finances and my own mind. The stress is overwhelming, and a lot of that stress is tied to my finances, taking a big hit over the last few months, I am hopeful that the next few months will be better, but we never know what life holds. How do I stop the constant panic anxiety attacks and the feeling that life is falling apart? Are there mental exercises or other resources I can do to help myself? Thank you.

There advice from experts for panic disorder in my recent comments when you are worrying, you are not really thinking you re just spinning your wheels when you are calm you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it think about the worst thing that can happen how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent don make mountains out of molehills. One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It very simple although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits, a really simple but effective thing the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath the evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It used in treating anxiety, depression and ptsd. Video the stanford ptsd studyconfusion soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing, rushing around when you do not have to. And doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness. Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners videos on youtube. Other things take some effort, but theyAre very rewarding things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art or volunteer work, take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices. This is one of the articles online with advice for therapeutic comfort. The best stress management is personal. Deal with things that are stressing you. This has lots of useful information about two psychiatrists who recommend a program of mind body methods with attention to breathing, and the lifestyle program for stress and depression developed at the unit of kansas

I am years old and am obsessed with my future, success and fame. I have the feeling that if I do not become a grammy oscar, nobel prize, olympic medal or whatever winner, my life has been worthless, that then I have not had the impact I should have had wether, its on the world or its citizens through giving them inspiration, I have always set the bar high for myself, because not reaching goals makes me feel worthless. This often gave me a lot of stress in high school, because anything less than a an a was like a failure in my eyes, even though I have never been pushed to strive for great achievements by my family. At first, my drive to inspire people came from a genuine point, but now I feel like I just do it because I want people to look up to me and my achievements. I have talked about this to family because I cannot get therapy, atm, but they do not seem to understand it. Just accept that a simple life can be fulfilling, too. Life is not about reaching goals, but about happiness, but my mind does not work that way. I do not want to die, to just be forgotten again. I want to leave an impact. And if I cannot, then I have thrown away my opportunity. I only have years or so on this earth, and every year I am losing one. If I do not make it soon I will have wasted itAll I need advice because it is becoming overwhelming sometimes, especially because I cannot decide in what field I want to become successful, what I want to focus on, considering I have many interests and passions.

No matter what you do, it will all be for nothing and forgotten, even winning a grammy. Your life is a spec in infinite time. Someday, the world will not even exist. There nothing wrong with striving for goals like that, but making that the soul focus of your life will never fill that void. You all be dead anyways. So it is not like you will be around to enjoy the legacy signed a very unambitious person.

I know what you mean I often feel the same way but I also know where it comes from a lack of validation you feel like you do good but noone has some good words for you so you try harder setting the goal higher in the hope to get that validation most of this happens subconsiouslyconfusion but you don getting the noble price would be a form of getting that but it will not fix the problem be then you got validation only for that one thing I suggest that instead of hoping that your work sparks some nice words try to look when you get nice words either for seth you did or simply existing or anything elseconfusion and accept those it hard I know when my parents told me how good I did in my finals I turned it down knowing that I could have done way better if I had invested just a bit more time and effort when I had an internship last week and the people there told me how good my work was I turned it down be I know I could have done better but not achieving your own goals and there are not any other real goalsconfusion does not mean you did not achieve anything I recommend a video from cop grey your theme I know he talks about new years resolutions in the video but he is still right about the goal issue he basically recommends that if the direction of your actions is correct orBetter than in your pastconfusion. You have achieved something, and that is a something you can and shouldconfusion. Be proud of.

Title: I cannot stop lying.
Thread
I cannot stop lying. No matter how hard I try not to lie, I lie to avoid problems and to make others feel better. I also lie to get attention from others. But most of the time, I just lie without any reason. I consider the consequence of lying, I think before I say something, I already got into trouble because of lying, but I really can not stop lying. Is something wrong with me? Or probably that is just my personality.

Title: Feeling stuck.
Thread
Its been a difficult time the past few months and I do not know what to do. Theres been a few good moments, but it feels like things are just getting worse the only things that help are my job and sport and outside of that, I just have too much time by myself, with the things I do not know how to deal with. Its gotten to a point where I keep having thoughts of hurting myself, feeling tempted to use drugs and even suicidal thoughts I am fighting to not give in to those things ive been clean for almost years now but it is really getting hard. I do not understand why do I struggle so much with my past? Some recent issues and these thoughts, while at the same time, I do things every day that feel like they should be way more difficult than the things I struggle with.

Title: I hate life.
Thread
I am turning this year and have never been on date. No girl has ever shown any sign of being slightly interested in me. I have no friends. There is people I talked to, but they never ever text me. And when I do it is usually a dry generic convo. I installed tinder to try and talk to people, only to realize I rarely get matches because I am ugly, but that I also have no social skills and will not even start a conversation, because I am afraid to. I am extremely fucking skinny. I am around it. Confusion and I weight like keg. I have tried so hard to gain weight, but it is just impossible. I ve taken meds, I eat a lot. Nothing ever works. However, the moment I do not eat something, I instantly lose weight, and I cannot but wonder why this happens to me. I am not good at anything. I play games for most of my day and I am not particularly good at anything. I played this one game for over hours, and I am probably barely above average. I am not good at drawing. I am not good at sports. I joined the football team a few years ago and was decent, but barely ever played because of being too skinny. One time when I did come on, I heard someone from the other time make fun of me. I took this course for my years of high school and I hated it, mostly becauseI suck at it and cannot learn anything for some reason. The only subject I was good at was english. I from portugal, so it is my and languageconfusion, and honestly, it is a mystery why it, like I have always known english despite it not being my first language. I used to watch this show called top gear with my brother and read the subtitles in portuguese, but I kind of already understood what they were saying. I started having english classes in the grade and already understood it.

I am sorry you are going through this for the weight thing. Your metabolism sounds like it is extremely fast, and I am no, doctor. So take this with a grain of salt, but adding protein and possibly going to the gym may help build muscle mass so you could gain weight without having to gain fat that your body will not produce. But that is just my thought tho ink. If it would work, not being good at anything same, I am turning and I literally suck at everything and have one friend, and it is rough. But if you have get a job, work friends can be a thing and have helped me a bit. Self improvement and confidence can get a you long way. I wish you luck.

Definitely not okay you feeling numb about it does not mean it was okay or that it was not abuse you should maybe consult with therapist or talk to someone about it unresolved trauma can bring on different issues and get worse with time.

Cuz I do not even feel love. I just feel so anxious around boys. I look goofy, I do not have any dream. Cuz the only dream I had is impossible to achieve. It have high standards for beauty confusion. I think this time I will give up for real

Youre looking at things through depression glasses, which make everything look worse. When you recover, things will look very different. Problems that seemed hopeless will suddenly have obvious solutions. A lot of things can help standard treatments and the self help recommended by therapists. I have advice from experts in my comments, and you can click on my name and read. The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It very important to calm down. This will make you feel better. And let you think clearly, a very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical behavior therapy, which helps people who have bad, recommends this breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out and breathe seconds in breath and seconds out, breath till you feel ok. Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down. Also a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call

Title: The first time I went to therapy was because my mom wanted to know what was wrong with me once she knew that something was up, she never took me back.
Thread
It was in middle school, and I do not remember much of it, but I remember that I did not know how to socialize or approach to people. One day, I was crying and having a mental breakdown, and my mom got so mad at me because I would not stop yelling and sobbing. A sudden point, she said that we needed to go to the doctor, and I was asking her why she told me these exact words we are going to a doctor to see what the is wrong with you. Total confusion did not know what she meant. We got into the car and we went to a weird place that I do not remember what it was. Exactly. I know for sure that there was people that where, waiting in the hallway and some of them where injured. They called out my moms name, and we went into an office. They where, sitting, two woman, they started to ask me questions like how I was doing and what I liked to do in the free time, etc. I did not talk because of anxiety, literally not a word. A sudden point, they asked if they could talk to me alone without my mom. She said, yes, a sudden point. I just started crying after she left the room, I was telling them that I did not want to live anymore, and that everything was so stressful for me, specially at school, because everyone was making fun on me. They continued asking meQuestions and told them that I was not happy and did not want to do anything, because I felt like it would serve me no purpose. I talked to them for an hour after that, they let my mother in. They told her that I needed to come back because clearly something was wrong, and they needed to starting sessions with me to help me out. Once we got home, my mom really got angry at me. She literally told me that all that was a waste of time, and that, of course, something was wrong with me, but she did not want to spend another penny on me for my problems. Now, thinking about all that makes me understand a lot of things about myself and my past

I have zero ideas of what I am going to do with my life. It makes me very anxious, especially these days its been a hard few days. I find it harder and harder to look forward to anything, even things I like to do, like sportsconfusion. Anyway, she asked me what I want to do for a living after uni and I just snapped at her, telling her that I did not know, because it immediately made me anxious and angry, and I panicked.

I always thought that this rare calm light feeling I sometimes get on sunny days where I can keep the windows open was nostalgia for when I was a kid and would constantly be out or happy in my room.

That sounds like a beautiful realisation to me. I understand the sadness that comes with it though my mental health struggles swallowed years of my young adult life and sometimes I am grieving and mourning this loss it often makes me sad and angry at the same time that there was so much heaviness and darkness throughout those years then I struggle to accept and let go but when I do and I can cherish the sunny content days even more so as I never take them for granted

Things I often tell young people if you cannot see a therapist, self help is better than nothing. A lot of people benefit from it. Self help is a way to show you are serious that does not create friction in the family. In fact, it would not be surprising if your parents liked some healthy changes in your behavior. Self help can be educational for parents as well as kids. A good self help book explains what therapy for depression is like with depression. There is what seems like a catch. People say, I know there are things that will make me feel better, getting exercise, taking care of myself, straightening up the house and cleaning, but I am depressed, and I do not have the energy here. The thing very important people do have energy when they are depressed as much energy as they always do. But for some reason, the system is reluctant to let you use your energy. We have to use psychology to coax energy out of our systems. Psychology has some nifty tricks. A famous psychiatrist, abraham low, said that when we cannot control our feelings, we can still control our muscles. If you tell your arms and legs to get you our of bed or to the bathroom for a shower, they will obey. Try this when it seems that you are too tired to work, lie on the couch, close your eyes and get ready to work by imagining yourself working for minutes. This is a motivation trick.That is been used in behavior modification programs since the if a task seems like it is too big, think of it as a series of tasks that you can take on one at a time and start with something really easy cleaning start by cleaning for, or min, and take a min break. Homework, start by proofreading a paper or previewing a chapter you are going to read by looking at headings, sub headings, etc. You do not have to be an athlete to benefit from exercise as little as min, brisk walking a day can help, and you can add to that gradually so long as you do not make yourself sick of exercise with too much and quit. Steve ilardi, the therapist researcher who headed the lifestyle depression project at the unit of kansas, talks about enjoyable ways to get exercise. If you go to metapsychology, you can read a psychologist review of do ilardi book splendid confusion of all the traditional mind body practices, meditation, etc. Confusion. The one with the best evidence for affecting mood disorders is yoga, breathing, slow breathing is used for treating anxiety, depression, panic disorder and ptsd. It safe, and it does not take any training video below details about self help based on cognitive behavioral therapy and lifestyle choices that help with depression, nutrition, basic lifestyle things like sleep, exercise and social support. Also traditional asian methods. It has advice specifically for depressed students always remember that there are people you can talk to like aSchool counselor. My comments have good info for coping in a crisis including the nigh hotline.

How do you even find the power to get help some things have happened to the point my depression and anxiety have gotten so bad I cannot eat or sleep for days or get myself out of bed I have never had any form of treatment except pills I can get on occasion I do not know how to bring myself to do whatever you have to do to get help how are you supposed to do this when things are at the lowest point
Comments
I think sometimes you do not get help, and you just have to suffer through it short term, but eventually you get up. Getting help is not some huge binary thing. I think it is a lot of tiny things. Maybe start with going for a walk, connecting with an old friend, trying a new hobby.

Ive been struggling quite badly with my mental health since I was. Im now, and its worse than ever, and all my options are either expensive or risk, my relationships changing, and I cant afford either of those right now. I feel so alone, and I think im becoming suicidal, but if I talk to anyone about it, they just worry and be sad, and I dont want to hurt anyone or make them see me differently. Ive had to open up just a little about my anxiety, which is only a small part of my big problemconfusion. And all my teachers and my parents are treating me weird, and its scary, and I definitely cant open up about anything else. Plus, I dont think my brother understands mental illness, and whenever he talks about it, he thinks of lonely, sad kids as freaks and thinks anorexic teen girls are embarrassing, and that so is for attention. And I dont want him to think of me as any of that frown, sad, angry or pouting. Im seriously worried and suffering, but no one else knows what im going through. And I dont know how much longer I can do this alone. If anyone has any resources where you can talk to professionals for free, I would really appreciate that. Thank you.

If you live in uk there is textlines you can use to talk anonymously to someone who is been trained to listen to and it is over text so you do not have to deal with the anxiety of actually speaking to them I forget the names exactly of these resources but if you look up free crisis text line you should be able to find something it are not perfect but it helps I used them a few times in my darkest place when I just wanted somebody to listen to me I think shout is one of them if you do not feel comfortable doing that or you do not live in uk feel free to do me at any time we are both anonymous on here so it will not ruin ur self image and it will not be a burden on me as I do not know ur going to be okay ik you have likely been hearing it all your life and you do not believe it anymore and it is been so long and it is not fair but I promise youl be okay even if it lifes starting to feel hopeless you can do me to get anything off ur chest I have an older sister who struggled with similar issues in terms of anxiety until it got to a point where she attempted suicide at around she had ongoing issues since she was young but she is now and has a career and is doing slightly better everydayDoing a job she is passionate about so there is a light at the end of the tunnel for do me if you want to vent or anything because we do not know each other and never really will so there is no complications or judgement for your issues hope this helps I should also add that it is better to text them during the daytime because if you text these resources at night there is high activity and itl be much harder to get through to someone youl be doing better one day my sisters a living example of it even if it takes a very long time and you feel like you cannot take it anymore you can you have made it this far and even though you are likely very tired of it you have the strength to be happier even if you do not believe you do I also struggle with anxiety and I know how horrible it can be but I am still going edit I also struggled with so if you mean the same thing as meconfusion when I was in a dark place and I still sometimes feel the urge to do it so you are not alone in that regard even tho I do not know the half of your situation

Im very sorry your going through all this. I know what its like to have anxiety and to worry about how people see you. I have autism, and most of the time, when I tell people they look at me differently than before, like, im a weirdo or something, thats why I usally dont tell people anymore. Im often alone and depressed constantly. Ive also thought hard about suicide, but I feel like its not a good idea for anyone to try. I sadly, dont know any free therapists or anything like that. If I may suggest a few things, though, try writing in a journal and write as if you were telling all your problems to someone who you trust a lot. Take a long walk to clear your head or just go outside and sit in silence for a bit, just get out of the house. These are what I do to calm myself. Im sorry if they dont appeal to you. I hope you will get better

Title: Intrusive thoughts.
Thread
I have an intense fear of social shaming and social rejection, and I worry too much what other people think mean. Words on the internet from years ago stick with my and haunt me, repeating in my mind over and over on a constant loop. It worse, when I am accused of doing things I did not do. This is affecting my ability to enjoy life and function on a day to day basis. I cannot read a book or work or eat a meal or do anything without these memories parading constantly through my mind. Can anyone offer any advice on how I can just get the voices to stop? To be clear? This is not a schizophrenic kind of thing. I am not literally hearing voices. I am just remembering them constantly, and I cannot enjoy life and feel terrified to interact with anyone, even just online, in case they say something nasty, I will believe it, and it will stay with me for months, at the least and years at the most, maybe even forever. I still remember nasty things. People said to me on message boards when I was fourteen, I had to stop listening to rock bands I once liked, because their fans were mean to me. And to this day, I still cannot listen to them because whenever I do, the voices start up again

The most common cause of intrusive thoughts is depression. Ocd can cause intrusive thoughts. I suggest talking your problem over with a professional and getting a diagnosis.

Hey, it sounds like you may be experiencing ocd. It can be so mentally debilitating. Seeing a therapist who specializes in ocd could help a lot.

Like you said, it is a fear. We live in a distorted culture where we do not care about one another, but instead constantly judge, compare, project compensate for our insecurities. So it comes as no surprise to me that you are feeling the affects of this sick culture. We re all human. We learn by making mistakes. Happy face smiley I have made some fine ones in my time, and I am going to make many more name me a single human that is perfect. No such thing except shaq. Of course, lmaoconfusion. The question you need to introspect to yourself is why do you value this fear of rejection or social shaming. Happy face smiley maybe you need to change your values to suit your needs better wink or smirk. Just let it go. My friend. Happy face smiley you do not deserve the torment these unrealistic standards of society impose upon us time will burden your regret if you take them as failures instead of a triumph in the opportunity to learn, laughing, big grin or laugh with glasses, intelligent people like yourself are always full of self doubt where as the village idiot is full of mis placed confidence demonstrates how society is hurting us. Video in reasoning, critical thinking

I really do feel this. I am in my, but sometimes late at night, I find myself paralyzed by fear when something I said on the internet years ago pops in my head. You are not alone. In that sense, I do not know what exactly in clinical terms is happening to us. Ptsd episode, anxiety, intrusive thoughts. It probably a combination of everything.

I do not always think like that but from time to time the thought that my friends actually find me annoying pops up in my mind I may think that they actually do not like me and just put up with me even tho I know it is not true when I will look at it from the logical side and not how I feel I can then clearly see that what I feel does not make sense, but it kind of annoys me

I have been thinking about my friends too. They say, I am cool and everything but that I do not fit in. They do drugs and party, and it is just not my scene I agree with them, but do not know who I fit in with. I am goth and on the lookout for people like me.

Title: Advice on a friend with delusions.
Thread
Tldr. Should I go along with my friend delusions or tell her that what she says is not true backgroundkiss. I confusion am from the uk, but have been living in ethiopia for the last two years. Healthcare here is pretty rubbish. Mental healthcare is virtually non existent. Bear in mind, there are very few licensed or qualified psychiatrists, a lack of nursing, even in private hospitals. And overall, a very low level of support for people with severe mental health difficulties, even if you can live independently if you cannot work because of a mentalconfusion disability, the welfare and social support systems are very poor. The issuekiss, my friends, two sisters, both late, let us call them for older and for younger, who is my very close friendconfusion, have been what I can only describe as spiralling into a hole of paranoid, delusional hysteria. Over the last six months, they lived together and smoked a lot of weed, but both have experienced childhood sexual confusion, abuse and trauma, which is not necessarily relevant, other than the fact that it might be towards the end of. Bear in mind, the civil war in ethiopia was reaching a bit of a heightconfusion. They both became convinced there is some kind of devil lesque ai to human takeover. Kind of thing going on with people in white hats that might be after them. They think this is at odds with the orthodox church that they both are members of, and so wonder whether the devil is somehow afterThem they think these people took over their phones and laptops so they gave them away they think they might be responsible for the end of society somehow and talk about how this is some real black mirror I it a lot and very difficult to explain after a recent episode with wandering around the city in the middle of the night trying to tell them something they were admitted to a psychiatric ward this happened because I and other concerned friends called their relatives in spain usa who then came over for an interventionconfusion current situationkiss they are now in a facility with very little medical attention I only found out where they were a few days ago their phones have been off for two weeksconfusion and went to go see them today the place they are in is not great imagine there is a to room with no window and about ten airport style chairs. There is a ping pong table but no bats or balls there are people burning trash outside the bedroom windows. There is neither soap nor toilet brushes in the bathrooms because of a lack of funding. You get it I do not think they are receiving any other counselling therapy of any sort, I know, is medicated with four pills each night, but is not. I do not know who is in charge of this facility because nobody was around to explain it to me from what I can see. It is a kind of safe space, but withNo real support system or medical service provision mentioned someone coming to talk to them bout their issues once a week. It does not sound ideal. I went to visit for the first time today. They were both still very delusional, much more than we sat in their room for a bit. I walked around the grounds with while she talked about her delusions actively and with vigour, but also mentioned being here to get better confusion. So it is a strange dichotomy of a very confused person knowing, on the one hand, that they have a problem, but on the other, truly believing in the aforementioned delusions. I am not a mental health professional. I am just their friend, and I am going to keep going to visit them twice a week for a couple of hours a time and bring food and things to do. My questions are, what do I say to them about their delusions? Do I tell them they are not real? Do I let them talk it through and be a passive listener? Do I try to bring them back to the real world? Am I an enabler? If I just hear them out and then say it does not sound right to me. But hey, who knows? I am afraid of pushing them away. Especially she needs a friend. Thanks. So sorry. If this is a burden, I am just at a loss here? Any advice is much appreciated

Title: My best friend chose to get laid rather than celebrate my birthday.
Thread
So for many years, I have hated my birthday. Long story short. It is never been about me due to my classmates and or family ignoring me. Something bad had always happend and shit just sucked. Last year, I went through a breakup with a previous best friend on my birthday, and it fucking sucked. My current best friend said that he promised that the next year will be better since I would live a lot closer a year passes. And a, about weeks ago, he started talking with someone who he met on tinder. I was really happy for him, and I genuinely was. Some red flags has popped up, but she seems like a cool gal, but during a talk over week ago, he mentioned that this weekend he was going to go visit her, leaving the, which is my birthday. I did not mention it at first thinking he must have forgotten. So let us see how long until he realizes he realizes it and goes very underwhelmingly in the beginning of a league of legends game. Oh, it is your birthday. That is all he says to begin with. Time goes by. I tell him, it kind of sucks. You are leaving on my day, but I want him to meet her inside of me. I really hope he chooses to be with me as he promised he can meet her. Another time, right? They just started talking. He says, he will come by in the morning after work to say hiBefore going to her place its better than nothing and I look forward to it finally the day and he does not call it gets closer to the time where he has to leave for her and he then texts me saying he will not make it. He does not even suggests that I just meet him for a bit by the train station ink why but I am just so fucking heart broken that he chose a girl he had known for less than a month over his best friend of almost years. I fucking took him for an awesome fucking tent trip in the woods because he was sad no one was celebrating him I did everything I could to make him feel as important as he is to me because he is but I feel like I am less than a random girl online there more to the story. And I know I might be selfish, but I really had hope that this year would be different. I am giving up on my birthday. Fuck this shit

That sucks. I guess many people choose relationships over friendships just because they expect more fun from it. You all have to get used to spending less time with him because he now has to be elsewhere more often, I wish you best luck for the next birthday and hope you somehow find other joys in life that make it easier for you to deal with this situation.

Title: My own thoughts are causing me extreme trauma.
Thread
Hello, I need advice on how to deal with this. I have experienced no real trauma in my life, but I have traumatic thoughts or disturbing thoughts that come to me in flashbacks and cause extreme levels of stress and sudden jolts in my body. I have tried therapy, but no therapists know how to help me because they say I have no trauma I tried sari, but two of them did not work, and I feel that others won. I almost tried to take my life. I am so fricken desperate.

If you go to the amazon ad for the ptsd sourcebook by do glenn schiraldi, you will see from the reader reviews that people with the disorder really appreciate this book, which says that there is a variety of symptoms associated with ptsd, some of which respond to self help. The book has a chapter on intrusive thoughts. Other problems cause intrusive thoughts, depression and ocd. I have advice from experts about these in my comments.

Title: The first time I went to therapy was because my mom wanted to know what was wrong with me once she knew that something was up, she never took me back.
Thread
It was in middle school, and I do not remember much of it, but I remember that I did not know how to socialize or approach to people. One day, I was crying and having a mental breakdown, and my mom got so mad at me because I would not stop yelling and sobbing. A sudden point, she said that we needed to go to the doctor, and I was asking her why she told me these exact words we are going to a doctor to see what the is wrong with you. Total confusion did not know what she meant. We got into the car and we went to a weird place that I do not remember what it was. Exactly. I know for sure that there was people that where, waiting in the hallway and some of them where injured. They called out my moms name, and we went into an office. They where, sitting, two woman, they started to ask me questions like how I was doing and what I liked to do in the free time, etc. I did not talk because of anxiety, literally not a word. A sudden point, they asked if they could talk to me alone without my mom. She said, yes, a sudden point. I just started crying after she left the room, I was telling them that I did not want to live anymore, and that everything was so stressful for me, specially at school, because everyone was making fun on me. They continued asking meQuestions and told them that I was not happy and did not want to do anything, because I felt like it would serve me no purpose. I talked to them for an hour after that, they let my mother in. They told her that I needed to come back because clearly something was wrong, and they needed to starting sessions with me to help me out. Once we got home, my mom really got angry at me. She literally told me that all that was a waste of time, and that, of course, something was wrong with me, but she did not want to spend another penny on me for my problems. Now, thinking about all that makes me understand a lot of things about myself and my past

Title: Feeling down and lonely when mates reject on suggested plans.
Thread
Hi. Confusion. Ive always had problems with over thinking, a small bit of anxiety and a bit of paranoia brought on from certain habitsconfusion. Most problems happen with the overthinking. So basically, the past years, I have lost a handful of friends. Nothing bad happened. We just went out separate ways. I dropped out of college and decided to work full time. From this, I felt like I have lost contact with all college mates. When I ask if they want to hang out or grab a drink, sometimes there, free and are available to chill, sometimes not with me working days a week and them in college, I understand that it is difficult to arrange stuff. But every time I ask and there to busy, I just cannot help but get an overwhelming feeling of sadness. When I see all my other mates together, I then start to overthink that they do not want to be friends anymore or just work. My self up to believe I have no friends. I live by my self and have been for year. Does anyone know how to help with loneliness and how to prevent thinking like this when rejected? I hope this makes sense. Thanks for reading, leave and love

Title: Dreadful thoughts about my wife.
Thread
I am not sure if anyone else has experienced something like this, but I have no clue how to address this. I love my wife very much. She is the person I was meant to spend my life with. Shes my rock, and I would be totally lost without her. Over the past few years, I have been mentally freaking out at certain times. Here are a few examples amp I text her good morning while at work, and she does not respond. Hours go by and I panic on the drive home for lunch, I am imagining walking into our house, and she is dead in the bed somehow. But when I get home, she is deep cleaning our daughters room, and her phone was in the kitchen. She leaves the house to go pick up some milk or whatever, something that should only take about or minutes. She gone for almost an hour. I start to worry that she was killed in a car crash, or she was kidnapped, or she finally was fed up with me and decided to just leave for good. But then she comes home with bags from different stores. Becasue, she decided to shop for more than what she originally needed to go out for. When I feel this way. I dont start calling and texting over and over becasue. I know it is just my mind fucking with me. I dont know why I get this way. I am always so scared something will happen, and I willLoose the love my life forever. I am not sure what causes this. Maybe a fear of abandonment. Has anyone experienced thoughts like this? Are these just considered to be intrusive? Thoughts help.

Anxiety issues exacerbated by an insecure attachment you have with your wife? Does it come from needing to always be prepared for? The worst bad things happen all the time. Most bad things that happen are ones we never saw coming more? Often than not, nothing bad even happens, but our anxiety cause us to suffer as if more than one horrible thing, the worst thing imaginable did happen, and if it did, you will go through it twice and often nothing would change. Always trying to be prepared for the worst might have saved you a couple times from something bad, turning out worse, but it is not worth destroying our state of being over ruining our life. I am sure I do not have to tell you our life becomes hell with so much worry. We go through these horrible events in our mind, even though none of them ever even happen. What is that worth? Can you sit with those feelings? Listen to them, respond to them after you understand where they are coming from, refuse to give in to the anxiety with reason and logic. Tell it there is just as much evidence that she is fine and doing something else. Calm it down. Give yourself love, slow yourself down. Everything outside of the moment we are currently experiencing is an illusion.

Title: Dreadful thoughts about my wife.
Thread
I am not sure if anyone else has experienced something like this, but I have no clue how to address this. I love my wife very much. She is the person I was meant to spend my life with. Shes my rock, and I would be totally lost without her. Over the past few years, I have been mentally freaking out at certain times. Here are a few examples amp I text her good morning while at work, and she does not respond. Hours go by and I panic on the drive home for lunch, I am imagining walking into our house, and she is dead in the bed somehow. But when I get home, she is deep cleaning our daughters room, and her phone was in the kitchen. She leaves the house to go pick up some milk or whatever, something that should only take about or minutes. She gone for almost an hour. I start to worry that she was killed in a car crash, or she was kidnapped, or she finally was fed up with me and decided to just leave for good. But then she comes home with bags from different stores. Becasue, she decided to shop for more than what she originally needed to go out for. When I feel this way. I dont start calling and texting over and over becasue. I know it is just my mind fucking with me. I dont know why I get this way. I am always so scared something will happen, and I willLoose the love my life forever. I am not sure what causes this. Maybe a fear of abandonment. Has anyone experienced thoughts like this? Are these just considered to be intrusive? Thoughts help.

I heard a podcast about cut that was using these exact examples of how it can help with this type of anxiety. Have you looked into the abc method?

I cannot say for sure, but yeah, this can be fear of abandonment or maybe even anxiety. I would recomend therapy, because living with this thoughts on a long run will not be good for you, neither for your relationship, take care.

Title: Adderall is vyvanse for anxiety.
Thread
Good afternoon here is a bit of background information. I have been seeing my psychiatrist since, and I want to say that within that past year and a half or so, I seem to have found a cocktail that works for me and my mental health issues, with the exception of one thing I have been on adderall since, and only within the past year I have noticed that this. It is doing more harm than good for my mental health. It used to worked absolute wonders for me, but now it makes me incredibly anxiousmore, so physically anxious, which leads to mentally anxious. If that makes sense, I am also pretty irritable when I take it, when I do not take it, though my concentration is crap, no matter how hard I try to focus, vyvanse is something I am unfamiliar with. But I have heard from two people that I work with, that it works just as well as adderall, without the anxiety, irritability. And it does not make you crash as hard does anyone else have any experience with it? What have you noticed? Does it really have less of those side effects, or is it just the same as adderall?
Comments
I have the same issues and used to take vyvanse and I hated it. I hated how it made me feel like it sucked the personality out of me. It made me anxious and a cold person, but it did help get more focusedand. I am afraid I will have to go back on it for all those reasons.

So anything related to those medications is considered a stimulant, and one of the major side effects of that type of medications is that it can increase anxiety since your anxiety already increases activity in your brain. Adding a stimulant can further increase that activity. I have anxiety with concentration issues. And the only thing that is managed to work for me was treating the anxiety first and then managing the concentration from there. Its a difficult process.

Ive tried adderall, vyvanse and ritalin. They all have exacerbated my anxiety symptoms. Thats only my experience with the drugs. I felt that ritalin has had the least negative side effects. Vyvanse was a train wreck for me. It raised my heart rate a ton, but no irritability, although its a miracle drug for some people. So keep that in mind, the effects vary. I take stims as needed for my adhd, instead of on a regular schedule, so that I can manage my anxiety better.

Title: The first time I went to therapy was because my mom wanted to know what was wrong with me once she knew that something was up, she never took me back.
Thread
It was in middle school, and I do not remember much of it, but I remember that I did not know how to socialize or approach to people. One day, I was crying and having a mental breakdown, and my mom got so mad at me because I would not stop yelling and sobbing. A sudden point, she said that we needed to go to the doctor, and I was asking her why she told me these exact words we are going to a doctor to see what the is wrong with you. Total confusion did not know what she meant. We got into the car and we went to a weird place that I do not remember what it was. Exactly. I know for sure that there was people that where, waiting in the hallway and some of them where injured. They called out my moms name, and we went into an office. They where, sitting, two woman, they started to ask me questions like how I was doing and what I liked to do in the free time, etc. I did not talk because of anxiety, literally not a word. A sudden point, they asked if they could talk to me alone without my mom. She said, yes, a sudden point. I just started crying after she left the room, I was telling them that I did not want to live anymore, and that everything was so stressful for me, specially at school, because everyone was making fun on me. They continued asking meQuestions and told them that I was not happy and did not want to do anything, because I felt like it would serve me no purpose. I talked to them for an hour after that, they let my mother in. They told her that I needed to come back because clearly something was wrong, and they needed to starting sessions with me to help me out. Once we got home, my mom really got angry at me. She literally told me that all that was a waste of time, and that, of course, something was wrong with me, but she did not want to spend another penny on me for my problems. Now, thinking about all that makes me understand a lot of things about myself and my past

I had a similar experience with my mom when I was. She took me to see a doctor so that I could get on antidepressants. When my mom was out of the room. I told the doctor about my suicidal thoughts. When my mom came back in, the doctor told her I needed to see a therapist because antidepressants alone are not going to be enough. My mom never booked an appointment for me when we went back a month or two later for a check up on how the meds were working. My doctor was surprised that my mom had not gotten me in to see a therapist. The doctor was very adamant about me seeing a therapist and was basically begging my mom to get me help, because she knew how important it was when we left, my mom was so pissed off at the doctor for making her feel like a bad mom. Then she looked at me and said, im not a bad mom, am i? And I was like, no. And then she was like, so you do not need therapy, right? And I did not know what to say. So I just agreed that I didnt. She made it seem like, if I said, I needed therapy, then that made her a bad mom, like, bitch, this has nothing to do with you laughing out loud. But now years later, I am getting the help I need. I also now know that my mom could have also benefited from seeingA therapist. Part of me kind of cannot blame her, and another part of me will never forgive her.

Sounds like your mom was really troubled and you had to suffer under her. This is a great story on how parents can be complete pieces of shit and fail us. I was in the grade in. They called me out of class and told me to wait outside this office door. A couple minutes later, a nice lady called me in and we sat and talked for an hour. I remember only being confused why I was there. She gave me some tests to take, blew through them. No problem. She smiled and sent me back to class. I was a high energy kid, never did homework, sensitive as hell. My father was a work, a colic. Several businesses kids mom took care of everything in the house and was overwhelmed. We grew up pretty poor in a upper income township, so that was an issue with other kids. When I got into middle school, I ended up drinking by the grade, and school slid into the crapper. Funny thing was, I would get a in certain classes and fail others. Somehow, I graduated. Things got better in uni, but after not so great, I know your pain. I ended up with sever depression anxiety. In adulthood, alcohol issues lost three fantastic girls in my bla got better, quit. Alcohol, had a rough career in business, retired early, alone. But happy hope to hear how your are doing and what happened. Thanks for posting

Thank you for sharing a really similar thing happened to me as well. My parents have gotten better now that I am an adult, but I resent them sometimes for not getting me help earlier.

Title: The first time I went to therapy was because my mom wanted to know what was wrong with me once she knew that something was up, she never took me back.

It was in middle school, and I do not remember much of it, but I remember that I did not know how to socialize or approach to people. One day, I was crying and having a mental breakdown, and my mom got so mad at me because I would not stop yelling and sobbing. A sudden point, she said that we needed to go to the doctor, and I was asking her why she told me these exact words we are going to a doctor to see what the is wrong with you. Total confusion did not know what she meant. We got into the car and we went to a weird place that I do not remember what it was. Exactly. I know for sure that there was people that where, waiting in the hallway and some of them where injured. They called out my moms name, and we went into an office. They where, sitting, two woman, they started to ask me questions like how I was doing and what I liked to do in the free time, etc. I did not talk because of anxiety, literally not a word.

I swear. Just ask your partner to wear condom, abort the kid or send them to adoption if you are going to treat them like this? Ifs she a nasty woman? And a joke of a mother is not there another adult in your life that has a brain unlike your mom.

Psychology always asks, what is wrong with you? The real question should be what happened to you?

Same. I just wish I was normal. Instead of having mental breakdowns, I have gotten help, but it is still hard. I have ruined friendships for stupid shit, said stuff that I should not have been an asshole. It makes me feel so sick. And the worst part is all this shit starts when I am having a mental breakdown last time I had a bad one was during the beginning of bona. I just wished I had been taking my meds and I ended up making myself look crazy infront of a friend.

I had a different experience, but similar sentiment. My mother once tried to get me on adhd medication because that wouldnt be her fault. She blamed my dad for having itconfusion, but that didnt just magically medicate the procrastination out of me. And in reality, I had anxiety, which she was not interested in dealing with once I finally did get help and she found out how bad off I was. She basically said, yeah, I knew something was up. I think in her mind is, was supposed to sound like she was not totally ignoring me when it really just sounds like she knew I needed help for years and did not do anything, hope you are doing better. Now,

Title: Feeling down and lonely when mates reject on suggested plans.
Thread
Hi. Confusion. Ive always had problems with over thinking, a small bit of anxiety and a bit of paranoia brought on from certain habitsconfusion. Most problems happen with the overthinking. So basically, the past years, I have lost a handful of friends. Nothing bad happened. We just went out separate ways. I dropped out of college and decided to work full time. From this, I felt like I have lost contact with all college mates. When I ask if they want to hang out or grab a drink, sometimes there, free and are available to chill, sometimes not with me working days a week and them in college, I understand that it is difficult to arrange stuff. But every time I ask and there to busy, I just cannot help but get an overwhelming feeling of sadness. When I see all my other mates together, I then start to overthink that they do not want to be friends anymore or just work. My self up to believe I have no friends. I live by my self and have been for year. Does anyone know how to help with loneliness and how to prevent thinking like this when rejected? I hope this makes sense. Thanks for reading, leave and love

Ive found that the less friends or opportunities for authentic, meaningful social interaction I have, the more I blame myself for missing those opportunities. I know how that feels. I currently do not have any friends not to shift the focus on me. I know this is not about me right nowconfusion. So even when a cousin or a sibling cancels a plan with me or forgets to say, happy birthday, it ruins my week. And then I feel like a failure, a nobody, etc. It spirals into a whole crisis and questioning of my self worth. Sometimes I just drive for hours playing a sad sufjan album on repeat. Sometimes I walk around petsmart and hang out with the cats. Sometimes I go for a walk in a secluded part of town. Therapy would probably help, though I have not gotten around to that, but maybe it would help you

Same for me not just salads, but raw foods in general and veggies, but the chlorophyll from leaves in salad is really helpful. Veggies are nature medicine, junk food and chemicals in food will make you feel worse.

Title: Generalized anxiety recovery.
Thread
More than a year that daily I suffer from generalized anxiety keeps getting stronger and worse. I was wondering if anyone anywhere has recovered from anxiety, like, is it eternal? Or will it heal someday somehow?
Comments
I have been taking medications since I was diagnosed a little under four years ago. If you have as savvy a psychiatrist as I did, medications can do wonders. It is important to find one who can listen to what you say and understand why you respond the way you do to things. I will not tell you that generalised anxiety disorder ever completely goes away. I am not a doctor. I am not a neurologist, and I have never heard of anyone telling a convincing story about it going away. But it is possible to turn the volume down and learn to cope with it. My psychologist taught me a breathing exercise during a time of incredible crisis that turns the intensity down a fragment. I am currently taking vortioxetine and lamotrigine, and they turn the intensity down to the point where I can read about people doing things or hear people saying things that well let us just say would put me into very aggressive moods without having. Those very aggressive moods do not be afraid to explore options. I had to be convinced to try each of the medications I am taking or have taken for my mental illness esconfusion. But I find it difficult to imagine going without them. And if you can find people to talk to people who are helpful to talk to, that is also a great tool

Title: Insecurity.
Thread
When I left school to move to another one, I removed all my friends at that time from my instagram because I did not like them, except one who I liked. And then towards the end of leaving them, I was burnt out, like, what do I do now? And when I gave it a thought it was not because I hated them, but was because I was embarrassed of how I behaved in the school. I moved to another school, and I started pleasing people, so they like me. And for fucks sake, they dont. Its just me making a fool out of myself, and the cycle keeps fucking repeating. I was at a science fair today, and this girl I do not even know, went behind this guys back and whispered so dramatic ew, when I was speaking, what the fuck is wrong with me? Oh god, I hate it here. What to should I do to stop repeating these patterns? I like being around people. I am just not funny. Not interesting until I fake a friends personality, and then they actually listen to me. Except this faking is so mentally draining. Also, they girl I liked, also moved to the same school as me, and now I fucking hate her. I need help.

Title: Is it okay to feel like nothing matters?
Thread
I feel it all the time ever since I became an adult. Really, I am now, and it is worse than it is ever been. I think the most impactful events to me was losing my cat, a horrible, prolonged situation with my ex, cockiness with my parents and becoming lucid to their possible emotional abuse and just work in general. My cat was the only person who ever truly loved me. Unconditionally, she and I were very close. She was my best friend. She was my reason for carrying on every day. I have been thinking about her lately. I guess the whole horrible situation with my ex and ex friend and coming to terms with my childhood and relationship with my parents has lead me to feel unlovable or like peoples love is conditional, and I am not deserving of full love or good treatment. Everything that happens feels like it beats me more and more into self loathing. I have not worked ever since. Couid shut everything down, and I am working again. Before this, my job was a part time baking job I could kind of pick the hours for. It was a morning gig, and I had the entire afternoon and evening to myself. Before that was an animal shelter job, which took every scrap of time away from me, and the work environment was abusive, but I was happy being around the animals all day, I love animals right now. I am working an afternoon, evening night job that isPhysically taxing and I feel like I have no life left and not even any sort of way or reason to spend the money I make on I do not even know if I can attend school and even if I do it would still be years until I could have my dream job I bet school would give me anxiety just as bad as work anyway I guess suicide to from here on I do not really consider myself depressed though I am in a prolonged depressive mood, I also do not consider myself suicidal because I do not want to kill myself. But I wish I never was born or that I just did not exist. I do not feel sad or anything, even if day to day, I do get sad, but thinking about my life, it just feels empty and pointless void of any emotions, even depressive emotions, it just absolute pure apathy. I am existentially apathetic, but day to day, I am very emotional, sad and miserable and self hating. I guess I do not see a point to my life. I do not really have any desire to kill myself, but I do not want to live years just working and going in and out of failed relationships and having my pets die, having to live the rest of my life without my baby girl ginger. If there were options to choose a different way of life, I would but work and school are unavoidable pets dying in an inevitablyAnd relationships failing will happen. It feels like I am backed into a corner, and my choices are to live a life I will never be happy with or just kill myself. I do not want those two choices, but that is all I really have. I do have a therapy appointment set for the end of march, but even with therapy, my life will not be any different therapy, and medication really is just a cope, not a solution. There really, only one solution to escaping your life. It is to kill yourself with a bag and helium and die just like ginger died.

Cats are great judge of characters they do not make up any of the arbitrary reasons humans do to like or dislike us they just take us as we are with that in mind you cannot be unlovable if your cat loved you I am so sorry for your loss I know how tough it can be if you have the motivation to give your life more meaning because it definitely already does have meaning but if you want moreconfusion perhaps you could contact a local animal shelter and see about becoming a short stay cat foster parent I hope this helps

I dont feel like anybody is ever there for me in my life, the people im with on a daily basis in school, my teachers, my family. Any time I try to explain whats happening, its always shot down with them telling me to improve. I dont feel like I can do anything in this situation. At school, people are constantly taking my kindness and calm nature. Most of the timeconfusion to exploit and beat me around. People throw things at me because they know I dont want to start fights, people hit me because they know I wont hurt anybody. People rely on me for supplies and answers, because they know id feel bad if I didnt help them. As far as teachers go. I have one helpful teacher. However, most of the issues with students happen in that class as hes really chill and thinks were playing around, despite me being vocal to him about how it makes me feel. Another is fine.

Where are you from? The great problem of this world is incompetent fathers who are not up to time, try to be financially independent, learn the best you can make contacts, hang out in the end. F ok, the primary family forever and try to make another better. They will not change since they do not need to change.

Title: I feel like nobody is ever there for me except one of my friends.
Thread
I dont feel like anybody is ever there for me in my life, the people im with on a daily basis in school, my teachers, my family. Any time I try to explain whats happening, its always shot down with them telling me to improve. I dont feel like I can do anything in this situation. At school, people are constantly taking my kindness and calm nature. Most of the timeconfusion to exploit and beat me around. People throw things at me because they know I dont want to start fights, people hit me because they know I wont hurt anybody. People rely on me for supplies and answers, because they know id feel bad if I didnt help them. As far as teachers go. I have one helpful teacher. However, most of the issues with students happen in that class as hes really chill and thinks were playing around, despite me being vocal to him about how it makes me feel. Another is fine.

Title: What the right way to deal with that.
Thread
I mess up when trying to make friends with people, and I said sorry to those people. Now to the quesrltion, what is the best way to repair that? In one of my last posts I wrote about a person who said that she thinks I can get better at talking to people while at the same time doing stuff that clearly says you cannot become better at that. Now, what would be an appropriate reaction to that? Can I say, hey, your actions contradict what you say? And can I say, plus, do not be to hard on me. I am just learning how human interaction works. It feels like this would ruin much more. But I think it is also somewhat justified, and also is telling my version of things. A hey, I am in a shitty situation. So when I screw up noone is allowed to judge me, be for me saying sorry and telling why I screwed up is more of a I know I screwed up, and this is my last ditch attempt to save whatever I can and then let the topic rest forever. After. I mean, I have the hope that others view my mistakes as less bad and more forgivable, but I still view them as mistakes, not as I was right. In doing that be, I did not know better, it so confusing, and I do not know what is right anymore.

I am autistic as well as mentally ill. So I will share some wisdom from the autistic side of the coin. Once you know yourself your general character as a person and how things make you feel that should be your base for whom you share your time or make friends with never change to suit other people, change to suit yourself. My saviour psychiatrist told me that people fear what they cannot understand. This applies to all sorts of interactions. Humans claim to be open minded all the time. But if you do not wink, blink and twitch the way they want you to at the times they want you too. They get all pissy about it. I added that last sentence anyway, one thing I strongly advise is to develop a sense for when people are worth the effort and when they are not. I grew up surrounded by people who have a substantially lower iq than me and found it much easier to conduct conversations with individuals significantly older than me. Ie, eight year old me talking with a fourteen to sixteen year oldconfusion. I am always available to talk during my waking hours, so I can always go into more details. But think of this as a primer. It is a human right to feel comfortable in one own skin. But the first step towards that is to become aware of what your skin truly is that is the hardest and eventually most rewarding part

Title: Generalized anxiety recovery.
Thread
More than a year that daily I suffer from generalized anxiety keeps getting stronger and worse. I was wondering if anyone anywhere has recovered from anxiety, like, is it eternal? Or will it heal someday somehow?
Comments
Everybody experiences anxiety, but clinical anxiety is defined by having these symptoms on more days than not for a sustained month period, so as soon as one no longer meets that month criteria, they technically no longer qualify for this diagnosis. There is research suggesting remission is very much possible and would be expected with an evidence based treatment for gasadness.

Title: There is nothing wrong in my life.
Thread
But I feel like a loser all the fucking time. I think people are always judging me for my actions, even though I do not care about them. I overthink everything to the point that it starts to suffocate me. I started therapy, but I feel down every single day I need help, but I do not know how to get it.
Comments
Therapy is a long process that involves a lot of the therapist getting to know you professionally. They have to figure out your thought process and which parts of it are hurting you. That is a difficult task. So feeling down when you have only started, therapy is not something to beat yourself up over. Talk to the therapist honestly about your feelings, and if you feel you need a serious intervention do not be afraid to say. So what I mean by serious intervention is medication or even hospitalization do not be afraid of those things. They are difficult processes, but can have positive effects.

Title: Hello there everyone. I recently had a situation regarding talking to people about the subject of mental health and would like your thoughts if possible.

Hello there everyone. I recently had a situation regarding talking to people about the subject of mental health, and would like your thoughts if possible, to help you undertand the situation. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and depression by doctors at a young age. My years have been geared toward achieving a high quality of life and to not be held down by these labels. As such, I have been engaged in activities such as public address, announcing volunteering in mental health advocacy events, I mental health, phone linesconfusion and also engaged in public speaking events and competitions. Talking about dealing with my diagnoses and overcoming them in short, mental health is a passionate personal subject for me, and something I am open to speak to others about. I work at a university part time in canada, announcing sporting events and work with students. I early confusion, as I work with them on a weekly basis, I make the effort to communicate with them, get to know them better and to pull them from their phones every once in a while. Haconfusion. I recently had a conversation with a co worker. Early confusion regarding mental health. She initially had an aloof nature towards me for a few months, was not sure if she liked disliked me as she initially talked to everyone but meconfusion. But as time went on, she warmed up and we have many pleasant conversations I nature, yoga, career aspirations, sports, etc. Confusion, which encouraged my talkingAbout mental health with her. In canada, there is an awareness campaign created by the canadian telecommunications company bell canada in an effort to raise awareness and combat stigma surrounding mental illness in canada. They call it bell let talk. They heavily promote it in february at the school. Our conversation about this campaign lead to the mental health topic, where I asked this person, what is your perspective on mental health to which she answered that? A loaded question. And at this time, I cannot give an answer in all my years asking this question to thousands of people. This was the first time I ever got an answer as such, and it has left me wondering the next time I talked to her another event shiftconfusion, I noticed that she was more reserved than before. Short answers hi and bye, approachconfusion, seemingly more aloof to me than I have ever seen her. The questions I have are as follows, what is your take on her response? Was I out of line to ask the question should I pull her aside and address the situation? I asking her to? Let me know if I ever hit a sensitive nerve with herconfusion. The last thing I look to do is to offend people? And as I work with this person, I do not want to make her or anyone feel uncomfortable in a work situation. Any chance to hear your answers would be greatly appreciated. As I do want to understand other perspectives and learn waysOf navigating future conversations with others regarding mental health. Thank you.

Title: My boyfriend is struggling.
Thread
I have been with my boyfriend for months, and I love him so much. He was a health care assistant on the couid ward during the peak of it, and saw many people die alone, too busy to even sit with them and hold their hand. It really affected him. We started dating only two weeks after we met on tinder, so I do not even know the full extent of his mental state as he has not shared it with me yet. I know he experiences severe nightmares less now than he used to, but apparently it still happens every few nights, confusion. He will not say what they are about. But apparently, a patient called alan keeps coming up in the dreams, who died alone, begging and crying to see his family one last time, there was nothing my boyfriend could do. He takes mitazapine, a fairly heavy antidepressant sedativeconfusion every night, and he does seem to be sleeping better lately, he is been tracking his calories, eating more veg, drinking less beer, and making sure he gets out for regular bicycle rides. He aims for miles a week, which is not much for himconfusion. At this same time, I am in the final year of my university teaching degree. I graduate in may and have worked so hard for the last three years to get where I am. I am on my final placement right now. Working days a week am in a class of year olds. I am teaching and planning independentlyOf the time and it is genuinely exhausting. I have a commute of almost an hour, so you can imagine, I only really get to see him on weekends, and I am asleep by am. Every night I text him every morning with the usual I going to be super busy, but I hope you have a good day. I message you when I can. I love you and phone him every evening. I see him on weekends when I can, and I am also juggling a part time job. The nature of the job means I only get the opportunity to work once or twice a month. The pay is a day for very easy work, so I really cannot afford not to work. I have a car, food and rent to pay for these last few weeks. My brain has just been so frazzled, I forgot I had a shift booked in after I had already promised to see him. And he got very annoyed with me. He did not seem to understand that I really have to work and it is nothing personal. He knows I have a little money saved, but I do not really want to be burning my savings. If I do not have to. He asked me if he should start booking shifts on the days I am coming down because that what I do, he said. He feels like he is second priority at the moment and was getting tired of me prioritising other things. It happened againToday I told him I had agreed to go to a friend birthday party on the completely forgetting that it was his birthday I was going to go see him on the anyway but he was very upset that I forgot understandablyconfusion I immediately cancelled the party and said I was going to come and see him but he said I should go as I would obviously rather be there I apologised profusely apologising that I had not made him enough of a priority but he is not reading my messages now and declined the call when I phoned I am so worried about him I know he does not really mean what he says and it is easy to take things personally when you are suffering from severe depression he also had issues lately with his work paperwork and has been unable to work and earn any money for weeks so there is money stress involved too I know it is a lot of stress and anxiety all coming out sideways but I am on my final assessed placement that I have worked years for at the moment I will admit that he is not the biggest priority in my life he does not seem to understand how important this is for me I do not neglect him and I do what I can but it obviously is not enough I should have been making him more of a priority but I do not know what more I can do I have a lot ofPlanning and stuff to do I already do not get any time for myself I have weeks of the placement left to go and I am so worried he just say he does not want to see me anymore he asked me before we started dating if I wanted to wait until after I graduated as I knew I was going to be crazy busyconfusion but that was before I knew the full extent of his mental health and I said no what can I do to show him how much I care about him

Title: How to tell if you need the hospital or not.
Thread
I have been suffering from paranoia and instruive thoughts lately. It has gotten better, but months ago, it was really bad everyday. I kept on thinking my food was poisoned, carried weapons. Every time I went outside also would have episodes of delusion, where I will, for some reason, think I need to save the president. Thankfully, I had my family there to keep me in place, keep me from running out and going nuts. Like I said, it has gotten better. They are not happening as frequently. The fear is not as intense, but just in case. In my next episode, when would it be the right time to admit myself or my family to admit myself I have been holding up okay, not anywhere near to how bad some people cases are? I would say that I am quite scared. What I may do to myself during an episode, insight is gone in a flash, and I get so absorbed within the intensity I lose control over my body. Is that enough of a reason to admit someone? Do you think if it gets bad again? I will need the hospital. This will be helpful in the future, so I could know then and avoid possible harm.

As a rule, hospitals do not admit people without a doctor say so. And I imagine that in the current situation, professionals swamped with people asking for help because of the lockdown. Hospitals are even more reluctant to admit people. What someone with your problem has to do is confront the unrealistic thoughts with reality checks. Calm down by breathing slowly and think, ask yourself for evidence that supports the unrealistic thought you should be able to see. There is none. It very important to calm down. This will make you feel better. And let you think, clearly, a very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly, dialectical behavior therapy, which helps people who have bad, recommends this breathe, gently, hand on your belly, to feel it go in and out and breathe. Seconds in breath and seconds out, breath till you feel ok.

If you feel yourself beginning to decomp, then go to the hospital and explain it, they would probably offer you to go up on a voluntary status. But if it is managed currently then waiting for outpatient does not hurt.

Is it possible for you to see a doctor, psychiatrist? They might be able to work out how to lower the odds of it happening again and figure out a plan for what you should do if it does otherwise. When you feel unsafe, I would err on the side of caution and head to the er, because what you are going through does sound serious.

Title: I am wondering.
Thread
The last time I went to my psychiatrist, she said that I am suspected in having psychotic disorder because I told her that I have been hallucinating a lot these past few months. My mother also said that she saw me zoning out or talking randomly, with no one else being there. And some of my friends said, I act weird in some occasions, but I am in doubt it is true. Tho, that I frequently hear some voices or seeing things everytime I close my eyes and it creeps me out. I am active in self harming for years, but I never heard someone telling me to actually harm myself badly, as clear as I have been experiencing lately few years ago, I am really scared. One night, I was one inch away from my veins, but I was shaking so much that I dropped my blade instead, I am scared. I do not want another diagnosis. I do not want to have another mental illness. Is there any way to get rid of these intrusive thoughts or whatever it is by myself? Is this just because I am exhausted, or my brain is just really active. It creates some imaginations.

That is really unfortunate. Maybe you will get another diagnosis. I hope not. Maybe you are experiencing delusions, and it is an illness. The best that you can do without a doctor is vent. Express your emotions with art and writing that a step towards the right direction. But this is serious. You need to be diagnosed or have some medication, it may hurt, but you are not okay. Like this, I cannot solve your problems, but I will always be here to provide support and listen.

It sounds like you are a very troubled person. This is reddit. No one here can diagnose you, but it honestly sounds like a schizophreniform disorder. Your symptoms are not likely to go away on their own.

Title: Generalized anxiety recovery.
Thread
More than a year that daily I suffer from generalized anxiety keeps getting stronger and worse. I was wondering if anyone anywhere has recovered from anxiety, like, is it eternal? Or will it heal someday somehow?
Comments
Anxiety is part of life. We all have it to some degree. What you are talking about is an anxiety disorder that people recover from, although there is always some anxiety because we are human, most people with anxiety disorders do better with therapy, cbtconfusion than with medicine, and some are successful with self help. Based on cut. I can show you some cut self help. But first, I want to say that recently, there has been very impressive evidence for therapeutic breathing. When we have a lot of anxiety, it puts worrisome thoughts into our heads there. Two ways to get rid of those thoughts. One is just to calm down. The easiest way to do this is to breathe slowly till you feel ok. Two psychiatrists brown and gerbarg say a or min slow breathing exercise is good, and min twice a day is a therapy for anxiety. The exercise is inhale and exhale, gently. Seconds each when you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it, think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent don make mountains out of molehills. When you use the thinking brain you get control of the emotional brain and you feel better, also replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts, count your blessings and remind yourself of your successesThe treatments for anxiety range from simple stress reduction methods to therapy and medication don overlook stress management it can help even with very bad anxiety video a lot of helpful information including the part program of brown and gerbarg.

For me, I have a very unhealthy relationship with food. I love junk food and eat it a lot. I know it does not fully sustain me, but I love it. When I actually put good food into my body, I a salad or a meal with a bunch of vegetablesconfusion, I feel so much more energized and overall happier for me, I think eating those healthy foods sends my thoughts into a positive place. If I can eat vegetables, maybe I can start working out. If I can start working out, maybe I can fit into those jeans again. Its like a way to make yourself feel better as a person and to become more productive and energized. And it all starts with vegetables. I hope this makes sense, and was not just a bunch of word vomit, smiling face with smiling eyes,

What are the basis for this to an extent its perfectly natural to have these thoughts I think of bad things all the time but its also important to realize even with how traumatic said thoughts can be in some sense of clarity they are out of our control. I am terribly fearful of a killer asteroid or a massive tsunami but I also, in some way take comfort knowing I cannot do anything about either situation. They re out of my hands but that does not make them less scary. Embrace these thoughts let them stay for a moment and then exile them from your space of reason.

I do not know if this applies to you at all but some people who have real life trauma can completely forget what happened yet still get flashbacks that make them panic even though they do not know what it is from just a thought if it is not that I have no idea what would cause it but I hope you can find help eventually.

For example, there is a simple but effective remedy for recurrent nightmares.

So if you are driving around in a car that is got issues randomly seizing up the engine and screaming brakes, you would rather wait til it is sitting on the side of the road burning to get some of the problems taken care of. You can find help. People do it all the time. It might not happen immediately, because, dude, the entire mental health community is so med and everyone has waiting lists. I am on a couple of them. Teletherapy is a normal thing. Now, too, I think you having that really su tidal sometimes is a huge clue that you do need help. People who are not in need of help do not have that

Well as someone who made it years before my crash and is now being held in a psych ward, I guess all I could say is that the help has been pretty good and the drugs seem to bring more clarity and calmness. It sucks. Being one of the nurses zoo animals. So if you can get care before you make the decision to check in or check out, I would recomend it.

Title: Stuttering depression and many othe issues in life dilemma.
Thread
Hello. Thank you for taking a few minutes for my problems. I am a doctor of medicine, a man. I am a public health specialist. I am years old, related. I have no children and have never been married. I come from an eastern european country. I have a lot of problems, and I suffer from depression. My problems are related to family work and human relations. I do not like my job. I was trained to be a doctor. Instead, I stare at meaningless numbers on the computer. I deal with health statistics or in translation, collecting incorrect numbers. I have no chance to work as a doctor in my country because that job is reserved for the elite, connected by family, party and mafia ties. The crucial moment for my job was when my ex girlfriend sent me the message that she cannot be with me because of my job, because that job is settled and has no future. The college with whom I shared the office, who is an engineer, by the way, told me so that he could not sleep if he were a doctor of medicine and did the job like mine. My parents are doctors. They never wanted me to be a doctor because they kept saying that I was inactive, lazy and incompetent. They live in a small town without real life experience. Dad is the only one, and the whole world flattered him while they needed him. However, they do not need him today, he got me inLater years. My mother is much younger than he is. She is a pediatrician, but she never had patience for me. As a child, they have the greatest stress from me because I cried several times as a child, I was constantly insulted. Eventually, I started stuttering is my biggest problem. It is benign. I speak freely in front of a large number of people, but sometimes I stutter that why dad thought I could not be a doctor. He explained that patients will be bothered by my stuttering. A female colleague at work, who is two ranks above me, said publicly that I am a disgrace to my institution because I stutter. Of course, none of my colleagues and my superiors wanted to protect me when I complained to my father. He advised me to apologize to her to say to practice and to try to solve a problem. My mother did not want to take me to a speech therapist because she thought it was a psychiatric illness and that it would damage her reputation in society. She is very burdened by what other people think of her because of work and stuttering, I have almost no friends. At first, everyone laughed at me when I told them where I worked without further explanations. It did not bother me if, as it became more and more frequent, it hurt me I finished college on time with an average of I gave all the exams. The best I could I believe that is why theyLaugh at me. I chose the job to prove to my father that I was neither lazy nor parasitic nor incompetent as he put it. Unfortunately, I stayed here too long. I am not sure how to proceed. I live with my brother. He is a bit younger than me and very withdrawn. We chage a dozen sentences a week no more than that, never about our lives. He does not want to talk about his life, nor is he interested in other people lives. Last year, I accidentally broke the handle on his old door. The handle is worth liters of coca cola. Truly symbolic. I did not have time to change because the shops were closed. Saturday afternoonconfusion, he sued my parents. The problem is that day was out family patron day. If he had chosen any other day of the year, it would not have been such a problem as always. My mother cursed me and my father was silent. He just turns on. When I answer my mother, they cursed me for liters of coca cola. Of course, after all, I have seriously damaged mental health. I suffer. I am sad. I look at the world that lives and me that I am without any life. Now I have started to sleep badly. I wake up all the time. I cry. Often I used to be hard on tears now that I see someone is misfortune, hurts me a lot. The only ones left are my parents. They keep turning off thePhone. So I do not call them. When we talk little by little, my father threatens to call the police and put me in a psychiatric hospital for lifelong treatment. I do not remember drinking coffee with anyone. Story about. I realized that the whole world is only for the benefit and that everyone saw you as an opportunity to snatch something from you. Does anyone have any advice? People ask me, how is it possible that everyone is against me? My parents brother, colleagues and former friends. Amp thank you all, and I wish you all the best. May god protect you and your loved ones? Amp best.

Title: Seeking advice on abuse in relation to mental health issues, confusion.
Thread
My family abuses me, understanding that I am stigmatized for my mental state and my past. But it infuriates me so much that I react, and I understand the obvious solution being do not react. But this treatment is legitimately abusive enough to invoke the idea that a reaction is necessary to alleviate it. I know they manipulate and abuse me, but I do not know how to protect and defend myself in a way that cannot be taken and molded into a situation that is used against my favor. For example, a few months back, I would been on and off homeless because of the relationship between my father and i. He offered for me to return for a short time during this period because it was cold out, come to find out, my mother had expressed her disgust from the nursing home she lives in, and I assume, inadvertently ashamed him into offering helpconfusion. During the above, mentioned, short time, there was an argument, because I wanted to go look for an apartment and distance myself from my family and the treatment I would been receiving. I also had no vehicle, so I was getting a ride from my brother that worked in the town in which I was scheduled to view apartments. He and I argued, and I reacted by throwing a ad of his out of the vehicle. This turned into him stopping the vehicle and directing me to go find and return the ad. During this period, he acted as thoughHe was going to harm me. So I reacted with a similar threat, and I ended up being charged with assault with a deadly weapon. As my brother told the police, I brandished a pair of brass knuckles. Um, why? Lolconfusion and threatened him with them? Fast forward months, no weapon was ever recovered, and I am still facing charges in relation to that case. I do not have the money to handle this situation, and my court date is in less than a month. Is there any way to get the charges dropped or reduced on lack of evidence? Are there many options or suggestions for finding a place to stay while homeless and trying to hold job and start a second? How can I defend myself without it even being able to be mistaken as disrespect? I do not want to even offer the opportunityconfusion

This. I have struggled with this throughout my life. I have struggled personally in my past with suicide as well. I still have ideation more frequently than I care for, but have not had any attempts in well over a decade. The reason is empathy and empathy alone. I had a couple great friends succeed when I was younger, and as much as I love and miss them, I hate how selfish it felt to me and how awful I felt not being able to do anything to help them. And the helplessness of not being to go back and say, dude, guess what? I want this too, let help each other out so we can get better. You are not alone after having had that happen a couple times in my life. It really helps me personally deter any thoughts which might actualize into self harm of any kind, as much as I may think I want it. Sometimes, I do not want to force those feelings onto others, regardless of how I think they feel about me, because that pain I felt from those circumstances is still worse than the pain from any of my many other tragedies.

I would like to add here that the grief your family and friends will feel never goes away. My fianc lost his best friend years ago, years before we met, and his grief never goes away. He still misses his friend. He talks about him all the time without having known my fianc. When it happened. I can tell you with certainty that it changed him, and is probably the single worst event in his life. Every year, when the death anniversary comes around, he struggles a lot with his mental health. The first few years together, he would have these breakdowns around this time of year. It happened in februaryconfusion. And it really confused me until he explained that the death anniversary was coming up. If you are struggling, I hope you try to make it through today. Just one day at a time, don pick a permanent solution for a temporary problem.

Don kill yourself because it would inconvenience and upset me. Instead of guilt tripping people into staying alive. For our sake, we should be genuinely try to help them.

Title: A rant. My mental health is at an all time low.
Thread
To self harm, drug abuse, not sure if you need a to on this, but just in caseconfusion for some reason I am really going through it recently. I have never ever had problems with my before or very minor spells of anxiety, but I have never found myself like this it all because of a boy from my uni who I do not really like that much. He gave me a I ton of attention and told me he loved me and then slowly started reeling it back in. And for some reason, it has caused me to go through a mental breakdown. I have started self harming on a very intense scale. Ie I woke up with my sheets soaked in blood. I cannot really sleep at night. I have started doing coke again, but not just for nights out, but in my everyday life, I cannot keep up with my lectures or my uni work. I cannot eat. I cannot go home because I am scared my parents will be worried for me. It scares me that this has happened. All of a sudden. I am extremely worried for myself. I cannot tell anyone in my life, because I have worked hard to build a facade of never being weak in front of my friends and family. I have never cried in front of them. I am always the therapist of the group, and I want to keep it that way. Here is the only place I can really speak about this, justA rant really thanks.

Title: Bipolar.
Thread
I am male canadian, etc. I usually feel lethargic or unmotivated yesterday. I felt alert, alive and amazing, until the evening, I felt separate from my partner. I felt this insane rage and anxiety like a level. And today I have this anxious and hopeless and bound feeling. I have to see and face people. And this is bad. I know this is limited information, but what do you do to control this?

Title: I am a bereaved teenage boy.
Thread
I lost my parent months ago and I have seen changes in my behaviour and unconsciously do things like getting angry easily, which was not the case before her death. I easily get sad. Even for the smallest things, I randomly start to get tears in my eyes. Is this related with her death? In any way, what do I do to fix this?

I am guessing this is a stress reduction question. I tell you my best advice for stress advice from experts about other problems in my comments when you are worrying, you are not really thinking you re just spinning your wheels when you are calm, you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it. Think about the worst thing that can happen how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent don make mountains out of molehills. One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits a really simple but effective thing, the habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath the evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It used in treating anxiety, depression and ptsd video the stanford ptsd studyconfusion soldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing rushing around when you do not have to and doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness. Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind, you can learn relaxing tai chi exerciseFrom one or two beginners videos on youtube. Other things take some effort, but they are very rewarding things that make your life meaningful, like a good hobby, art or volunteer work, take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices. This is one of the articles online with advice for therapeutic comfort. The best stress management is personal. Deal with things that are stressing you.

Title: My mother said this.
Thread
Last year my mother had a medical problem that kept her out of work for more than months luckily, she is doing better now a lot better I know she is a strong woman but what she said about mental health lead me to here she one of those people who will say you need to keep on living no matter how much you hate it or depressed you are she told me many times that there are days where she wants to sleep more did not want to go to work, cook amp run errands but she needs to because that is going to help us in the long amp avoid homelessness. She asked me this question recently are you so sad? You do not want to eat? My answer no, do you want to eat even though your teeth are hurting? My answer not really see. I told you what she told after that is you can fight your emotions, but you cannot fight with your body. If your body is not doing well, you cannot do anything. But if you are just sad, you can still do things. She closes off the conversation by saying, psychical health is more important. In her opinion, I knew it. I know she is going to say it my mom also that after she did rehab, she felt better mentally, which I think in her opinion, one must feel better about themselves mentally if they feel better. Psychically, it cannot be the other way around. She hasA point, but is she right?

Title: I am so angry.
Thread
I am sorry if this is not worded very well it is been a while since I had to write something like this I am a year old male living with my girlfriend and our year old son my life is reasonably comfortable both of us work and watch our son taking turns about a month ago I have started to notice that my anger is starting to get out of control I get mad at the littlest thing and I cannot calm down I cannot talk my self into a better mood I have got suspended from work because I cussed out my manager over a miscommunication it was not a big deal at all but I could not stop being angry. My anger has no gage it is on or off its or it has became to a point I feel it physically. My blood pressure feels high, it feels like there is a itch in my chest and back of my head. I cannot scratch, if almost feels painful, that it self makes me more angry, like a continuous cycle for hours I value time a lot. And I have noticed that when things do not go as planned, even if it is only min late, it would make uncontrollably mad. I know in my head it is not a big deal, but I keep thinking it should not have happened in the first place and there is my girlfriend, my only support, the only one who I can vent and talk aboutMy problems, who now works more hours to cover my end and has to deal with me. I feel like a bum and useless. She tells me, it is ok and all I need is to get better, but I feel so guilty. I do not feel sad anymore. I feel anger. Instead, I want to cry my eyes out, but it is really hard. Weve made an appointment to see a doctor, and maybe I need med. I would do anything to make my self feel better. I just wish there was way to calm my self down or control my anger. I am so angry and miserable. I do not have much friends or people I talk to. So thanks to anyone who takes their time to read this

Title: Is it fairly common to think of ways to un life with no intention of suicide?
Thread
For as long as I can remember, I get passing thoughts of ways I could die, but they are not a result of over thinking. I know for a fact that I will not act upon them. In fact, after the thought flies by, I forget about it. Frequency varies daily a couple of times more when I am stressed and unhappy, very low to none. When I am out with friends or doing something I love, none. While on vacation, they are involuntary thoughts, and they feel trivial to me as much as daily. Low dose of stress, discomfort. I do not dwell on it. Mostly, they are what ifs, but they do not feel real. I live with normal amount of stress, and even if I do not actively feel happy most times, I am grateful for my life. I want to make sure that this is not harmful, because I mentioned it to my husband, and he was completely shocked. He pressed that I find help. Before this, I was convinced that everyone experiences this. Sorry. If this is not the right thread

Sounds completely normal to me. I think your husband just cares about you and maybe over reacted a little.

Title: Rock climbing anchors and emotional anchors.
Thread
As a rock climbing guide. I love metaphors for climbing and mental health. I hope this is helpful in rock climbing. There are basic type of anchors a belay anchor, and single climbing anchors. Belay anchors are used to belay a climber when the rope is already set up at the top. Single climbing anchors are used to capture progress when you are climbing from the bottom up. The ideal belay anchor is redundant and equalized redundant because there are at least and sometimes equalized components. This means that the weight is supported equally by all components, and should a component fail. You also have a backup, or when you climb from the bottom of the route to the top, and you attach to single climbing anchors on your way. As you climb most of the time, it is skillful to only put in one anchor at a time, and this vertically stack your anchors for backup. Putting in pieces at the same spot can be detrimental to summiting the climb, because it requires extra gear, more time and more energy. There is a balance between how many anchors you use, how often you place them and the energy required to stop and connect each anchor. As you acquire more emotional anchors and healthy coping skills you will learn when it is prudent to use each anchor, how many to use and how many anchors you need you will learn when to combine them and when to keep climbing. Are you belaying someone with the ropeAlready at the top, or are you putting anchors up as you climb, becoming more skillful using emotional anchors is the key to protecting your mental health in the climb of life.

Hi, I really sorry for your loss. And yes, this could be related. It going to take a long time to process and heal from this enough so that you can function again as you used to have. You considered seeing a therapist to help you in the meantime, make sure you take care of yourself sleeping, eating properly, exercise and maintaining good relationships, like spending time with friendsconfusion are all really important for health.

Title: Going to the psychiatrist for the first time.
Thread
So I confusion will go to the psychiatrist for the first time next week. I had a really hard mental breakdown after self destructive thoughts I had to call help hotline. Then I told my mom because she is very supportive. I am afraid of it, to be honest, because sometimes I think that I do not need to go, but other days, I cannot face the common things in my life uni partner and friend relationshipsconfusion. So I know that it will be helpful to exit the hole where I am. Anyone here went to the psychiatrist before. What are your experiences with going there?
Comments
Just know the psychiatrist is not like a psychologist therapist. I had that rude awakening at my first psychiatry appointment after going to therapy for many years. Sometimes not all of courseconfusion. They can be pretty blunt and unsympathetic, because their job is not to comfort you like a therapist, just to diagnose you and get you meds. I am sorry you are feeling this way. I hope the psychiatrist can help. I would consider a therapist too. Medication combined with therapy does a lot of good.

Title: What to do.
Thread
Honestly, im a bit stuck so im feeling horrible about myself lately I used to self harm about a year and a half ago and did it for the first time since then last week I have suicidal thoughts more often than I care to admit but they fluctuate. Some days im okay or fine as we put it on others it is real bad. I will not get into the reasons for why ive felt this way for as long as I have because that is a whole other thing. Now im from the uk. So would the best course of action be a amp or my go? Honestly, im kind of scared to get help and I do not even know why any help is appreciated

Title: Project to normalize mental health conversations.
Thread
My name is kristin, and I am looking for people who would be interested in helping me with an idea project I am working on. I am a fellow mental health sufferer supporter and started a page to help try to normalize mental health. I feel that the more we talk about mental health with one another, the more we can raise understanding, seek help and feel connected. I created stickers to represent the project, which I am calling green elephant project green for mental health and an elephant for lets talk about the elephant in the room. I am asking people to take a photo of the sticker with or without themself in itconfusion and share their mental health experience so that I can repost it to the project page to generate a conversation and help people going through similar things. My goal is to get the stickers around the country or possibly around the world someday to represent mental health. Please note, the stickers are dollars to cover the cost of production and shipping. If you cannot afford this, please, let me know. And I can try to arrange something else. I am not making a profit from this. Any and all proceeds are being donated to the brain amp behavior research foundation. If you would like to participate, the instar is greenelephantproject, or the website is greenelephantproject.

Title: I dont understand my mind and mental state.
Thread
He, him, yo, im sure noone will probably see it, and the few who see this will probably judge me. I just hope this is a kind of judge free space. And to the people who will read it, tell me what you think? I dont understand my mind. I pretty sure my mental journey started in april, not related to the pandemicconfusion. I was yo in julyconfusion and noticed for the first time that I was pretty alone and started having breakdowns once in weeks at the time, everything went drastically better. When I met her in september, it was pretty much the it person who cared about me. She noticed every little drop in my mood and made sure I felt loved, cared for, seen enough the whole pack important to mention that we were ldrconfusion. This went on until july. During this time, I ofcourse had breakdowns from time to time, but she always helped me getting through it. She never even thought about leaving my side in these moments. But I noticed in february march that she slowly got annoyed by it, even if she never said that I just had a hunch. Long story short, we drifted apart, she become more centralistic and cared less, and I became more dependent. My mood went more and more down. We argued and fought alot, and I always and still doconfusion blamed myself for it that I could have avoided. Most of them. I made her feel emotionally disconnected with me because of ourFights our daily talking went down to barely it. She often admitted that it was because she couldnt stand the constant fighting, like she always said she never blamed me actively. But she also never said that she has some fault. Sometimes I always apologized and put all the blame on me. If I feel like I made her uncomfortable, then the only reasonable thing is to punish myself lightly for it, like sleeping on the ground, denying myself something to eat, denying myself comfort items, etc. I always tried my best to make her happy. Somehow, like we always did in the beginning, I always saw her and will see her like the super caring person I can depend on. So I did until the end. She left me on december. The she said, its the best for the two of us. I accept ed it because I know its the best for her. She be more happy without me, and thats all I need her. Being happy in the past months, its been a rollercoaster, but in general, I dont like myself. I rarely feel like I dont deserve much. I always put myself last, and I extremely people, please, constantly, sometimes I have a high and feel pretty ok, but mostly im in a low and have like I call it depressive episodes. I dont think that im depressed, but from time to time, I have these depressive boosts. I start hating myself really much. I feel the urge to punish myself either.Lightly or by cutting. I never went so far and cut myself. Im just too weak for thatconfusion and had suicidal thought in really extreme cases, I dont want to seek out help, because I feel like I will only annoy whoever has to listen to me. I really consider calling the german telephone counseling telefonseelsorge. But I dont feel like my mental problems are big enough to waste a call spot there. Maybe someone who has it worse wont get help just because I waste someones time there lately. Its been ok. During the day, I am distracted while playing videogames with my buddy, but as soon as I go offline, I fall down a hole and am pretty surely getting a breakdown.

Title: A toxic relationship with a vile girl has left me emotionally unavailable and riddled with ocd.
Thread
Like the title suggests I am really struggling. I have tried a course of setraline, which worked in bringing my general levels of anxiety down. But lately I feel as though it is ramping up again. I do not want to get into too much detail about what went on with this girl. And in this relationship which happened almost three years ago, there is not much point. Long story short. She cheated on me. I beleive the experienced traumatised me. Somehow, I know that sounds dramaticconfusion. I took her back. I started to develop crazy levels of anxiety, paranoia and eventually ocd about erectile dysfunction, which led to ocd about my sexuality, which led me to question if I was actually gay this whole time, or if I have always been secuallty attracted to kids instead, things which were positively illogical. Needless to say, this was mental torture. I was in agonising pain for a long time. I began to hate this girl and want nothing to do with her. But I stayed with her for fear that I would only confirm my ocd thoughts. I even noticed my hair getting thinner, so that only made me want to stay more because I thought of how unattractive I am going to be, because I be bald. I convinced myself that no one could possibly love me. I could not sleep, I lost a massive amount of weight. I withdrew into myself quite a bit. Eventually, I spooked up the courage and left her. She triedTo get back with me, but I never entertained it, and I have not spoke to her again since fast forward three years, and I have not gotten any better. I have had extremely casual flings, which had no love or real attraction in them. I do not use tinder or anything like that. I got some awful news then, which only further hammered me into the ground. I picked up herpes from a girl I had a one night stand with, although I have since come to realise that herpes is actually not that big a deal. As I was led to believe, I still would rather not have it. So I do not have to tell future partners if there are anyconfusion about it. I suppose I wrote this because I needed to vent a little, but also because I would like some help. What should I do? What should be my first course of action here I need some direction. I see my friends getting married or having kids. They are happy and content with their partners lives. I am actually a pretty good looking guy. I not always nasty to myselfconfusion. So people often wonder why it is that I am single. I feel like it is almost considered weird, where I am from. I cannot imagine what it is like for the girls who are even a few years older than me. In my area. It seems like a lot of pressure. I am really quite a healthy person, and iWork hard at my job. I a teacherconfusion. I feel like I have got all the other aspects of my life down. I am fulfilled in those. Please. Has anyone gone through a similar situation? Thank you for reading.

Part of it might just be that it is fresh and nice to eat salad, but if financially accessible, maybe get yourself checked for vitamin deficiencies.

Title: How not to bother girlfriend with my depression

A few weeks, I felt lower and lower, and last night, I had a breakdown. It seems like I have a depression again. I had it a few years ago, so I basically know how to cope with this, but now it is a different case. Cuz now I have a girlfriend and I dont want to involve her in this.

Title: Finally, after months of waiting, I got a diagnosis. Any advice.
Thread
Hi. So last week, I finally saw a psychologist. I have been waiting for months. All I want is to get better and to have more healthy and stable relationships. I learned that iv had persistent depressive disorder with anxiety traits, and I also learned I have cluster personally, traitsconfusion. The cluster is not exactly a disorder, but just from my upbringing, something iv developed now I am just sort of waiting on support groups. And for my next appointment, I guess what I am looking for is some advice from people who have these and where to go from here. Iv always sort of struggled with relationships and stuff, have always felt a disconnect and have even done questionable things that I do not like. I am not a bad person and would never want anyone hurt in any way. And I really want to improve. Sometimes I react when hurt, and I have never liked that, not in any violent way, but just in stupid ways.

Support groups are usually wonderful, but maybe ask your psychologist to recommend a workbook.

Although I know almost nothing about you, I am willing to bet that things are not as bad as you think they are. Youre looking at things through depression glasses, which make everything look worse. When you recover, things will look very different. Problems that seemed hopeless will suddenly have obvious solutions. A lot of things can help standard treatments and the self help recommended by therapists. I have advice from experts in my comments, and you can click on my name and read. The most important thing is knowing how to cope in a moment of crisis. It very important to calm down. This will make you feel better, and let you think clearly, a very easy way to calm down is just to breathe slowly. Dialectical behavior therapy, which helps people who have bad, recommends this breathe gently, hand on your belly to feel it go in and out and breathe seconds in breath and seconds out breath till you feel ok. Simple distractions can help. The video below shows you distractions that can calm you down. Also, a safe hotline. No one will bother you if you call

If she is sensible and ladylike, you should be able to share your problem. But if she is into all fun and games, its better to talk to parents and therapy guy.

I have the same conundrum with my boyfriend. What I tell myself is that I will only ever let him know I am depressed if it benefits him. Ie if I am being a downer or acting strange, I will let him know. So he is not confused. I figured as much as I do not want my depression to affect him any. It is still more important that at least he knows what he is getting into and that my drastic mood swings are not his fault, most likely that is something that will never change about you. So it is good for her to know now so that she can decide if it is something she can handle

You should share your condition and feelings with her. She could be a good support system for you and will not take things as personally if she knew.

I doubt that you can keep this a secret from her. My advice is not to be dramatic about it. The truth can be told many ways. You might say something like, haven been myself lately or down in the dumps these days. Another problem with being dramatic about your condition is that it makes you feel worse about it. Don psych yourself out by telling yourself this is the worst depression of your life. I would definitely say that being around her makes it better. Friendship can be great therapy, but friends are friends, and therapists are therapists. A friend can help you take your mind off your problems for a while, and that is about it. A lot of things can help standard treatments and self help. Please click on my name and read

Title: Keep going out of spite.

The reason why I am still working hard for school is because I want to show the people who said that I will never graduate and become something that they where wrong I cannot live with the knowledge of them being right, so I will have to do whatever is needed and concentrate on school, even though all I want to do is sleep and do nothing at all. I feel like a failure for getting bad grades, which are not bad per se, but still not enough for me. Only a really satisfy me, but I still pick on the minor mistakes I made in haste. It makes me angry that people cheat in class and talk shit behind other backs. They only ask about shit they can gossip with and just drop their facade once they have enough of you. Now, all the teachers believe I am a good student, which bugs me, because this makes bad results even worse. And the I also have to think about the disappointment. This will probably not blow up in my face for the next years. I know I am wasting my potential, but no one cares. And if this is all everyone expects from me, then so be it. I will get my arse through

Today I was able to get out since my mom made me pay for my brother tuition fee balance. I went with my younger brother and dad even though im with them. Everything makes me anxious and really uncomfortable. Ive been sweating, but it feels cold it like the shiver or pain starts from your chest, then goes on until every part of your body is just uncomfortable. I think my mental health is affecting me physically now, and ive been trying to avoid or show it because my dad doesnt want any problems. Since my sister is already sick and were struggling financially. I still have tons of homeworks to work on tommorow, and my little break made me overthink more and become paranoid about everything. I just hope it wont get worse. What the least thing I can do is to cram my homework this weekend so I can get up from this piling problems. I miss the old me, but I know I all never be the same. I just cant accept it right now. But I hope someday I all do

This is my standard comment for people who are worried out their exams I do not know whether or not it is useful for that particular subject although it takes time to learn mediation there are simple things that are much like meditation that you can do right away one is grounding you can look up grounding methods and try a few these are very simple things examine objects, carefully count things, etc these are like mini meditations it actually mindfulness. There lots of good evidence for slow breathing it used for panic disorder and ptsd my best advice for stress when you are worrying you are not really thinking you re just spinning your wheels when you are calm you can think your way through a problem instead of just worrying about it think about the worst thing that can happen, how likely that is and what you could do if it happens in a stressful situation. Think about the different ways you can respond and decide which one is the most intelligent. Don make mountains out of molehills. One of the best things for stress is to develop good breathing habits. It very simple, although you might find it a bit hard to develop good habits a really simple but effective thing. The habit of responding to moments of stress by slowing your breath. The evidence showing that slow breathing is a fast and effective method of calming down is enormous. It used in treating anxiety depression and ptsd video the stanford ptsd studyconfusionSoldiers say that they are able to calm down immediately in dangerous situations by simply slowing down their breathing, rushing around when you do not have to. And doing things carelessly is bad for the nerves and makes for mistakes and accidents. Carefulness is a form of mindfulness. Slow movement is your friend. It prevents serious accidents, and your actual safety is good for your peace of mind. You can learn relaxing tai chi exercise from one or two beginners videos on youtube. Other things take some effort, but they are very rewarding things that make your life meaningful like a good hobby, art or volunteer work take care of your mental and physical health with the right lifestyle choices. This is one of the articles online with advice for therapeutic comfort. The best stress management is personal deal with things that are stressing you.

Hi, everyone. So I have add and hop and bad trip experiences in the past caused my brain to, in certain social situations, not see things them as they are. This has caused bad social anxiety because I kind of revive the bad trip in social situations. My therapist will prescribe milligram risperidone to take off the rough edges so I can expose myself in social situations again and relearn that it is fine. I am feeling good about this plan.

Recently I have been feeling. I cannot describe it. Let me try whenever I try to think of something that thought just will not come clearly like it used to. And if I try to know how I feel about that thought, I feel numb, as if I do not know what I feel about it. For example, I have been reading lord of the rings recently. I have read many things about it that it is good. The best trilogy, but I cannot tell whether I myself like it or not. Also star wars I kind of want to watch it, but I cannot tell if I like it. And also harry potter. I read harry potter during winter, and I can tell I loved it because I knew I loved it back then, but now I do not know what I feel about it. In summary, my mind feels clouded. I cannot think of anything clearly other than forcing myself to think of something which is strange. I do not know what is happening with me. This feeling is annoying. I want to know what I feel about things, but this will not let me please tell me what to do.

Lately, I have been fixated on someone and their life. They are famousconfusion. This happened before in the past with the same person, and it randomly resurfaced. It consumes my thoughts all day, no matter how hard I try to fight it, and it makes me anxious and sometimes depressed. The only relief I get is when I go to sleep. Its super frustrating, because I do not know what is going on and why it is happening. I have seen a therapist regarding this in the past, but she is not available until march. I have been super busy with work school and maintain a consistent workout routine, but I still cannot shake the thoughts. Does anyone have any effective coping mechanisms to distract myself and possibly get over

Title: I cannot focus, and it makes me sad frown, sad, angry or pouting.
Thread
I have struggled with this my entire life. I try my best to focus at a task use, pomodoro, change my diet, try, study with me. Streams do active study, mock tests, take supplements, get enough rest journal, all that I feel like I do not focus enough, unlike the rest of my peers, and it frustrates me so much. I start crying at night. I do not know what is wrong with me. I try so hard, but my mind turns into a fog. I cannot access a therapist because of my shitty family situation, and I am getting really concerned, because my exams and deadlines are coming up. I want to do better at my work, but I just keep blanking, and it makes me so sad. My parents have such high expectations for me, and I know I am going to get them down, like, always not to mention, I keep getting headaches and stay down because of all of this. And it is just frown, sad, angry or pouting. I do not know what is it I am at my wits end, I do not have good memory, grasp things slowly, and my brain fog does not make me feel better one bit, because I am in a ridiculously competitive environment. Everyone around me has something that I lack, and it is just skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant.

Title: His words I see no way out of this.
Thread
He temporarily lives in this metro area specifically macon, ga. Back in december, his roommates tore up his identity papers, and some id reported him that he was violent, even he was not that very paper was his only key getting out of that situation. Believe me, this has been reported to the police multiple times, but they did nothing. Now, his roommates moved out. He does not have utility, no job or no money, adding insult to the injury, no friend or family to call for help. I could not help him because I live currently outside of us. He refused to go back in homeless shelters because he was raped there multiple times in two different shelters. He wants to stay in a safe place until he get those papers back for months. He is severely depressed. Amp

Title: Going outside doesnt feel the same anymore.
Thread
Today I was able to get out since my mom made me pay for my brother tuition fee balance. I went with my younger brother and dad even though im with them. Everything makes me anxious and really uncomfortable. Ive been sweating, but it feels cold it like the shiver or pain starts from your chest, then goes on until every part of your body is just uncomfortable. I think my mental health is affecting me physically now, and ive been trying to avoid or show it because my dad doesnt want any problems. Since my sister is already sick and were struggling financially. I still have tons of homeworks to work on tommorow, and my little break made me overthink more and become paranoid about everything. I just hope it wont get worse. What the least thing I can do is to cram my homework this weekend so I can get up from this piling problems. I miss the old me, but I know I all never be the same. I just cant accept it right now. But I hope someday I all do

I just want someone to say that ill be fine tommorow. And then there is nothing I should be scared of. I will be safe. I feel like my friends are tired and annoyed of me. Im just really scared. I feel so cold. I want someone to assure me that ill be fine and safe. It feels like im handling all of my problems alone. I feels like I have no place in this world. They dont understand me. Everyone thinks of what they want to have. But what about me? I just want to feel safe. Im so drained, I want to get help, but I always have to hide. Im so scared

Two options call your therapist anyway, see your family physician instead, this sounds like a problem that is not going to go away without treatment and might get worse without treatment. Most therapists and psychiatrists are swamped from the pandemic. Your family physician should be able to help you until you can get in to see your therapist. Hopefully the two of them will work together.

Title: Im desperate for real.
Thread
Hi. I have years old, and when I started studying some psychology, I started to feel very similar to what a sociopath, or maybe some other type of disorder, can be before I did not know anything about it. But I remember having had some very wrong behaviors. As a child, I stole a lot. I always act without thinking about the consequences. Or rather, I always underestimate the consequences. I was a scammer. I lied. I even stole from my family. Now that I am aware of it, I only feel guilty when I am wrong with my family, but for no one else, only family. I feel emotions sometimes I cry only during some movies or songs, but I hate the real people. I am perfectly able to understand the emotions of others, but I do not feel anything personal anyway. I really like to deceive, and like it makes me feel superior to others. My social life is a very shit. Im the best alone guy in the world not have one friend. I cannot work because I hate, depending on others, I eat, I drink a lot of garbage. I go to bed late, I get up late. I feel like I am rotting away. Now I broke and I cannot afford a therapist. Every advice is appreciated. Thanks.
