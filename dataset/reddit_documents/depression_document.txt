Title: Motivated to change my life when I use weed.
Thread
Hi. Something is bothering me a lot. Why do I feel motivated to change my life when I smoke weed? I have smoked weed a little bit this month after coming home from work. I get high pretty easily because of my meds. The problem is that I get a boost of motivation to get my life together. I have been stuck in the loopholes of depression and adhd lately and stopped taking care or myself. When I am high, I want to change that. I want to be happy and better. Why cannot I feel like this when I am sober and able to do it? Anyone else went through this. Thanks.

Maybe the weed reduces the anxiety holding you back from feeling that way. Thats how it works for me pretty much and makes me really productive.

Title: I was in depression.
Thread
I am almost, and I just feel like venting a bit about my life. My first memories of loneliness were in the grade. When we moved to a new country, it was the first time I cried because I was alone. The grade was better, but I also started sorting out my feelings and working on myself. A year later, we moved back, and I really fucked up. I had hard time talking to people, and I did not know how to keep in touch. I started staying more at home, barely had any social interactions for an entire year. First time I cried uncontrollably deep into the night, and not a soul knew school was literally the only place I talked to other kids. So obviously I hated the summer break in retrospect, in the wheel started rolling, but in the it hit a field, mine and fucking exploded. I moved to a new class again social problemsconfusion, but all those problems stayed with me. People hated me, and I hated myself. I finally understood that I am depressed and genuinely always sad. When couid started, I was always by myself with my thoughts, and I could not even do sports to vent. It was not soon after that, I started cutting my wrists and pressing knives to my neck. I was getting rapid panic attacks and psychotic breaks to the point. I would wake up every morning in tears. I tried to return to poetry. But every time I sat down with myself, iGot suicidal after my bar mitzvah the year before I spent this birthday with no real friends, just me and a fucking cupcake. I tried to commit suicide around that time, but gladly, I didn. Luckily, the lockdown stopped during the summer, and I got to spend more time outside. I tried to avoid home as much as possible, but it could not last forever. I spent most of ninth grade on zoom classes, staring at faces I dreaded behind a computer screen. This whole year is kind of erased or repressed, but I know I was being very unstable and often suicidal. I moved on to tying nooses around my neck and going to bridges just to look out into the world that awaits me. I started getting pains in my chest that would last for hours as I laid on my bed thinking about how empty I am inside my family and my one friend. Far away, he was much of the reason I did not kill myselfconfusion became my only source of comfort after my class and society rejected me. I have written a lot of songs and short stories all derived from wanting a friend or someone to talk to in my life. My poetry helped me understand. I do have value in life, and that I should not wake up everyday, wanting to die, I fortunately found another friend going through similar shit. We helped each other grow, and for the first time in forever, I felt like the sun isFinally rising upon the cold sea of numbness, I was chained in. He inspired me to ask my parents, get professional help. It was a long journey from there, but I never looked back. It took a while until I opened up to them, but bit by bit, this whole life seemed less me. Finally opening up after years of loneliness and trauma is a challenge, and sometimes I still suffer the remnants of the diseases that haunted. But life is better. I wake up with a smile and I am not so alone anymore. I even allowed myself to love someone for the first time. Wow, you made it this far. Thank you. And I hope it helped you.

I am so happy for you. Getting out of all of this takes a lot of effort and patience and strength. I am glad you found refuge in poetry, which I have tried. I am a bit older than you, but I still have not come to terms with myself. I am proud that you have. I really wish you the best from the bottom of my heart, and hopefully this hell will not ever come back to you again. Purple heart.

Title: I will be alone forever.
Thread
I know it sounds dumb, but I know that without a doubt, I will leave this earth without ever having truly been loved. I feel like im spinning into a hole of darkness that I will never leave. I always put off relationships with people to focus on other aspects of my life, and now it is too late. I never wanted a partner because of my self doubt. And well, to be frank, I am not that attractive, and there is not much I can do about that. Sometimes people are just unattractive. I always thought that I had the rest of my life ahead of my to get in shape and maybe get a nose job to finally find someone who I could spend the rest of my life with. I was diagnosed with cancer at now, im, and there is no more hope left for my body. Every treatment that exists, we have tried and failed. My body is reduced to skin and bones from what used to be a young, healthy person. I am pale, and the life is draining from my eyes with every passing day. I was not conventionally attractive before, and all of this has made the situation so much worse, I crave the feeling of another persons touch, the warmth of their skin, the feeling of a keep it simple, stupid filled with love that ive never had. I have about months until im entirely bound to a bed, and maybe ill make it to see my andBirthday before my heart gives out on me. I do not know why im writing this. Maybe just so someone knows before I die, that my last few months were not filled with laughter and love and joy, but a sense of longing for a comfort that I will never have. I never had my first keep it simple, stupid or my first date. I have never had someone say they loved me or hold me close. I want to feel the embrace of someone just some one just once, but it is not like dying. People can exactly go on tinder. If anyone even sees this, please give your mom a hug for me. Keep it simple, stupid your partner, with every ounce of love you have for them and hold who ever you love, close to your heart. Sincerely, a dying soul, blue heart,

Title: Was told tonight that depression is not real and it is only sadness.
Thread
What a load of horseshit. Sure, as humans, we all naturally get sad from time to time. But depression is a whole nother ball game they will never understand because they have not been through it. I would much rather go through the normal sadness of, say, ink. A girl rejecting me after asking her out, boohoo, you get over it in a couple of days? Depression is constant despair, regret, guilt, hopelessness, a plethora of things that debilitate you. They do not understand.
Comments
I have been told to just do more sports and it will go away. Yeah, sure, just jog a bit and it will cure a mental illness. But then again, people who did not go through it will never understand unless they become depressed too. Most people lack the empathy and compassion to understand.

Probably weed calms you down and helps you to think more lucidly it helps you seeing the bigger picture with the same rationality that it is tampered by your anxiety. It is kind of what happens to me.

Title: And ready to.
Thread
First post I am gay and married. I have ruined my marriage by being self destructive and never really doing anything with my life. I have passions and hobbies, but they all seem moot if I cannot make money of them. So then I spiral. I am currently in the downstairs bedroom because my husband cannot stand to be around me, and I am afraid he is talking to other men, slowly becoming more and more detached from me. I fucked it all up. I cannot bring myself to do it yet, but I am afraid it is getting closer and closer

Just say it suicide. Trust me. Hiding from the word does not make it any easier to deal with that said if you are seriously considering something so final, why not just pack a bag and travel the world go do all of the things you have always wanted to do maybe spend a year finding ways to make money off your hobbies, even though you did not think it was possible if you still feel suicidal afterward, then that is a different story. But they way I saw it when I was ready to kill myself, was that by leaving a life I knew I hated, I was also giving up on all those lives. I never knew I could live also if you have not yet go tell your husband you love him and you are sorry right now, even if you do not mean it

Title: Can you get high on depression?
Thread
No, I have never done drugs in my life, but sometimes I feel that inflated, euphoric sense that people who have been high have described. I saw a post on askreddit today, and some of the stories people shared I remember feeling the same way or doing exactly the same thing. I know that my emotions are just chemical reactions in my brain. But my theory is, what if there is a chemical imbalance? Would that lead me to feeling a numb state of highness equivalent to drugs? But lesser, because sometimes I reach my stress breaking point, and I begin to laugh hysterically till I cannot breathe. I am hating myself, but at the same time, I cannot close my mouth or breathe in it. Some kind of involuntary laughter, or I make self depreciating jokes and laugh at them. I do not understand what is happening to me if anyone has ever had any experience like this, please tell me if I should be mildly concerned or to just ignore
Comments
I also used to randomly laugh when I was at my lowest, probably a coping strategy. If it is a mood shift, maybe see if you have any bipolar symptoms ink.

Title: Why do the good die young?

Sorry if this is the wrong sub to put. But I am a male, and it just seems like everything is getting taken from me and my life. My best friend, who was also only just died last friday, and it is killing me. I was so mad and angry. On feb the I lost my younger brother who was only a year younger. Amp that was probably the worst experience I had to make it worse. I was on vacation with my of and his sister. He was with me everyday. Amp one of the few people who visited me in the hospital countless times, as I have pancreas problems. Now, my other best friend, who wel call has passed, and I just do not know what to do anymore. I feel so sad and empty without them. They were so nice and genuine and actually cared about me. I just do not know what to do anymore, and the so called of cheated on me for the cherry on top. Why does everyone die so young frown, sad, angry or pouting. I am sorry for the rant. All I just need it off my chest and appreciate anyone who takes the time to reply. Thank to anyone who replies once again, frown, sad, angry or pouting downcast face with sweat.

Its good to rant sometimes I am so sorry for your losses and cannot imagine what it is like to go through as much as there might not seem to be a light at the end of the tunnel there is the sad truth to life is death but that does not mean we have to let it control our lives rather than letting your losses eat at you need to make them make you stronger follow your passions and live life in honor and in memory of your loved ones make them proud of you how can you make them proud if you give up keep fighting and never forget what grounds you I believe in you and know as long as you fight your fight they are proud

Its hard to deal with mental issues. As a man outside of a therapist, if you do not have people to support you, it really is just a man up and learn to deal with it. Unfortunately, you got to get rid of those toxic people and find somebody you can be open with.

Find the right people. I have spoken to, people who understand from experience as well as people who care enough to inform themselves that being said, those who cannot relate personally but go the extra mile to help are true friends you might not realize at first, but there will always be someone who is willing to help dont let your own or others. Pessimistic sides steer you away from the good in others and in life. Opening up to someone can be scary. But if they truly love you, it may just take longer for them to realize your pain dont shut people out because they do not understand right away.

I am a year old college student, and I just feel like I am wasting away. I do not do any of my assignments. I barely go to class. I cannot focus on anything. Anyways. I just stay in my room and rot alone. Why cannot I get rid of this? I do not want a career. I do not want to work hours a week for the rest of my life. It such a terrible thought and I know it is my future. Why would I ever want to embrace that? I just feel so devoid of hope. I am too young to feel like this. And it is been years. This is not fair. I have no motivation to do anything, I have no dreams or aspirations. I am just so apathetic I have so much existential dread, I feel robbed of my youth.

I feel exactly the same except I am and have changed majors twice. Some parts of it I know I would not mind doing for a job, but other parts make no sense, and I am dreading having to learn them. I am scared that if I get a job, I will just end up having to do those parts.

It has been hard these past two years. I have always known I had depression before it felt like my life has went downhill. I would not take care of myself by not eating or drinking, sleeping all day or not sleeping at all suicidal thoughts. And even a few times, when I was younger, acting upon that thought, I was starting to do better after I entered high school. My and year until my mother, who passed away from an overdose in may, she also had depression, was bipolar and suicidal afterward. It is like my life has been going doing hill and getting progressively worse, and I am honestly at my breaking point and have given up. I am lost and have nowhere to go.

We did not exchange anything for christmas or valentines for each other, and I am just feeling really sad because I always enjoyed stuff like that. My family lives a few hours away and has made it pretty clear they will help me with a divorce but not with help to move out or anything, and I am feeling very stuck. My husband has not been going to work, and I am afraid for the future. I do not love him anymore, and being around him constantly is making me very depressed. I have been looking everywhere for a job, but no one has openings for morning shifts. I just feel really deep in a hole that I cannot get out of. My only real option is taking medicine, and I am afraid I will be a very foggy version of myself, or likeEmotionless I have thought about therapy, but everyone has their own problems. I guess I just want to know if an anti depressant could improve my situation or if it is useless.

Of course it can no guarantees, since everyone responds differently and not all anti depressants are made the same. But being foggy and emotionless cannot possibly be worse, that a constant state of emotional desperation you re experiencing something awful. You owe it to yourself to get seen by a professional. You re not required to do therapy if you do not want. Just make sure you make it clear that you need a psychiatrist who can provide medications and not a therapist. Go get the help you need and get back to being your better self. You deserve a long and happy life. I wish you the best of luck. And I also admire your strength in reaching out

You ever read or hear about others. Opinion on people who are sad. Don be needy, be confident. Do not pity yourself. No one owes you anything. People do not really care, be happy, do not have a negative vibe, bring positive energy, do not be offended, it understandable and true on in a superficial sense. But damn if it does not make me want to avoid people, it quite clear I am a burden, and I should not be around people really just feels bad. I think the do not be bothered confident, learn to laugh at yourself is the most annoying, not because there it is never true. Sometimes it just feels if other are just allowed to say anything, make any judgement about me. However, I cannot think anything of it. I cannot lash out. Everything is just allowed. And than I have to have sympathy for their issues, too, I am just to jaded, honestly jaded, anxious, sad and tired

Title: Family making me feel bad for not caring about cousin with cancer
Thread
Ok, so I have been living with depression for years. I have used meds and therapy on and off. During this time. I am currently in the darkest spot I have been in for a long time regular suicidal ideation, personal hygiene slipping, losing focus at work, etc. I have told my family I am really struggling. I have told them about my illness throughout my life. They do not get it. When I tell them I am struggling, they go quiet and distant and do not make it easy to talk to them. I can handle it normally and just focus on myself and get myself through it. My cousin has just been diagnosed with cancer on the day after I told my family what a dark place I am in and how much I am struggling. The whole family is rallying around her, sending flowers, food parcels, etc. And I am being made to feel bad for not joining in and helping my cousin, and I fell out a long time ago and have not spoken for over a decade. It sad that she has cancer, but she is not an active person in my life. I barely have space to cope with my own health, but I feel like everyone is saying her cancer is worse than my depression and that no one cares about me. I do not know how much is true and how much is the depression? I do not know what to believe, but I have never felt soAlone in the world, and I do not know how to start making myself feel better. My therapist retired recently, and I have yet to find a new one that I connect with. I do not even really know what asking. I just feel so lost, so alone and guilty for not being able to feel bad for my cousin. I do not know how to stop feeling like this.
Comments
Personally, I dont know why you fell out with your cousin, but if I stop talking to somebody for years and there isnt much effort on their part to reconcile the relationship, then I wouldnt care if they were deaths door, because at that point you and all your issues are dead to me, just as the same is true. Where was her support for you only ever give what you get unless you have enough to be generous? In this case, I would leave it and just like how they allowed you to disappear from their life for years, they will disappear from yours forever. I have been in a similar situation. A relative was suffering with cancer at the same time. I was going through the worst period of my life at the end. I prioritized the most important thing, and that was not tending to an old lady with issues who already had one foot in the grave. It is sad to say it like that, but it is the truth. She died two years ago, and I mourned for her and did pay my respects. However, when people make you feel like your issues are not as big as theirs, a large amount of empathy and love is lost for that person. Do yourself a favour and make your own plan and stick to it. No matter what. Sometimes in cases like this, tough choices need to be made

They do not have to stress about me finding my chef knife, despite the fact that blades had never even been considered for self harm, or despite the fact that upon being discharged from the psychiatric hospital, I was praised for having recognized cooking as a healthy coping activity, or despite the fact that all I fucking want is some sliced tomatoes for my go sandwich. At the moment, I understand they worry about me going to my old apartment to the point of calling me every minutes after they made the mistake of letting me go to pick up some go clothes and my pa, I understand moving back in with my family is a benefit to everyone. They get to know I am in a safe place and I can focus on myself and save money. I understand that celebrating my homecoming is for them. They have not seen me in literal years. And a botched suicide attempt means they get me back. I get it. But damn if it is not demoralizing and dehumanizing. And damn if it does not just add to the regret that I had not followed through

But damn if it is not demoralizing and dehumanizing this cannot be overstated I had a similar experience calling confusion a long time ago now with so much more negative attention than positive from it I was so shocked by that it took me a while before I realized the overwhelming disgust I felt about that response of course we understand why people react like that but that does not make it right. To do it. Ink someone is got to give me a clue but those hotlines are they usually better than emergency numbers doesn really matter to me actually, in more recent years how do they expect me when I have a paranoid delusion and previous negative experiences to trust any of it? Eh the system is broke anyway, as all roads lead to prison hospitals, I kind of like, do not care if it is a nice voice on the other end of a phone call trying to talk it through anyway, not to mention I am not paying for another ambulance again.

I understand your struggle. I once gave my dad my gun because I didnt know if I could trust myself. A month later, I was ok and ready to get it back. They gave me the third degree and asked a million questions. Then after, like a week, they finally gave it back, but were constantly calling and texting, asking, where is the gun? Its in the fucking safe mom? But I know she was coming from a place of love and worry.

I cannot imagine how it feels to be treated like that, but I do know how your family might feel. I watched my sister hang herself from it off the ground when I was years old. I refused to be in the house with her alone for a long time after that because I thought she might try again. I have dealt with suicidal thoughts and attempts before, and I know that you are not constantly trying to kill or harm yourself. But after those few seconds when I truly thought my sister was dead, you realize you would do absolutely everything possible to keep them safe even if it means being obnoxious about it makes you feel worse. I am sure it makes you wish you would did it but know that the excessiveness comes from a place of love and desperation to keep you around. They will not act like this forever. Sometimes it takes a little while, but my sister got better. She is chopping up tomatoes for her sandwiches all the time without a second thought or word from anybody. Now, happy face or smiley I am so sorry you are feeling this way I hope I did not come off as condescending just wanted to offer some words I thought might help

Title: Wasting away.
Thread
I am a year old college student, and I just feel like I am wasting away. I do not do any of my assignments. I barely go to class. I cannot focus on anything. Anyways. I just stay in my room and rot alone. Why cannot I get rid of this? I do not want a career. I do not want to work hours a week for the rest of my life. It such a terrible thought and I know it is my future. Why would I ever want to embrace that? I just feel so devoid of hope. I am too young to feel like this. And it is been years. This is not fair. I have no motivation to do anything, I have no dreams or aspirations. I am just so apathetic I have so much existential dread, I feel robbed of my youth.

I am so sorry. The mental health system is extremely punitive and does not listen to what people need and treat them like people with agency its hard to navigate, and often people do not get the support they really need and end up saying what they need to say to get out of the hospital. I hope you can find support and community.

Im and I feel stuck with my life and have had depression for years, and I absolutely hate myself. Months ago, I got a job and I work hours on friday and saturday. Im in last year of highschool in swedenconfusion. And since I got my job, I have lost the last bit of hope and motivation with everything in my life that I still had sports, school, etc. So why dont I just quit my job? Well, it is difficult enough to get a job where I work and the potential for growth is very high. I work at a fancy bar resturauntconfusion, and the fact that my boss and other higher ups wants me to stay and advance to be a bartender, I have no social life. And the free time I do have, im just alone, being miserable with no one to talk to. I feel like I am a waste of a life, wasting my own life.

Hey, if your job is affecting your life, then leave it id if there is potential for growth, nothing absolutely nothing is more important that your mental health, youre you want a social life, you go have a social life. There is a lot of time for a job in the future. Go, do sports? Do school, do whatever makes you happy? If people ignore you, just fuck them, try to find something you like. Try finding new friends and try to enjoy your own company. I know it is easy to say all this, but I myself have been struggling with depression for years now, but all I can say is that having a job and advancing is not more important than your mental health. You like sports. You do sports. I know how depression can get. But if you like something, go! Do it. Trust me, it will be worth it more power to you.

Title: Daydream about suicide.

Often I will daydream about suicide. I love my children and my spouse, but sometimes the way my spouse withholds love makes me feel like killing myself. It may not be a huge deal to some people, but I feel like I do not want to live anymore when we are fighting, I cannot tell him anything, because he threatens to call the cops or my closest family members. I do not want to commit suicide, but I catch myself daydreaming about it. I know I have nightmares every night kids always wake me up when I am screaming or crying in the nightconfusion, and often times in the dream, I start committing suicide, slicing wrists, not usually the way I daydream about doing itconfusion. And then I frantically try to save myself is occasionally daydreaming about it. Normal. I feel inclined to commit suicide when I daydream about it and think that I will not actually do it. But it is a relief to think about ending it. These thoughts happen during low times our fights last, weeksconfusion, and we fight a few confusion times a year. What do you think? Am I just being a drama queen

Title: I am going to die in a week and I am excited.
Thread
I am a year old boy with parents who are constantly fighting, arguing, yelling, screaming, swarming, insulting and threatening me. I have never had a girlfriend. I have never had a single friend. I am failing school and have diagnosed bipolar, autism and adhd. One day next week, my entire family will go out for hours, and I will be left completely alone. So I will take the caliber pistol and take my own life, because it is the only option at this time to escape it all, because I cannot wait until I am. I cannot take it that long. I am very sorry if this is not allowed here, but I just really needed to tell someone, because I have been so socially isolated for years and will delete it if requested by mods. Thank you to this sub reddit and its members for bringing what little happiness and comfort I have experienced in my life if you are offended or angered by this post, just say, so, in the comments, I am used to being told, I am an idiot. I have really gotten this off my chest. Thank you.

I am a lot older than you. I have been there. I will not sugar coat anything. I feel the same way as I did at the world is in its infancy with understanding, feeling one does not belong. I know all about toxic name calling, insulting and threatening comments by those supposed to love you are only and are not anyone else, but yourself. I will not tell you all will be ok right away. I can only say you are not alone. You are in a situation you do not want to be in yet. You are in it. You reaching out proves you are not the same and will not be the same of being toxic. I just want you to know I really care. I mean, it. I know how you feel, and it is not because it is, I felt the same. I wish I could take the feeling out of the pit of your stomach and anxiety. You are not alone. I promise you that

Title: My girlfriend broke up two weeks ago I got a heart arrhythmia diagnosis one week ago today my eye doc found that I have worryingly high pressure in my eye which can mean blindness to easy treatment
Thread
Hi. I am I am alone. It funny. My life is isolation, alienation. My dad killed himself. My best friend lost himself in drugs. My first love had to go to her home country forever after three intense months together. And my current relationship finally fell apart because I had a panic attack after falling in love with someone who sees a similar darkness I do in the hospital. I found out my heart has a arrhythmia. Now it aches a bit. Some scans happened tuesday another talk I am a hypochondriac. You know, it awesome. No need to be scared of getting anything anymore. Now this eye shit, bro I am and perfectly healthy. Oh imagine calling from the hospital crying because you feel so isolated from a relationship that is otherwise perfect. You just both were so lost souls that you clinged too much onto each other so much the spark got lost with the independence. But she is my best friend, which is part of the problem. But also, fuck it, you know, fuck, I initiated the breaking up. She went through with it. But not really. We wait till the end of the month. But I do not see it. We ve been alienated for so long with me being scared of intimacy to a point that I do not desire her anymore. I cannot be in the moment. I am too alone for that. Now, this other girl is beautiful. I am poly, by the way. So this is not howYou think I cannot be monogamous or have these awesome, typical relationships? I died too many deaths, both through being passively suicidal and hypochondria. Well and close car accidents. My life lacks. Events, is empty, and yet so much shit happens. What the fuck I would love to see her every second day, but I can, she can. She depressed does not meet people apart from me once a week. And while commuting like thrice, a weekconfusion, which is ideal, you know? But I am fucked and fucking in love too. We did not confess anything. We just watch films, cook, listen to music, take walks, hold hands, we hold hands. Bruv what is this relationship? And why is it so fucking good and so fucking painful? The funny thing is, she could throw herself at me, and I would probably still be unhappily in love. And yet, after an evening of holding hands, I still am home the next day and wonder if this all bullshit, if it is gone in a heartbeat, just like everything that is dear to me keeps disappearing. How clich? And now this self indulgence, as if I am still a teen, fuck what this shit? Why should I not just stop contacting her and my girlfriend I am fucking exhaustive. My girlfriend keeps crying when we discuss us, because she never knows when anything I say is safe, like, if it is not a fluctuating thought that will change next week? Which happens so often it got less? IStopped telling her everything. When my impulses wanted to, it got better too little to late. I do not fucking know. One week, I feel like I exist, and this is fine. The other. The world is black and white, and all faces I see are empty. Even with the new girl, I am not constantly happy, and I do not even want sex with her that much too scared and too fucking alone. How did I get in this mess? Now, I am half convinced I am going to die in years. The last time I was this sure was when I was and had cancer in my mindconfusion. This is it feels like a regression. Only that this time it is from a diagnosis from me running around, having doctors hesitate at the results and ask sir, how long have not you been at a doctor? How fucking, very reassuring. I met this girl from the other continent and lost her july. I met my girlfriend september. I was in the hospital after a truck nearly blew my small ass car into oblivion due to me being distracted with my stress thoughts, basically driving into itconfusion, but thankfully, only crashed it a bit. And meconfusion, after whiplash and fucking being unsure if I die of internal bleeding for a few weeks, things were fine. I finished high school and finished the first draft of my second novel that I mind you started in because I wanted to write something that conveys my desperation toHave something of me before dying, even though I kind of knew I wouldn now this I am stable. You know, I write novels now and shower regularly, even brush teeth. I write novels, and whenever I finish one, I realize this is also not the one that will stop me or others from feeling alone. And this one neither just got to keep writing until I die. And I am really scared of dying. Everybody wants to go to heaven. And all that shit, only that I just cannot have faith only doubt the numbness, the alienation, the isolation I remember before couid I was clubbing lonely but clubbing now I have connections, and I lose them because there is not much and I cannot connect with strangers, and it is fucked. I am in a language school which is a waste of time, as it is economics oriented, and I fucking hate capitalism and will never do a job like that. I enjoy learning the language the of the timetable, the rest bro, my life is over soon in year, in, I fail to see the difference sometimes, and I cannot hang out with the one person I want, because our love life is a mess. I cannot keep it simple. Stupid. The one person I want because she is so depressed and in her own world just like me, and I fucking cannot hug the one person I loved first, because she is in fucking new zealand while I am stuck in germany.I do not want much. I just want an evening with this new girl the most realistic thing. And yet I can once a week is enough for her and I know if she would be down, I would go down the fucking same route as I did with my current partner cling onto each other until it all falls apart. No, I wouldn. I couldn fuck. Why is my robot my fucking life? All I want to do is to change the world, stop people from being alone and hateful or have a pure love. How does both seem equally impossible? But no, I have pure love. Fuck this overthinking fuck everything. But also fuck constant negativity and positivity, please how? What should I do everyday? I contemplate quitting school everyday. I realize there is no place where I be happy anyway, unless I suddenly get a successful author and can write and help. But that is something to pursue while doing things I want to get out of here. I want to get out of here. I have not left my country in years I need. But then I want to be with her and her. Fuck, not dropping out. No, I am top of the class, because it is targeted on peeps who finished tenth class. Not like me, the class. German shitconfusion you learn english? I do not need to learn english on their level. But french. I always wanted to learn french, but I also do not want anything. But aSmall club or caf where artists meet and laugh and sing so many modest and ambitious dreams yet so many impossibilities I remember as teen when I was just desperately numb. I do not miss it, but I fucking hate this. I fucking hate it. I fucking hate me. I fucking hate it. I fucking hate it. I fucking hate it. I dont want to be alone anymore. Fuck this all of this! Fuck it!

All you have written and how you feel seem so familiar to me right now.

But well, here is one human who read what you wrote, and there is some connection there. It might not be much, but it is something wishing you the best.

Title: Daydream about suicide.
Thread
Often I will daydream about suicide. I love my children and my spouse, but sometimes the way my spouse withholds love makes me feel like killing myself. It may not be a huge deal to some people, but I feel like I do not want to live anymore when we are fighting, I cannot tell him anything, because he threatens to call the cops or my closest family members. I do not want to commit suicide, but I catch myself daydreaming about it. I know I have nightmares every night kids always wake me up when I am screaming or crying in the nightconfusion, and often times in the dream, I start committing suicide, slicing wrists, not usually the way I daydream about doing itconfusion. And then I frantically try to save myself is occasionally daydreaming about it. Normal. I feel inclined to commit suicide when I daydream about it and think that I will not actually do it. But it is a relief to think about ending it. These thoughts happen during low times our fights last, weeksconfusion, and we fight a few confusion times a year. What do you think? Am I just being a drama queen

Worst part of life is coming to terms with things out of our control. I lost a close family member last year in a slow and agonizing fashion. Near her end, I could not bring myself to see her any more. I did not want to taint her memory. That decision has been my greatest test of judgement and guilt at the same time, life is cruel. But think about that kid that does not know anything of this. You can shield him from this. It. What parents were meant to do. I truly feel your pain even though they are not the same. Pain sucks one day when he is grown, this will be one of the most memorable conversations of his life.

Damn, this just broke my heart. It is so hard, having to deal with things so out of your control and unreachable. I am so sorry for your loss. I hope your reaching out to professionals for help, because there is only so much the internet can do. Please try and replace that horrible memory with all the positive ones, because the things that keep the spirit of the special people in your lifes that pass are the memories that you share together. Everyone says that time is the biggest healer, but I think that is bullshit. You are your biggest healer, your biggest support, your most loyal friend. You have the ability to still live such a fulfilled life and bring your kid up with that one loving parent that they need find your purpose, because when you do your life will change completely. You can get through this, and when you do eventually pull through it, you will never look back and start living your life with your family, as for your fianc. I am so sad to here. She was struggling, but I am sure she would not want to see you struggling like she did. Shes watching over you and your little family. When you look up in the sky at night, she is the brightest star in the sky. Youve got this star

I was happy, really fucking happy. I stopped doing drugs. I even stopped vaping. Everything was good for a whole year, but now I feel myself falling apart. I am drinking every night, just so feel okay. The alcohol is not working anymore, and I want drugs, but I am trying so hard stop myself. I cannot do it anymore. I just want to numb all the pain. I just want to be okay, but I feel like that is never going to happen. And if it does, then it will not last. I am to embarrassed to tell anybody or to even ask for help.

It is her prized possession. And now everyone looks at me with disgust as if I hit myself. The other driver that hit me should have just killed me few inches below my ear, and that piece of glass in my head should have just cut my throat end my life so that her family will not be disappointed in my girl, and she can continue to live comfortably. I do not remember if I ate or drank. I hate my face. I am ugly with these scars on my head, and these stitches make me look like frankenstein. I hate myself and I hate my life. I hate that. I have to expirence all of this when I could be feet deep. What is my purpose I used to provide and take care of my girlfriend? And she never had to worry about much.

I am sorry you are suffering this way. Fbi is truly devastating, but know that the brain is amazing and can recover. You re at the beginning of a journey that may very well improve.

Hello, everyone I am coming on here because I need some advice. My boyfriend and I are looking for a male therapist to help him with a few things. His main focuses are depression, self esteem issues, anger and failure management. I was wondering if anyone on this app can recommend a therapist to me either someone they or a friend have had a positive experience with in the past he was a little hesitant on the therapy idea, so I am looking for someone chill who can help guide him to his best self happy face or smiley thanks so much.

Why does it need to be a male therapist? And therapists vary from place to place so you cannot really get recommendations. And even then a therapist that works for some people will not work for others. Therapy is trial and error. You have to keep trying until you find the right one. Nobody can tell you a good therapist for a person except for that person.

Title: How did you get over the depression of nothing is worth the effort of doing, giving up easily.
Thread
For anyone depressed who is managed to work past it job applications, interviews as soon as any effort is required, I just give up. I think, what is the point? But then I get depressed in myself for giving up easily and not even trying and being useless. In that aspect, I hate having to prove myself or my worth to others. It feels degrading, and the thought of it makes my anxious, withdrawn and depressed. I want to crawl into a hole than attend an interview. I hate that feeling of interrogation. I cannot handle the pressure and nerves. It causes also things like keeping a healthy sleep cycle. I lack any self discipline, it holding me back. I want to have a normal and successful productive life, but my depression gets in the way I want to be. Someone who wakes up at a normal time does normal things works hard for things they want does not throw in the towel as soon as they feel anxious. It not laziness, but because my depression causes it. I want to hear how anyone may have gotten out of this rut to normality

Perhaps try to reward yourself now, before you do anything, you only have the intention to try toconfusion, do anything, but you are going to reward yourself now, already, then, if you did that thing, you reward yourself again.

And if I could fall asleep and wake up in a dream, then I would be okay never spending a day seeing the sun and if I could close my eyes to never open them again, I would be grateful just for the chance to give this story a timely end oh and dont spend your tears cause I wasted my years there was joy I knew but my time was due so do not think that my heart was not true learn to let go. That is all that I know cause when I fall asleep and awake in a dream, I do not worry about the world I left behind. I do not regret my life just cause it had an end thats like regretting a love cause they stopped being your friend. The memories are worth it the days I spent joyful when they were. But every single story has its very last page, and mine is right there too. So if I close my eyes and go to sleep, keep in your sorrows and do not think to weep, cause I have just moved on to a world with no shame. I closed this painful chapter and I hope you do the same

Some good motivational videos, like, if he did not start now to try to attain happiness, he will be stuck in a cycle of negativity and toxicity, but he dismisses me, duh! You cannot pull me out of my depression, you have to join me. Being depressed is a vulnerable state, and you kind of need to listen more than talk. If you want to dig at it. If someone showed me a motivational video, I would probably feel like I am more of a failure at most light encouragement. But it is much nicer when the person is just listening and not really passing judgment about where they think I should be or what they think I should do

So someone I knew online wanted to cut ties with his family because of being neglected and treated like shit there. But at the same time, is too depressed and unmotivated to go get a job and live alone. I gave him some advice and showed him some good motivational videos, like, if he did not start now to try to attain happiness, he will be stuck in a cycle of negativity and toxicity. But he dismisses me, duh sorry if I am somehow being somewhat insensitive or naive, but I genuinely want to help him. What should I do to help him?

You should ask your friend if he wants to talk to you about what is going on in more detail. The only thing is do not try to end the conversation with tips or techniques on what he should do. Don even have a conversation. Just sit there and listen and really listen, but do not share. Give him the full floor to really speak his mind and feel like someone can hear him. One of the hardest parts about dealing with depression is feeling like you are battling it on your own, because as it may seem, a lot of people say they want to help, but there is something about just slapping a bumper sticker clich on a person experience like it gets better, or just one day at a time, and shit like that, this completely undermines the human experience. I do not think people really give each other enough time or space to truly flesh out and express their point of view. When you let someone tell you what is going on in their head with no intersections or distractions, I think you can really connect with them far beyond what you thought capable. And you both might just learn something, just a suggestion

Title: I should be put down.
Thread
I am a year old, worthless human that should be put down. I fail at all my college courses and about to be suspended from my university. I fail at the simplest assignments and quizzes. I ca not handle any amount of responsibility. I am always scared and want to hide from the world I am a terrible person to be around. I believe I am a malfunctioning human that should be shut down for my own good. Seeing myself like this is painful. Living with no income is difficult. I can nit stand seeing myself go any lower, and I feel I must end it. Now, before it gets worse, I will be suspended by the end of this semester.

I dropped out after my first year after my grades plunged, just stopped showing up at some, took some time but I eventually went back and finished and that was a long process as I had to retake like classes that I failed sometimes taking a break from school helps a lot. Dont worry about finishing right away not everyone is done in years also, maybe you do not finish school and that is okay too not everyone has to go to school youre and you have got lots of time.

Title: Living with parents that constantly buy junk food.
Thread
So my parents like to buy nothing but unhealthy junk food like chips, cakes, ice cream, you name it all over the house. Its in the pantry fridge stacked all up on the counters, etc. She is skinny fit, and my dad and brother are overweight, and its obvious she is only buying it for us, even though we all tell her not to like she is doing it on purpose. And whenever I go through a depression episode, I binge eat like crazy, and I gained pounds. Since november. I tried telling my mom to limit down on buying it, and she says, its my fault for not controlling myself. I feel disgusting whenever I look in the mirror and I wish I could honestly just die. I am to the point where I am just going to lock myself in my bedroom forever and starve myself so that ill stop constantly eating
Comments
I get what you are going through. My mom is the complete same when I lived with her. She would only buy junk. I know for a fact she did it on purpose. She would call me fat and all that yet only busy, greasy shit. I think she did it so I could be fatter than her. This led me to having an ed. It is a nightmare with all the mental shit I deal with. My best advice would be to try to have three meals a day and when you get a depressive episode, leave the house so you cannot binge if you can buy your own healthy foods, be aware of yourself and not too strict. So you do not develop an ed. Best of luck to you.

It a very dangerous road to go down advice. Don be ashamed of these thoughts. It should go without saying that it might not be the right choice, but do not ever feel like you should be ashamed. Don compare yourself to others suffering, wish I could be encouraging, but I am dealing with the same thoughts.

If you really need help and cannot get professional help, the next best thing to do is watch youtube videos on how to help youself with suicidal thoughts. Many videos on there will give you something new to think about and try just know having intrusive thoughts can be typical and considered as suicidal ideation, but acting it out or attempting is a whole new level and taken seriously.

Try to create a stronger voice to tell yourself that your life is valuable and you are wanted. Strengthen that voice so that it becomes your main voice.

Title: Sick and tired of all the bullshit cure suggestions.
Thread
I am fucking sick and tired of all the bullshit suggestions people make about getting better. No, exercise and a better diet will not, magically make my brain function properly. Yes, I have tried medication, it did nothing. Yes, I have tried. Tis it did nothing. No, I have not tried therapy. But therapists have literally refused to treat me because of my autism and communication disorder. Fuck this shit. Every day, I get closer and closer to ending it. I just want to enjoy life. But none of this bullshit works.
Comments
You re right. The fixes are very dependent on the person I am, an advocate of exercise and diet as it helped me. But when you are struggling with depression, a lot of people do not understand how impossible that is. While I am not over it, I do have some days that are not as bad anymore. The thing that helps me is focusing on sounds. I know it sounds stupid, but bear with me next time you click your seatbelt or are cutting up food or are flicking a light switch, pay attention to the sound it makes really focus on nothing but that action. I do not think there is any one fix but a lot of little things that accumulate and get you through your day. This was one of those things for me. It let me slow down. And for whatever reason, it brought me joy in a time where there was none good luck, friend, happy face or smiley

God, damn! I feel this. I have been in therapy on and off for about a decade. I feel like once they have tried cut and schema therapy, they are really all out of options, huh? Theyll just be like, try harder. No, get me a different treatment plan. The amount of times professionals have told me to use a planner and stick to it, write it down, excercise and eat better literally hundreds of times at this point, and I am not expecting them to stop now.

I know how ignorant this sounds, and you probably will not like this, but I would suggest a small club like activity that takes hours of your day. If you enjoy it, you will wait and be hyped for it the entire day, which will give you the courage to add more things to your schedule, like other activities such as that, or maybe just go outs with friends that you ve made there. I mean, I can guarantee that you will like it, that why you have to pick it yourself, anything that you can compromise with your depression to go there

I have relapsed again, and my schedule is pretty similar. The only reason I left the house in, like two weeks, was to get cat food, otherwise I sleep all day and try to avoid reality. My bed does not have any sheets. I take a bath, at least, but brushing my teeth is still hard. For some reason, I do not want to see my family or talk to anyone. The difference is, I have work, and I am afraid of the consequences of not having shown up. I alternate between getting anxiety from the thought of getting fired and wishing they would fire me. One of my family members is having a birthday party, but I do not want to go. I do not want to do anything. It sucks, because a month ago, the meds were working great, but they have worn off again. I was supposed to see my counselor this month, but they cancelled it for some reason, and now I am stuck, and it is really hard to get out. Its like, no matter how, I try to have a semblance of a normal life, I always relapse back to this hole. I feel like I will always be a useless person. Consistency is so damn hard

I do something very similar. I get an allowance and I study from home, but the workload is not that hectic. So I might do hours of studying and then literally do nothing. Stay in bed or sleep. Its pretty miserable.

Hey, there. Sorry to hear you are not doing so good. I can relate to how you are feeling. I had to stop work due to an injury. So I have spent basically the last months in the same loop you find yourself in. Do you live near any national parks or places you could go camping? Not sure if you like the outdoors. But I took myself camping alone for my birthday last year, because I did not want to spend it at home doing the same thing I normally do. The whole process of planning the trip. And making a list of things to take was really enjoyable. Plus, I picked a place that was about a five hour drive away so I could have a long road trip listening to music and seeing new places. I will admit that I still felt a bit low, but it was refreshing to be outdoors and to do something entirely for myself, and I would do it again in a heartbeat. If outdoors is not your thing, do you like to do anything creative writing, music, poetry, drawing, sewing, woodworking, or perhaps something more technical, like small electronic projects, making yourself a speaker to listen to your music confusion? If money is no issue, maybe you could invest in some little diy starter kits of things. You might like to try out a paint set and some canvases, maybe a sketch book and some nice pencils, or go and buy some tools and make something toDisplay in your apartment even if you try it out and it is not for you it might bring you closer to a new passion or point you in a different direction I know it can also be super difficult to find the motivation to do any of the above when you are deep in a depression so if you can find the courage to seek out a doctor I would definitely recommend talking to one about a referral for a psychologist and or starting some medication I have just started taking meds again because I found myself in a very low place and while I might not feel I can definitively say that I am better than I was before on a bit of a side note it could be fruitful to look into whether you display symptoms of adhd because the lack of motivation is a big thing that not a lot of people realise can be a big indicator. Look into executive dysfunctionconfusion depression and anxiety can be co morbidities of adhd and I am in the process of getting an assessment for it myself after years of depression, a lifetime of anxiety and several medications that did not work. If none of that is helpful, you could get yourself a pet. That way you have something to focus on that is not yourself and the worries in your mind and in return you get a cute little creature that loves you for existing hope this can help you find a little happinessIn every day.

Nah, bro, jealousy of that kind is natural. She should not be putting you through that, and you two should talk about that and how it makes you uncomfortable. If she cannot respect that, then the decision of whether you will stick around and just take it on the chin for the sake of her is entirely up to you.

I tried zoloft, but it was a really bad one for me. I still have not found my pill that works properly yet, but it might work for you. How many have you tried? Have they all been serotonin based? Maybe you could talk to your doctor about a dopamine based medication. That is what my doctor is trying for me now.

Doing nothing only feeds the cycle even if you feel no desire to do anything or might not feel enjoyment doing things you will feel better after doing something I feel the same way and I am very unmotivated but I would rather leave my place and do something even if I do not have a good time than stay at home like every other day if you can find something you enjoy or happiness entertainment accomplishment, do those things do not tell yourself you will not enjoy them instead, try to figure out how to enjoy them

God I feel this so hard I work days a week which mostly handles rent and stuff and the rest I cover with savings but all I do with the rest of my time is just lay in bed I sleep which is not going well eitherconfusion until I can bear myself to get out of bed in the afternoon to shower at one point smoking weed made me feel better enough that I could get through showering without much complaint but now it does not help much and the whole thing is just excruciating all I want to do is lay down I do not want to do anything but I want so bad to want to do things. Life is like walking through mud

Hi, you may want to try an antidepressant depressed patients typically benefit from them it does not hurt and after a few months if it is not helping then you slowly stop taking it you should not be this depressed and psychiatrists can help you start to feel better sorry you are feeling this way medication is there for a reason and works for many people.

Sorry, this is tough. Are you on meds? Sounds like your circadian rhythms are out of whack, get a massage, a dog, and hire a physical trainer. Half joking here, have you had a an overnight sleep study? You need to understand more about the amount of deep sleep you are getting.

If you want an adrenaline rush, try an ice bath, see if you have any wim of seminars in your area, they are just day. Dude is amazing and dealt with overwhelming grief and depression. Using ice baths, his wife committed suicide, leaving him with kids to raise.

I do not know if it is the state of the world in or if im just lazy, but that is how my days look ever since I graduated high school, I am about to turn this year and im in college, but it is not on campus yet. I have been living like im still for the past years, and it just makes me feel like absolute garbage. When I see people my age going out and having fun and actually letting their life take off, I do not know what my passion is, and I have nothing that makes me want to wake up every day. This couid aftermath shit is brutal.

Personal training can help or exercise in general, it are not perfect, but I would work out alone in my apartment at because of bad brain chemistry. Eventually, I would swim days a week cause I found the water relaxing. Small steps. Your body has endorphins and working your muscles makes that stingy bastard. Release those happy chemicals. Most of all, you did good. Talking about it. Think about what you like however small plants, art writing, singing anything, take it slow. Take it steady.

My girlfriend often shares me about how she find someone very much attractive. We are in a long distance relationship, so I dont get to hangout with her.

She said to me he that was so handsome, tall and nice posture. Every time she goes there, she use to look for the guys. And later then, when they came out, they were really excited to talk to him gossiping about him that go talk to her. It really makes me jealous, and I dont know how to react

It will get better. You mean, I will not be working almost all of my waking hours to stay alive and healthy, and I will not be tired all the time. Well, of course you have to keep working. Fuck off the lot of you. My conditions are never going to improve. The hope is that I become so numb that I stop bitching about it.

I wish I was dead often, too. Nothing helps either. I have been told to think of what is worth living for, but I literally hate every aspect of my life. I seriously cant get better.

Mate. I feel you have pretentious people being like, dont kill yourself. You have so much to live for. Think about youe loved ones and the like it actually ridiculous. These people want to appear like they are helping, but they are not doing jack shit the people preaching? What the they going to do you going to help change my life? What you going to give me a million dollars? You going to buy me a house? You going to be my friend and visit me, talk to me and in general, put up with my shit for the rest of my life, or at least til whenever necessary to ensure I am okay and happy. Nah, did not think so mate, but that is humans. For you, full of shit. People want to say it is your life, but turn around and contradict themselves. Cus it does not fit their ideologies. The thing is, it is your life, and one should have full autonomy of what they want to do with it. I am not encouraging suicide, per se. But what I am saying is that if someone is suffering to the point, they truly see no point of existing, then they should have full autonomy over what they want to do with their life. People die everyday. The world keeps spinning. People will never truly understand your trauma. And the pain you have been through your life truly is unique only to you. Some people are just privileged and audacious with that beingSaid, what do you mean you have been waiting years. Have you been trying your best to make a change? Your username is ridiculous, by the way, face with tears of joy.

May I ask what have you been waiting for years? What have you done about it? Can you do anything about it? Why I am in a fucked up period for some time now as well. I hate almost everything about my life. Atm, everyone around me is getting sick, including me. I cant get a normal job, and even when I try and educate myself to get a better job, it just isnt happening. Its been years today to be exactconfusion. I will be in june, and I have nothing in my life that I could call it mine or say, this is my house. I have been in depression with full on anxiety since I can remember, and only now have I started to think maybe there is more to it. There have been times where I thought about just ending it all. But then again, I couldnt. I couldnt just leave, not knowing what awaits me as stupid as that, my sound im just interested to see if it really gets better. Maybe thats why im still here. Or maybe, because even tho, I am really a miserable grump. I am around a lot of positive people, and I see them happy and think, maybe one day I will be too. We will die anyway. Why not just see what happens until then? You never know? I dont know. Im just ranting, empty

Yeah its true that people dont really recognize mental health in the right spot light but please understand that you are special and the demons dont want you to recognize that you have to start controlling your thoughts you are always in control but those demons want to make you think you arent so they can take control its up to you if you want to get better seems kind of harsh but its the truth talk to someone you love or a therapist I dont know ur full situation but I can say for a fact someone does truly care for you and they arent trying to sound selfish by telling you to live for them its hard to stay positive especially of what you and the world is going through but its up to you if you want to continue to suffer or not, it will be hard and scary but with the right effort and self positivity, you can learn to be happy hope this helps

Yea life sucks. I do not know why it is this long. Its painful every second takes so much spite to get through. I have autism due to not understanding some social things. I have made some people really angry in the past, so I do not have much emotional support either. Became somewhat numb recently, its just been so difficult to talk. My apologies if this is too wordy.

Oh my gosh! Ike I told my mom months ago and how I was feeling just intrusive thoughtsconfusion. And she was like, you need to pray, you know, months ago, I was mad at everyone for not doing anything. But then I prayed, and it was god who changed me. I was the problem. Not anyone else I like, yeah, praying works on some people. But at this point, I do not even talk about anything anymore to my parents. My mom also said, I have symmetry, ocd. And I told her about itconfusion. You know, when I took psychology in college, I thought I had every disorder. I think everyone has a little bit of everything in them. She does not freaking realise the severity of it. When I first told her when it wasnt as bad, she brushed it off be it was not completely interfering with my life. Now, when it is, she says that I looking too much into disorders when I ve been dealing with this since the red grade

I am so sick of people saying it gets better it didntconfusion because at this point I am sick of waiting for it to get better only to be met with disappointment they say make it through the week then the week comes then next week it is make it through the week again but that is not living that is baring through an existence you both know is miserable. I never asked to be born so why should not? I have my death within my own will I have been living my life for others and to ask someone who is miserable to keep living for other peoples sake is selfish as hell. Youre literally asking someone to suffer at the expense of others, which is the definition of selfish. And on another note, why do we keep saying it gets better while simultaneously telling young people, especially teenagersconfusion you think life is tough now just wait until you are. So which is it? Does it get better or does not it? Because judging by life, the state of the world and the fact that I have been waiting six years, it does not seem like it does fuck the world. I should have blasted myself at

I think part of it has to do with having nothing to live for, try to find something perhaps even if it is selfish. As long as it is not destructive, it will not cure depression, but it would make it slightly more bearable.

Yeah, life only seems to keep getting worse for me.

Title: I keep crying when someone is kind to me.
Thread
For the past few weeks every time someone is kind to me or is caring, I can barely fight the urge to break down crying sometimes I cannot fight it at all. It not even huge acts of kindness a friend said she would skip work to hang out with me and I cried. Another person said, I am important and I cried. My partner hugged me tight and guess what? I cried I do not even feel anything. I just tear up uncontrollably and feel so broken after

I have this as well no idea what it is I guess I just feel relieved I am actually being seen but it is not like happy tears it is very much still sad lol.

Title: I fucked up and left the house key in the door of my shared apartment.
Thread
My housemate would not stop pressing them about it. I was so embarrassed and angry at myself. I ruined my impression on these people. I stay in my room all the time and never talk to anyone. Never come downstairs, eat alone in my room. I just want them to leave me alone. When I went to my room, I started hurting myself. I was so angry that I fucked up like that. I keep messing up. I keep being irresponsible, and I am getting really mad at myself. I am in such a difficult time, and my mind is not working properly anymore. I just kept screaming in my head, what is wrong with you? What is wrong with you? Stupid idiot.

I left my apartment door wide open while walking my dog yesterday. I have also locked my keys in my apartment and once lost the guest key for a friend I was staying with. Shit happens. Life goes on. Just work on preventing it from happening again. You could put your keys on a lanyard around your neck or wrist and keep them there til the door is locked. That way, there is no way you can forget them.

Title: Those telltale signs.
Thread
I know I am having an episode when my hair gets matted and I only drink out of old soda bottles. My floor is covered in clothes and I only eat premade food. I know it when I stop checking my blindspot while driving and avoid shaving my legs. I know it when I skip every song on my playlist and I do not feel like singing my favourite songs.
Comments
I get the same way I do not bother getting drinks that I enjoy just water with no ice I am physically hungry but no desire to eat or cook I do however check my blindspot since I am scared of ending up disabled when I am in a funk like that I do not even put on music maybe just talk radio to have some background noise to drown out my thoughts a bit I have no advice other than maybe force yourself to wash your hair and clean your room I know when im depressed and have not showered in a few days I always feel better when I do then I get enough energy to clean the house a bit which is good because clutter triggers my anxiety

Title: I often wonder what it would feel like to just be normal.
Thread
Or at least what I felt like before when I was a kid and somewhat normal although tbe I think I have always been sad at least since the age of just now it is manifested into depression I just want to feel normal not sad all the time and when I am sad I want it to be normal sadness not depression
Comments
I so feel you on this lately I have begun accepting that in some aspects I will not ever be normal. I have heavily traumatised. My battles are what most people out there do daily with ease. My battles are what is making me the greatest fighter I have ever known my battles of handling myself and my life with all, its difficulty makes me appreciate myself and realise everyone goes through different things in life. I never chose this family to be abused for so many years, but it does not matter anymore. It gave me tools to achieve my goals in life, helping others. I can relate to so many people out there because I am not normal. And honestly, I do not care. I am not. I am who I am and I am happy with myself. I have flaws and I improve daily for maybe years straight. Now, I will not ever stop until I get my goals done. I will not stop until death stops me. Why do you tell me all that it is so irrelevant to my post, so that hopefully, I will encourage you to look at yourself and love yourself. You re imperfect, and so am I and everyone else. And that is the beauty of being human. I am sure you will be able to write such things about yourself. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday not to who someone else is today. They re not you. They have not seen what you did. TheyHave not thoughts, your thoughts, ways, behaviour. Only this week did I finally realise all I am writing here. It took me years to understand that.

This is something I do not ever really talk about with anyone or ever something I have ever admitted to myself. But I really need to write this down and share with someone even if it is anonymously. English is my second language, and I do not ever really use reddit, so please bare with me if I seem off tracked ever since I was a kid, I have always been self aware of not being the prettiest of girls. I struggled with my weight from early on as well and strongly felt like I was treated differently by everyone in my life because of it teachers, other kids and sometimes even my family played a big part in my self hatred that I seemed to start developing from the age of. I remember several points in my childhood idly, where I felt genuine hatred toward myself and my body in a time when I do not think I should have been so aware of things like body image. One of those times was when I was coming back from the pool and my brother who was at the time, and I was or made fun of me because I had little stretch marks on my belly, saying that my body was like that of a mom who had kids. I remember going into my room and pinching the sides of my stomach hard until I cried. I ended up faking that I was sick that night and skipped meals for two days because of it.There was another time I remember feeling horrible shame and self pity when over hearing two adults in my family talk about me while I played video games in the living room one said I was getting too big for my age and the other said I would stop eating when I started noticing all the clothes I like will not fit me anymore the thing is that it was true I remember going to a store once with my mother and having a lady that worked there say I could not try out the kid sizes because il stretch the fabric and to try the women section the amount of humiliation I felt was something that to this day I feel in my bones I cried so much in the dressing room hearing her say that on my way back home all the way back to my room it was no different at school one last sob story il share was when I was walking home from school two girls were sitting on a bench chatting and when I passed by they quiet down and started laughing I had headphones on so they did not know I could hear them honestly I do not think they cared either wayconfusion and one said to the other I would kill myself if I looked like her with what I can only describe was literal disgust in every word I was severely bullied most of my time there because of my weight and looks the only supportive andLoving figure in my life was my mother, who passed away when I turned. I think this is when I started to completely close myself off and become isolated from middle school all the way to high school, I probably only made one or two friends. Kids are cruel, and sadly, I grew up going to some awful schools where the kids would not even want to sit next to me because I was the ugly, fat girl. Luckily, I met my best friend during this time, who I am still very much good friends with. He struggled with bullying himself, so we sort of bonded for being two little outcasts. It was probably the best thing that could have happened to me in that time, because I was a very lonely kid when I was in my teens. I always thought that when I got older, things would get better, that people would not be as cruel and I would not be judged so much by appearance, like how I was in school. But I realized as I started college, and time went by that it did not really get better. I was still treated differently by everyone around me. I would attempt to include myself in groups or try and reach out to others, but would always be disregarded or not acknowledged. Its something I cannot really explain and believe you would have to experience it first had to understand the feeling of rejection. The friend I talked about before as he got olderHe really flourished and became a very outgoing young man he would always try and include me with his group of friends when they made plans to go out I tried everything in the book to seem friendly to others and likable, but for some reason people always seemed to steer away from me again. This is a feeling you really had to have felt first hand to know what I am talking about when you are self conscious and over analyze as much as I do you start to notice and pick up on everything around you. They would reluctantly include me in pictures and when they did, I would later see on social media that I was cropped out whenever I would pitch in or say something I would be talked over or ignored. If we were in a group they would separate from me or turn to talk to someone else. My friend never left my side, though, and I was grateful, but always felt like he did it because he felt responsible for me being comfortable. And that made me feel like I was hindering him from having a good time with his friends. Regardless, he would always invite me, and I eventually stopped accepting. As I got older. I never got romantic advances. No one ever asked me out in college. I was never approached by a guy or asked out on a date. I was too ashamed and painfully shy to do so myself. So I never to this dayEver had a real boyfriend or anything close to it. Despite my weight, I always keep myself presentable. I have good hygiene, wear nice clothes, learned to do my make up. But even then, it is never been enough to even so much as get asked for my number. The dates that I have been on were embarrassing. Tinder dates that never went into a second date because the people were more so into my weight than me as a person, the only time where I have ever been attracting to someone was because they fetishized my weight, and that just made me feel worse about myself. Its gone to the point where I have lied to friends and family about having a boyfriend, so they would stop feeling sorry for me. I am years old now, and fear, things are not going to get better. All of my good friends I have pretty much met online. I struggle with body image to this day and live with constant self hatred. When I am spiraling, it is difficult to even look at myself in the mirror, as dramatic as that may sound, I am afraid this is how it is going to be for the rest of my life that I will not be able to start a family or live a full life, because I have caught myself in a vicious cycle that I do not feel myself strong enough to escape from that. As quickly as these years have passed, another will come whereI have never felt love for myself or acceptance. I am afraid I will not ever know what it is like to be called beautiful by someone who really means it. Sorry. If this sounds more like a sob story than a confession, but it is something I really needed to get off my chest this morning. As I feel really low about myself, pray for me.

Your story is really touching, and I can relate to so much of it. The feeling of being an outsider and wanting to fit in is completely familiar to me. I had really bad social anxiety and low self esteem. I worried about my looks a lot. You said, you never talk about this. Do you think you could try to talk to a therapist or somebody? It might help you a bit. Maybe it is worth a try. You may need to try a few and find one you feel comfortable talking to. Your. English is great. English is my first language, and I would not have known that it is not yours if you had not said anything. Actually, english is my only language because I am a dumb american laughing out loud. It not really funny, thoughconfusion. I wish I was bilingual like you. I will keep you in my thoughts

Honestly, you got to learn to use paragraphs I skimmed, and heres the thing women have it much easier than men in dating. So if you are in shape, feminine and friendly, you should not have much issues attracting men, find a weightless plan and stick to it. This will give you the best opportunities as a woman.

I never got romantic advances. No one ever asked me out in college. I was never approached by a guy or asked out on a date. I was too ashamed and painfully shy to do so myself. So I never to this dayEver had a real boyfriend or anything close to it. Despite my weight, I always keep myself presentable. I have good hygiene, wear nice clothes, learned to do my make up. But even then, it is never been enough to even so much as get asked for my number. The dates that I have been on were embarrassing. Tinder dates that never went into a second date because the people were more so into my weight than me as a person, the only time where I have ever been attracting to someone was because they fetishized my weight, and that just made me feel worse about myself. Its gone to the point where I have lied to friends and family about having a boyfriend, so they would stop feeling sorry for me. I am years old now, and fear, things are not going to get better. All of my good friends I have pretty much met online. I struggle with body image to this day and live with constant self hatred. When I am spiraling, it is difficult to even look at myself in the mirror, as dramatic as that may sound, I am afraid this is how it is going to be for the rest of my life that I will not be able to start a family or live a full life, because I have caught myself in a vicious cycle that I do not feel myself strong enough to escape from that. As quickly as these years have passed, another will come whereI have never felt love for myself or acceptance. I am afraid I will not ever know what it is like to be called beautiful by someone who really means it. Sorry. If this sounds more like a sob story than a confession, but it is something I really needed to get off my chest this morning. As I feel really low about myself, pray for me. Reddit if you do not pray, keep me in your thoughts, I feel myself spiraling.

Title: Feel like no matter what happens in life, I am always going to be suicidal.
Thread
I have been suicidal for years now. I have even just landed a new job that I start next week, and it is so overwhelming right now that all I wish I could do is just leave this earth. Its like whatever emotion I am feeling, whether it be positive, negative or nothing that I just want to die. Why cannot I just?
Comments
Me, too. Turns out we are not alone there. This whole other type of suicidal, where it just kind of stays with you for your entire life. You just kind of learn to live with it, and it becomes like a part of your personality and your identity. It taints everything you do and say and think it very hard to overcome. Because of that, the best results I have gotten from trying to get rid of it is a medication called gabapentin it meant for seizures, but they have found it works really well to help cure anxiety, caused by long term stress. It has made the world of difference for me. I am not sure if you are seeing a doctor, but maybe you should reach out to someone and see if they feel comfortable prescribing it to you. It worth a shot, in my opinion. Tell me more about his job. If you feel comfortable

Title: Hello there everyone. I recently had a situation regarding talking to people about the subject of mental health and would like your thoughts if possible.

Hello there everyone. I recently had a situation regarding talking to people about the subject of mental health, and would like your thoughts if possible, to help you undertand the situation. I have been diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and depression by doctors at a young age. My years have been geared toward achieving a high quality of life and to not be held down by these labels. As such, I have been engaged in activities such as public address, announcing volunteering in mental health advocacy events, I mental health, phone linesconfusion and also engaged in public speaking events and competitions. Talking about dealing with my diagnoses and overcoming them in short, mental health is a passionate personal subject for me, and something I am open to speak to others about. I work at a university part time in canada, announcing sporting events and work with students. I early confusion, as I work with them on a weekly basis, I make the effort to communicate with them, get to know them better and to pull them from their phones every once in a while. Haconfusion. I recently had a conversation with a co worker. Early confusion regarding mental health. She initially had an aloof nature towards me for a few months, was not sure if she liked disliked me as she initially talked to everyone but meconfusion. But as time went on, she warmed up and we have many pleasant conversations I nature, yoga, career aspirations, sports, etc. Confusion, which encouraged my talkingAbout mental health with her. In canada, there is an awareness campaign created by the canadian telecommunications company bell canada in an effort to raise awareness and combat stigma surrounding mental illness in canada. They call it bell let talk. They heavily promote it in february at the school. Our conversation about this campaign lead to the mental health topic, where I asked this person, what is your perspective on mental health to which she answered that? A loaded question. And at this time, I cannot give an answer in all my years asking this question to thousands of people. This was the first time I ever got an answer as such, and it has left me wondering the next time I talked to her another event shiftconfusion, I noticed that she was more reserved than before. Short answers hi and bye, approachconfusion, seemingly more aloof to me than I have ever seen her. The questions I have are as follows, what is your take on her response? Was I out of line to ask the question should I pull her aside and address the situation? I asking her to? Let me know if I ever hit a sensitive nerve with herconfusion. The last thing I look to do is to offend people? And as I work with this person, I do not want to make her or anyone feel uncomfortable in a work situation. Any chance to hear your answers would be greatly appreciated. As I do want to understand other perspectives and learn waysOf navigating future conversations with others regarding mental health. Thank you.

From my experience, I would say she is got trauma in her past, or some type of mental health issue that she is not comfortable sharing, maybe with her or someone she is close to. She said that a loaded question, which means that she felt she would be losing. No matter how she answered, she aloof because you triggered her defense mechanism. She tried opening up. And things got a little risky. When you asked about a thing she was not yet comfortable. Sharing being direct will not solve the problem. Try instead showing her you care by doing nice things for her. Nothing grand that would attract attention. Small stuff she might appreciate, give her a chance to gradually get comfortable with you again and definitely do not tell other people about what happened. They all just make it worse. Always remember, although some people are happy, being defined by their mental illness and like the respect that comes with overcoming it and speaking publicly about it. Others do not want it to define who they are, and they are just trying to get rid of it. She a person before she is a patient, she prefers being treated as such best of luck.

Her behavior feels very immature to me. She lacks empathy for you. Clearly, whether she wants to make you jealous, likes to play with your self esteem or sees you as a friend. In that moment, neither is nice and considered. I do not think such behavior belongs into a secure and loving relationship, and I think you should think about your relationship. Does it make you feel loved and accepted? Can you talk about your feelings with her? And does she listen and change in order to be more considerate? If you say no to both questions, I would reevaluate. If the relationship is the best for you

I have been in that same endless loop countless times too, but I swear it does come to an end. I cannot tell you how many times since my suicide attempts I have been so relieved that I did not succeed. Youll be glad you stayed, too. It will not be easy, and it may take some time to get to that point, but you will get there and be glad that you stuck around. So please stick around. We all die eventually. So if life really is that unbearable, it is not for forever, but you will not feel like this for the rest of your life, even if it is all you have known in your life so far, I and the world will miss you if you go

Try, do nice things for others. I know it sounds easier said than done, especially because you probably feel like you need to focus on yourself, but perhaps helping others will give you a feeling of purpose and make you feel good. I do not know if that makes sense. Either way. Stay strong. There are people who care about you in this world.

Title: Sick and tired of all the bullshit cure suggestions.

I am fucking sick and tired of all the bullshit suggestions people make about getting better. No, exercise and a better diet will not, magically make my brain function properly. Yes, I have tried medication, it did nothing. Yes, I have tried. Tis it did nothing. No, I have not tried therapy. But therapists have literally refused to treat me because of my autism and communication disorder. Fuck this shit. Every day, I get closer and closer to ending it. I just want to enjoy life. But none of this bullshit works.
Comments
I have tried therapy. Heck, I am trying it again, but with no results. I keep hoping there is an answer somewhere out there of how I can get to be. Normal medication has not worked either. But being out of the house makes me feel calmer. I just want to enjoy my hobbies again and be able to work. I feel so guilty that I have been months away from work, but I also feel sluggish. My brain cannot focus on anything. Some days, I cannot even do the bare minimum to take care of myself. I was recently diagnosed with autism, and maybe that is a factor that makes this more difficult. But I do not know what to do with that information. My therapist has completely ignored it. I do not know what the point of asking for the diagnosis was and was told by other people the symptoms are the important thing to treat, not the diagnosis, and his approach is right. So maybe I am wrong. I do not know, but I am not seeing any improvements.

I suppose that you could say nobody really cares about each other, but I am not sure that is actually true. I think it is more complex than saying someone cares or they do not care it not a dichotomous issue. Caring can look many different ways, and to say that nobody cares implies that truly, not one single person cares. And that also seems rather extreme. I could see why someone might say that nobody cares, because that can definitely be how it feels. Sometimes the way we feel is incredibly compelling and feels absolutely true and meaningful. I just also consider the possibility that maybe that is all just my perception that when I feel depressed, even if it is a lot of the time, I have a really stubborn belief that life is futile. This is just an idea, though, it just a possibility that life is futile, it not something that I can actually know with certainty it possible. Yes, that life is futile. And when I feel really low, I tend to believe that life is futile. The thing is it might not be super often, but sometimes, even if just for a few seconds, I am not depressed. And in those moments, I feel like life actually does have some degree of meaning. And I have a perspective that my presence here does have a point, even if my point here is not the grandest one in the world I recognize in these moments that I am in a healthierState of mind and a more rational state of mind, and that cynicism is real and that it is possible to be a realist without being catastrophic. I just think it is funny that perspective changes. This suggests to me that a lot of my thoughts, perceptions, etc. Are impermanent and transient, and that my mood pushes me back and forth, sometimes standing back from all of that. And considering that your perspective is really just an idea and is not necessarily true, even if it very much feels true in the moment, the lens on our metaphorical glasses change. Sometimes the world looks rosier than others. I know you may have been in pain for a long time, and you may feel like there really are not any good moments, but I would encourage you to consider whether that is the whole picture of your time on earth thus far. And if it is, please know that I care about your pain, and you did not deserve this. But you may need to participate in the process of trying to get out of this hole. If nothing changes, then nothing changes on a rare day. Sometimes just feeling the sun on my face is enough for me

Sure enough, I go from being stressed about the job to being stressed about finding a job been job searching since before thanksgiving, and nothing except more positions in the same role that made me so sick. I have been seeing a therapist for a while, and I am on medication, but I am going to have to give those up if this continues it to the point where I have friends asking me if they should call the hospital for me. I want to just say, yes, go ahead. But that means an even bigger financial hole. I am trying to find work so I can pay to get help. But every time I get a rejection email or ghosted, I sink lower and lower. The last time I felt this worthless, I attempted suicide, didn go to the hospital, then cannot go. Now, have to flat out, lie to my friends and my therapist and say, I am okay. When I know I am not, I would love to just take the time and check in to an outpatient program and try to sort everything out, but that would cost money I do not have and will not get anytime soon.

I am bald and in college, so I kind of get where you are coming from. Also, my ex goes to the same school, which messes with my head sometimes what really helped me was joining a club tennis for me but do whatever you enjoyconfusion, and trying to make a groupchat with the people around me in classes, go into everything with the goal of being a good person seeing it as making friends. Rather than finding a girl. If you are a cool, positive dude, then people will be attracted to you. Tennis is great, because getting the blood flowing naturally makes you more outgoing and theres a lot of opportunities to be kind, encouraging and funny and regarding your feelings of resentment, I had that, too. She cheated on me with a dude she was friends with, and that still haunts me. I only know his first name, and anytime I hear it now, I get a jolt of anxiety. Try and do what makes you happy, and put all of your energy into making others feel comfortable and uplifted. And things seem to work out better. Happy face or smiley

I feel guilty. I feel absolutely terrible. I cannot stop being so fucking me. People are afraid of me in a bad way. One of my friends runs from me all this sudden, I do not know why I try to talk to her, but nothing works. I do not even know what I did or if I just carry a weight of dread with me everywhere. And there is another girl who runs from me for some reason. I genuinely do not know she was jokingly scared at first, and now she is genuinely scared. I do not understand. There is also people I deeply hate because they hate me. People really hate me sometimes. I do not know why I try to be kind. I really do try, but something happens, and then people do not like me. Bad thoughts are coming back again. I might start self harm again.

No, you are not a bad person, even if you are a scary person or a creepy person, that does not make you bad. More mature. People will see past your goth aesthetic to the artistic cat lover.

If you had your last day to die and you passed away, what do you think god would say about you, your life and everything you have done?

In terms of assuming that I could have done more, that I could have fought harder, that I could have relied on him more in my life.

It depends on the god. A loving god would say he or she was sorry for all the suffering. Then explain how it was necessary for me to experience.

Title: Lost all motivation to do anything.
Thread
I keep thinking back on that time in my life where I use to put in my into everything I would do at work I would come in on my days off work hours, work hard and made sure to always keep myself busy. I went to school, had a set schedule where I was always keeping myself busy and making sure I do not fall short on anything I did. I had a stable relationship a couple really close friends and I was happy but in recent times I have found myself falling into a deep depression. I wake up every morning and struggle to get out of bed I am always late for work because I stopped caring. I lost my ability to set goals for myself and have a strong work ethic. I lost my boyfriend a job that I loved, a car that I had been working hard to save up for most of my friends due to having a busy schedule and my happiness aswell, although my life is not too bad and I have a family that loves me and a roof over my head, I have grown to hate living and I feel miserable. I am stuck in this rut that I cannot get out of, I know that the only direction from here is up. So does anyone have any advice going forward that they would like to share about getting out of a negative mindset? To do I have lost motivation to do anything and I feelMiserable with where my life is at. How do I get out of this?
Comments
Yeah, lack of joy from doing things sucks motivation out of stuff.

Title: I am pregnant and I want to kill myself.

My monthly ob appointment was the other day I tried to bring up the severe issues I have been having. I mostly saw an intern or whoever he was who was just there to collect information to pass on to the actual doctor. When I saw the actual doctor, I feel like I got the brush off. He basically just came in and wanted out of there as quickly as possible. I could barely speak to him like I had planned. I told him, I am supposed to be on meds, aripiprazole and sertraline, but have not been for quite some time, talked about maybe starting with some counseling or something. I felt like I got dismissed, and nobody really had any sincere interest in helping me. All I know is that it has been a number of days, and I have heard nothing from anyone about it story of my life. I guess I learned from an early age that it is everyone for themselves. I am nothing. I am gutter trash. Nobody cares. I will just jump off a bridge as soon as my son is born, it is for the best. More for him, he does not deserve this

I have never posted before, but really wanted to respond to you. I was suicidal. During my pregnancy, I was no longer on my meds, wanted to die, and had repeated thoughts about driving off a cliff. This went on for months. I did not tell my psychiatrist or my husband how bad it got. I was afraid I would be institutionalized, I was also terrified how I could be responsible for another life when all I wanted to do was end mine. When my son was born, it all changed. I think hormonal changes renewed life, purpose. And the sheer joy of seeing my little guy all helped lift the depths of depression I had been experiencing. So I want to tell you, there is hope you can get through this, and it can get better. All my best to you,

I am sorry you are feeling this way sometimes, unfortunately, doctors can be overwhelmed at hospitals and forget how important it is to pay full attention, and that is wrong, but it is your right to demand their full attention and get the help you need. Pregnancy is so much of a physical burden, and the hormonal and body changes can cause a lot of anxiety and fear. It normal and could be overcome. In the meanwhile, it will help to find someone who understands what you are going through. If your partner is not there, then maybe family friends or a community who is gone through that experience. Remember that your son, when born, will literally need you more than anyone else. I am sure that also, once he is born, your love for him can change how you feel. In the meantime, please seek therapy to help you overcome those feelings so you can enjoy your life as a mother, white heart

I do not get how people like you can do this do not get me wrong. I am proud of you and hope you can get out of this hell hole we call depression, but I just cant. I feel like I am either overextending or what I am saying is dumb. I have just gotten used to it and kept quiet. So just how do you ask for help?

Title: Thought taking it all off my chest might help.

Hello. I am a year old female. I am living a pretty normal, average life, but I am actually a loserconfusion. I am currently studying in a college, and my parents pay my tuition. My parents are very caring, and so is my younger brother. It has been around years. I have been struggling to keep myself like I had been before lively, smart, hardworking, and that kind of stuffconfusion. I have been failing classes, gaining weight, crying randomly and have not been caring about the consequences at all. I have been feeling like my mind is rotten and cannot concentrate on anything at all. I have been indulging myself in sensory pleasures like binge eating, binge watching porn, mindlessly scrolling through social media sites, just laying around and sleeping. The only love of my lifeconfusion through the years, I have always tried to improve myself, trying to read books, listening to music, exercising, religion, finding god, etc. But after sometime, I just find myself falling back and getting worse everyday is very monotonous, and I feel like I cannot remember most of my life, and it is been the same all along, I have been told that I was smart as a kid who used to get decent grades, the teachers used to like me, and I have always managed to make atleast friends. I used to be the last priority in a group of, though, tears of happinessconfusion. So yes, I have been pretty accustomed to being alone. My parents lost their it child.So were always overprotective of me and my brother very understandable indeed, but that had reduced my interaction with the world even more. I have always been a homebody. I have not always hated to go out, but now I definitely do. As I grew older, I learned that my mother had depression, she had struggled a lot in life. She is actually the breadwinner of our family, my father, who has a list of failed businessesconfusion, even though very loving and kind is an immature man, he lost him mother when he was a month. New bornconfusion. I have had to act like my father mother multiple times since I was a child, and parents fighting and arguing until my ears go deaf. And then making up is just normal been happening everytime I have been in a good mood since I was a kid, I have also had my fair share of beatings and scoldings, but I have grown now, so not anymore. But then there are good aspects, too. I have always had food, clothes, a home, good education, electronics, other necessities and support from them. So I do understand some aspects of my life that could have led to me become such a loser. But life is not really that bad for me to give it up on. But here I am ready to die everyday and trying to make sense of what led me to fall in love with death so much that I might even cheat on sleep is justA walmart version of death, huhconfusion? But I am still in my right mind and a very loyal person. My mom went to see the doctor recently for acidity issues. Then when she was discussing about her doctor visit with her personal therapist, who is me, by the way, I am my family therapist. Everyone talks to meconfusion. She bought up something about the burn marks on her body, which rung a bell in my usually dull mind. And that night, I could faintly recall seeing my mother attempting to burn herself to death in the kitchen, and my father rushing to stop her. I was a kid when I watched all of this go down in front of my eyes, so I still have not been able to recall the whys whats and hows of the whole ordeal, but it is been eating up my already shrunken brain. I thought of asking for a detailed explanation, but I am very afraid. As my mom has been put on medication for depression and anxiety, a multiple times by a general physician, and I might just trigger something unnecessary. Also, I have no capacity currently to listen to another sob story or stupid excuses that my dad come up with. I would rather die. I love my parents. My adore. My dad. He is genuinely adorable, and my mom has my utmost respect for what she has achieved despite her conditionsconfusion. Now, I might have discovered another reason for me being like I am, but that doesNot solve anything at all. Rather, it is been bothering me even more. Primarily, my goal had been to not kill myself anytime soon by any means, sensory pleasures or whatever. But that just made me more miserable in a long run. And sometimes I sound very contradicting and stupid, like right now, but, well, it is what it is. I also want to die, but I know not to kill myself. And honestly, I think I am pretty much over killing myself, and I have done a pretty good job and have not attempted suicide, unlike my mother and my brother, too, actually, but he just couldn. He said he could not do it, and that, too required courage. So technically, he tried to attempt, but couldn he is fine. Sinceconfusion, I have tried various methods to get out of this rut, which have majorly failed, but one still remains untried, and that is opening up. By the way, professional help and therapy is an option, but also a taboo. So that is out for sometime atleastconfusion. I have had many friends in my life, but not close enough for me to open up. I am uncomfortable opening up. What if I am just an ungrateful spoiled brat who whines about petty things, not knowing how much suffering life gives to other people I have never met? Who am I to talk about killing myself when people are dying? Not because they want to, but because they do not get food to fill their stomachsAnd a house and clothes to shelter them. So I took my weak ass on internet to find some true friends, and I made a few and ended up listening to their sob story and felt like, why burden them with mine just to increase their sorrows? Hah, no need. I just keep it to myself. And same goes for my family would not want to bother them. But where has all these considerations for others brought me here? Hah been tired of bottling up everything but still pathetic. And so I am still anonymous and probably will never have a name for myself, because who am I to deserve such privilege? I realise some of my thoughts may come off as poor, excuses and irrational, even but I do not know why I have been giving so much of importance to me and my feelings. Why cannot I just open up? Some rich kids cry about not getting their favourite shoes. So what is stopping me from crying about some bullshit in my life and accepting it? Am I trying to protect my fragile ego? Whatever it is it has never helped and never will? I hope this rant here alleviates my craving to be heard and pitied, even though I do not know if anyone will read it whole. Ha. But even if I shout into the void, I still get to shout atleast, I just wake up tomorrow feeling pathetic and try doing some exercise and drink a lot of water. Then tryPreparing for the exam I likely fail again atleast I am trying even if not my best I am trying I keep trying.

I read it whole. I know that probably you will not believe me, but you are not a burden and your feelings are valid. There are people that are dying of hunger, but your problems and theirs are so different that trying to compare them does not make sense. It just makes you feel more miserable. If you want to write to me I am here. You do not have to listen to my sob story, but I can listen to yours if you wanted to say something more also, if I asked you to write to me, it means that I do not think you will make my condition worse or make me more miserable. Sometimes telling what you feel to other people can make other people feel understood

I do not have a job. I do not plan to. All I do is sleep browse the internet and listen to music, as do most of you. I also do not want to go to therapy. There is nothing anyone can do or say. I think I do not take my meds nor supplements, as I find them useless. I am not even trying and see no good reason to, nor do I have the energy. My mom is reasonably pissed off and is telling me to either get a job or move out. Guess, I will be homeless in a matter of weeks, months. I do not want to be in that position of, but I do not care enough to do shit about it feeling kind of sad and hopeless. Didnt exactly want to possibly die this year, but I have no other option.

I am years old and I have been abused by my parents for a long time. My life has been a nightmare for the last years, getting hit by them because of whatever thing I was doing, it became something normal. They were screaming and insulting me all the time. My mother was calling me asshole. Each time she told me something, there are so many kinds of physical and psychological abuse in this story that I am not going to describe them. This situation now stopped since couid, because my brother came to live in our house again, and the situation became way more normal. But now I have to live with the two persons that made me live this nightmare. I feel broken. I am not a normal person, and now that I am out of that situation, I can see better the shit that I was living in. I think about suicide. Every time it gives me anxiety to hear my mother say my name.

Its a hard concept to fathom to most, because parents should be our refuge from the cold world outside. But in our case, the cold world is warmer than our own home. The best advice, which is hard to follow, because I still struggle with it, is to leave the toxic environment you are in. I know it is easy to say, but difficult to put into play, save money, get a job, find someone who has a small place to rent. It really helped me find my independence and made me rely on myself rather than my parents. Its hard, really hard, but I come home to peace, which is what we all want

Title: All of my siblings are having kids getting married and living life. What is wrong with me?
Thread
I guess its come to this point in my life where I cannot stand counseling. I do not like talking to people, and I cant find comfort in anything. So I am here. I am years old. I live with my parents, I have no friends, my parents are not the greatest, and I myself have a plethora of issues. I grew up surrounded by people that made and make me feel alone. Last night, one of my siblings came over out of the blue to have dinner with us. No one had told me about the dinner, and they live a good hours away. We do not see them a lot, so I did not think nothing of it. Well come this morning. I hear from my mom that they are pregnant, apparently, the whole family knew, and I was the only one that hadn I am the last sibling in my family that has not had a child there, other sibling that is a half sibling who is very mentally psychotic in and out of mental hospitals. Jail. He a genuine threat to society. At this point in my life, I am on the same level as him. I am soo, mentally fucked. I grew up with so many different traumas affecting me now, I just hate it. I know so many people that milk their mental health to get attention, and I could not be more ashamed of me and my head the thought of someone else knowing what I think and goThrough makes me cringe. I have spurts of instant sadness. I feel my heart flutter with sadness, and the feeling is so hard to express. I spent most of my childhood purposely punching, cutting, smacking myself when I did things wrong or disappointed others. My mother is an alcoholic and has spent her time in my life telling me why I am useless and a terrible son. I know that I am not a perfect or good person. I feel like hearing that I am useless all my life and beating it into my head has caused me to truly believe it. I do not go outside as much anymore and find that being alone where others cant see me is the safest I wish I could enjoy my life. But I cant. I cannot explain the feeling of hearing that every sibling around you is living a good life, and they are already progressing so far, I feel so overly worthless as a child, to my parents and as an adult to society, my parents have always wanted grandchildren, and god forbid, if I have any, it wont be any happy surprise to them, as they will already have plenty. If anything happens by then, I am so mentally unstable that I could not bear the thought of a women wanting to be with me. I grew up around people that shunned emotion and only showed anger. I have always been a sensitive person all my life and desire. Hearing someone truly say I loveYou with the honest intent of love it so pathetic and sad that I have to chase a sentence that is considered the bare minimum in other families I have always lived the life of the oh nice kid I am the youngest so every other child gets to experience things with my parents for the first time and I am always left with the experience of anything being handed off as meh I never complain about stuff to anyone and I do not bring others into my mental messes I try to do things the best I can and its still not good enough to people around me and to myself I will always think lesser of myself because of how others think of me I have tried to kill myself plenty of times wrist slit I did as a kid I did not do right overdosing lead to throwing up the last time I truly was done I chickened out at the end I was going for a weapon and was set on it and just broke down crying because I knew I did not want to live but I did not want to die my siblings are completely on with their life and I am not even close with mine I do not know if I want to live anymore but I do not know if I want to die what is wrong with me am I just someone that is not meant to have kids be in a relationship or live aLife of happiness has my rough childhood ruined the possibility of ever being happy and am I in for a ride of my life getting even worse? I want to have kids so bad I want to be able to raise my own kids to be happy and full of life unlike my own life. I guess I am here because I just wanted people to see my life for once. And maybe there is people that feel the same as I do. I am not looking for comfort. I am looking for a solution. If anyone is genuinely dealing with the same situation with siblings, tell me what you did to start down your path

I am tired of crying, tired of getting up every day and going through the motions, trying to find just a bit of happiness, which is soon overcome by pain, hot and cold. Two different things love and pain, two opposite things. What? The difference to me? There is none. I experience hot and cold, others change thier attitudes. So quickly, I do not know whats real or what is fakeconfusion, and I feel love and pain. But the pain overwhelms the depression, the anxiety, the saddness, the ache, the pain. It all crashes down like the waves overflowing, pushing and drowning. I am floating in a sea of tears, just waiting for the time to drown. Maybe I look forward to it. Maybe I know that it will end this suffering, because I do not want to go on anymore. I do not want to try anymore. I just want it all to stop, to end. Maybe, then I can finally find peace.

Title: Confusion I fucked up my life.
Thread
I here I moved across the country to wyoming, from florida with my boyfriend, confusion, who I was not even with for a year yet stupid. I know I quit my job that I loved. I left the place I called home and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. Things are not going smoothly. Its the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues. Communication has gotten the worst it is ever been minor, but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me he would be better about lack of trust in him due to his lies baggage on his end, causing major strain between the two of us mother in law, exesconfusion. I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end, since I quit my well paying job in florida to come here. My credit cards have not gotten paid since november and my bank account is, he told me he was going to take care of me financially. He hasnt. I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in florida for years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings were not reliant upon some guy I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced bed bath apartment back in florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now I threw away everything I valued andLoved about my life for some guy that cannot even be honest with me on a consistent basis for a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me for a guy who just does not understand me, even though he likes to act like he does, I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid. And you want to know what the worst part is. I do not think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make a month now I am not only broke I am in severe debt now things will never be the same because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was. I guess I cannot even do that, right? I am quite literally good for nothing. I should have done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. I do not even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I cannot even be mad at him. I did it to myself.

Hey there. Op we all make mistakes. A you are very young and have your whole life ahead, set small goals for yourself and check them off one at a time. You could focus on getting out of debt and try to take control of your own happiness by getting your own place again. Look into food stamps if times are tough or other programs to help people struggling it ok to accept the help. Also stay positive, get minutes of exercise in a day, minutes of reading and min of quiet breathing. You can do it. You seriously, can I fucked up my life at and lost it all took ne years to get back on track. It was tough, but I was determined nowadays. I look back on that years later, and I cannot believe that was me. This struggle will pass. You ve got this

Be kind to yourself. I was once in debt on my credit cards, declared bankruptcy. Girlfriend dumped me after giving me a disease, wanted to die, lived in poverty for a decade. Inherited money when my dad and uncle died today, I own my own home debt free. My point is, life changes.

You have every right to complain, regardless of age or state of life. I have not been a teen in a while, but I deal with them for a living. The amount of stress put on you from schooling, parents, employers and yourselves, is just compounded by social media. You will learn skills as you grow and mature on how to handle them. But for now, just try and enjoy being young, stress and anxiety and all that shit continues to come for sure, it will not get easier, but you will get stronger than you ever thought possible. If you are thinking suicide is the answer, please reach out for help. Talking to someone really does help you so much you are stronger than this feeling you have right now. We are the people who have had these thoughts before and with work and patience and possibly medications we have overcome it, stay strong and focus on one thing at time and also drink lots of water. Best of luck,

Being an adult is not necessarily worse than being a teenager. I was miserable for a solid of my high school years. Now, I am only miserable every once in a while. It not a perfect life I have got, but it is a good one. All things considered my mom in a similar boat. We ve had multiple conversations where she is told me she is the happiest she is ever been in her entire life, and she just turned. She likes her job, her husband, her new cats, everything coming up milhouse for her.

We are also hurt by our loved ones the most I do not really care what my colleagues think, but a comment from my father can really get me make a list of people you care for, then tell them individually, you love them. If you want to stop specific hurtful behaviours, you can look up therapy. If that is too much to start with, there are quite good ted talks on this topic or videos, with therapists giving advice.

Physical illness, depression sucks. I have been in the same place since I was I am now, and yea, the world can be cruel because I am here working my ass off trying my best with all these health problems, while the majority of people in this world do not know what real struggle is. They do not know what is like to have insomnia, physical pain headaches for years, then losing the ability to listen to music because of those headaches, which are really bad and then lose weight like crazy and get up to work after not sleeping well or not sleeping at all with the headache and depression, which is also really bad. I hardly can socialize properly. Now, I graduated high school depressed, did two years of college depressed and got a job depressed. The world system is made for the majority of people who have normal lives and get to live normal lives. These people basically live their lives and get old, while most of us are fucked up from the start and no. The world does not care about depressed or people with physical issues. At the end of the day, people only care about themselves.

I feel you if I manage to pass my classes this semester, I should get my associates degree, which is credits I am, and it is taken me and a half years and a lot of failed classes. I still have so much to go, and it is so hard to stay motivated, I do not know what I want to do, and it is just so overwhelming at times, I wish I could offer help, but I guess I just wanted to let you know you are not alone. I am just trying to move forward, taking it a day at a time. I know it is hard, but everyone goes through school at different speeds. Many of my high school classmates are graduating college this semester, and here I am only half done. It sucks. I truly wish you success in your classes this semester. Keep pushing and do not be afraid to get help or use other college resources

Title: I think I am depressed.
Thread
I am confusion. For the last couple of months, I have started to feel like shit, my partner works full time at night. I get to see her days a week for about hours each time. My life is a consistent circle. I get up, I go to work, I come home sort the kids out watch I get in bed and again, the same days a week my children are young, so it is not like we can go out all the time as they have school the next day. I know I am lonely, but I have now been accusing my girlfriend of doing things I cheating on me, not trusting her and more than likely I on wrong. And I now feel unwanted. I spoke to her about this and she really likes her job and I want her to be happy and to enjoy what she does. I had a bad break down a couple of nights ago and I feel so bad the worse thing is she saw this and now I feel like a dick and makes me feel like she does not want me more and sees me less of a man. She was ment to have a extra day off this week, but she has picked up an extra shift. As she said, she needs the extra money. And yes, we do need money. But after everything I have said, she is still going to go in work. I just do not know what do to anymore. IDo not want her to be happy, but I am also very sad and lonely, not hungry. When it is time to eat. I have decided today to try drinking, to numb my pain. I do not want anyone else, really, to keep me company, just want her. I just want to close my eyes and not wake up. I am not looking to kill my self, but its really hitting me hard. I just do not know what to do, help and advice needed.

I really sorry you are going through this. You sound really lonely since you do not get to see your wife as often as you would like. Loneliness is a really terrible thing, and it is not easy to cope with. Are you able to seek the help of a psychiatrist or a therapist? I really think that talking to a therapist about the way you feel and then seeking a diagnosis for depression would help you out that way. Maybe they can prescribe you some medication that can make you feel better.

Title: I have just realized that no one is really there for me.
Thread
I used to think I have a small but real circle of friends, people I could count on when I need help, but I just realized that its a one sided thing. I am always the one helping them, whether its about life problems or money, especially money, pretty much all of them owe me money. One of them owes me thousands and has not paid me for years. I even consider this person as my best friend. What should I do? Aside from reading books and working as a freelance artist, there is literally nothing going on with my life. I am at home, and I almost never talk to anyone due to some unavoidable circumstances. I had to move in a place far from home where I know pretty much nobody. I have lost faith in everyone, and I just want to cut off all these friends. I feel like my life is meaningless, please someone tell me what I should do. Please help me
Comments
When people only take they are not friends, they are using you. I had those in my past. I much rather be alone than have fake people in my life at age. It is where I cut every single friend I had because they used me because I was weak. What should you do? Don give anyone money? Form? This group of people demand your money back. That is your money, not theirs. Their frienship that ends up in you being used and in pain is not worth it. Get what is yours. And if you can have someone helping you get your money back and when they return it cut them off of your life. Does the new place you are at have any social clubs or places? Do you have any gym nearby to go to and start moving your body and yourself out of the house? Some, I feel you on losing faith in everyone. But remember, not everyone is evil. You all meet good friends in the future, but that will take time. You, firstly, need to realise what a friend is and what a friend isn. And people who only take from you and never are there for you are not worth it. And since you have mentioned, you are alone in life. Maybe a professional in your area is your first shot at improving. Then see what you want from yourself and life. What are things you want to change improve upon? Make a list and figure small steps toGet there. I believe in you.

Title: All of my siblings are having kids getting married and living life. What is wrong with me?
Thread
I guess its come to this point in my life where I cannot stand counseling. I do not like talking to people, and I cant find comfort in anything. So I am here. I am years old. I live with my parents, I have no friends, my parents are not the greatest, and I myself have a plethora of issues. I grew up surrounded by people that made and make me feel alone. Last night, one of my siblings came over out of the blue to have dinner with us. No one had told me about the dinner, and they live a good hours away. We do not see them a lot, so I did not think nothing of it. Well come this morning. I hear from my mom that they are pregnant, apparently, the whole family knew, and I was the only one that hadn I am the last sibling in my family that has not had a child there, other sibling that is a half sibling who is very mentally psychotic in and out of mental hospitals. Jail. He a genuine threat to society. At this point in my life, I am on the same level as him. I am soo, mentally fucked. I grew up with so many different traumas affecting me now, I just hate it. I know so many people that milk their mental health to get attention, and I could not be more ashamed of me and my head the thought of someone else knowing what I think and goThrough makes me cringe. I have spurts of instant sadness. I feel my heart flutter with sadness, and the feeling is so hard to express. I spent most of my childhood purposely punching, cutting, smacking myself when I did things wrong or disappointed others. My mother is an alcoholic and has spent her time in my life telling me why I am useless and a terrible son. I know that I am not a perfect or good person. I feel like hearing that I am useless all my life and beating it into my head has caused me to truly believe it. I do not go outside as much anymore and find that being alone where others cant see me is the safest I wish I could enjoy my life. But I cant. I cannot explain the feeling of hearing that every sibling around you is living a good life, and they are already progressing so far, I feel so overly worthless as a child, to my parents and as an adult to society, my parents have always wanted grandchildren, and god forbid, if I have any, it wont be any happy surprise to them, as they will already have plenty. If anything happens by then, I am so mentally unstable that I could not bear the thought of a women wanting to be with me. I grew up around people that shunned emotion and only showed anger. I have always been a sensitive person all my life and desire. Hearing someone truly say I loveYou with the honest intent of love it so pathetic and sad that I have to chase a sentence that is considered the bare minimum in other families I have always lived the life of the oh nice kid I am the youngest so every other child gets to experience things with my parents for the first time and I am always left with the experience of anything being handed off as meh I never complain about stuff to anyone and I do not bring others into my mental messes I try to do things the best I can and its still not good enough to people around me and to myself I will always think lesser of myself because of how others think of me I have tried to kill myself plenty of times wrist slit I did as a kid I did not do right overdosing lead to throwing up the last time I truly was done I chickened out at the end I was going for a weapon and was set on it and just broke down crying because I knew I did not want to live but I did not want to die my siblings are completely on with their life and I am not even close with mine I do not know if I want to live anymore but I do not know if I want to die what is wrong with me am I just someone that is not meant to have kids be in a relationship or live aLife of happiness has my rough childhood ruined the possibility of ever being happy and am I in for a ride of my life getting even worse? I want to have kids so bad I want to be able to raise my own kids to be happy and full of life unlike my own life. I guess I am here because I just wanted people to see my life for once. And maybe there is people that feel the same as I do. I am not looking for comfort. I am looking for a solution. If anyone is genuinely dealing with the same situation with siblings, tell me what you did to start down your path

Worst advice to give to a depressed person, because it just makes us feel worse when we cannot come up with something. How about instead, focus on one little thing if you want a change that made you happy first or at least content. Be it something like I took a shower today or I ate something good. These things can make a world of difference in mindset.

Having the same kind of feelings here and can perfectly relate the way I cope with that is hitting the gym, consistently getting the sun on me and walking in the nature. Even a park is sufficient if you cannot leave the city for some reasonconfusion. The connection with the nature keeps me going through the day and moves away my bad thoughts.

I am doing a little better compared to months ago, even though everything is almost the same. Being grateful was really difficult then, but I do believe being grateful is a practice. Gratitude practice, say thing every day. That is good. Set an alarm for me. It is so difficult since my standards are so high.

Comments
Suicide is supposed to be the end of the line. Many people do not seem able to handle endings. It can be seen in entertainment all the time with all the reboots, sequels, etc. This is part of why suicide attempts are hard to go through with, and can also start explaining how the aftermath might be like this, what comes after the end and all that I think feeling like this is valid, understandable, but it does open up a vulnerability when emotions possibly return. So it is best to have someone to turn to for help.

I here I moved across the country to wyoming, from florida with my boyfriend, confusion, who I was not even with for a year yet stupid. I know I quit my job that I loved. I left the place I called home and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. Things are not going smoothly. Its the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues. Communication has gotten the worst it is ever been minor, but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me he would be better about lack of trust in him due to his lies baggage on his end, causing major strain between the two of us mother in law, exesconfusion. I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end, since I quit my well paying job in florida to come here. My credit cards have not gotten paid since november and my bank account is, he told me he was going to take care of me financially. He hasnt. I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in florida for years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings were not reliant upon some guy I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced bed bath apartment back in florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now I threw away everything I valued andLoved about my life for some guy that cannot even be honest with me on a consistent basis for a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me for a guy who just does not understand me, even though he likes to act like he does, I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid. And you want to know what the worst part is. I do not think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make a month now I am not only broke I am in severe debt now things will never be the same because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was. I guess I cannot even do that, right? I am quite literally good for nothing. I should have done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. I do not even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I cannot even be mad at him. I did it to myself.

Start by putting yourself first make saving up to move away your top priority dont put anymore energy into this relationship or man get a second job if you need to I would not even tell him that you are trying to leave him use your living situation as a place to stay for now I am not sure how badly you are in debt but if your credit is already completely shot under confusion I would not worry about your creditors times like these are exactly what bankruptcy is for it will suck but most people can start rebuilding their credit with secured credit cards quickly after and are almost back to normal years after a bankruptcy years and it is completely off your record youl have to look into the specifics yourself for your particular level of debt. But my point is you can start from scratch and have a successful financial life again. Youre are only you have more time than you think to get out of this and recreate your life. You can make an even better one than you had in florida and you will be wiser now that you have had this experience, your bringing yourself down for being human. Shit happens. We make the wrong decisions. But when your looking back on your life, you will be grateful for these moment that forced you to grow and change. You left your entire life behind for a chance at love that takes balls and do not let anyone tell youOtherwise you took a shot. It did not go your way, but now you will never look back wondering what if you can turn this all around? It is not to late. Start pouring all your energy into your own cup and you will succeed, wishing you the best.

Dwelling in the past leads to depression. Dwelling in the future leads to anxiety. Dwelling in the present leads to living it. One thing to think about the past and to plan for the future. But dwelling there in your mind is not healthy at all. You cannot enjoy life in its fullest unless you can live in the here and now.

This is a very cool question. I think the shortest answer with some assumptionsconfusion is yes. Nostalgia often comes with expectations of a context that may no longer exist nor apply when expectations are not met. That can elicit a depressive reaction. There is disappointment, maybe some hopelessness, etc. I think a slightly different frame of reference is that nostalgia is fueled on. Feels of comfort and familiarity. For myself, I know I have prolonged depressive episodes because I am comfortable in that emotional state. I do not think this is exactly nostalgia, but there is certainly the possibility that these experiences can become convoluted, especially since memory is incredibly emotionally biased. We quickly get into state based memory here, where a place you are in or activity you are doing carries with it. Depressive emotions, as a result, nostalgia for that place or activity also drags along a nostalgia for the depressive emotion that is linked to it in your memory. I like this question a lot, though. I keep thinking about it

Yes, they seem to be linked together. Well, some experts believe that nostalgia is not the subtype of depression. Nostalgia often occurs when you think of people you love, both those you have never met and those you do not spend time with therapies. And medication can help you to deal with this situation.

Title: My girlfriend is in a really bad place. How do I support her?
Thread
Dear all I think my girlfriend is not well and I try to support her but ink what to do next. But let me start at the beginning we fight from time to time, have discussions and often time both make a bigger deal out of somthing that seems arbitrary from the outside I guess that can happen in a relationship recently, it changed, though after a big fight a few weeks ago, my girlfriend confusion started crying endlessly. It was intense. She could not almost breath and was not able to calm down. I switched gears completely from somebody who was discussing her to somebody who wanted to support her. She did not calm down for a long time, but eventually she made it the next day she said she has to look into what that really meant. And I agree it went a bit better. Then everything kind of went back to normal, and I thought that was it normally she was responding with a lot of smiles and laughter, but recently she became very silent, so silent that I asked her what is up? And the exact same crying started again. Almost no air, uncontrolled emotions, not a good time. This time, there was not a fight going on, though to me, it seemed like it was out of thin air. So I asked her if there is anything I can do to support her. And I ask what was up if she wanted to talk? She did not say something for anHour or so. But as I felt helpless, I really did want to know what is up after that very long hour? She said, I feel trapped with you, with my job, with my friends, with my family. And I was taken aback a bit, because, yeah, I know not everything is fine in our relationship, but I felt like, generally, we are on a good path and also job, family, friends, those are the things that define her. What left those things is everything she values. And I asked her if she wanted to seek professional help, which she answered with a relatively silent. Yes. One day later, I asked her if she wanted to talk about what has happened yesterday, and if she has made an appointment already, she said no to both, and started crying furiously again. She did not reply to me and said, I should stop asking her questions, which I did, but she was crying minutes, and when I said, I only want to understand you better, she said, you blame me for not sharing. I said, I am not blaming you at all. I just want to understand you. And she said, but it feels that way. So I shut up again and another half an hour of crying at this point, I became desperate because I felt like we are leaving the grey area in to a full blown emergency. I asked her if I should call one of her friends or family or even the ambulance, andShe said no, very intensively. So I was silent again and just sat next to her. Then she wanted to take a shower but needed like minutes to undress. I knocked, asked what she is doing, tried to assure that we are on the same team. And despite not knowing what she is going through, I am always there to help. But she distrusts me and does not open up. She kept crying, and I left the shower to give her space so that where we are standing, I am pretty clueless about what is going on and how to support her. Also, I do not want to talk to friends or family, despite having a lot of people around me who are seeking help with a therapist, but I want to protect her interests and keep it private. So that is how I ended up here because I desperately need some input. Apparently, she asked her friend on the weekend for a therapists number, but has not called yet.

Do not push the matter, but be sure you are the guy at her side to provide fully to cover her basic needs shelter, food, quite safe, warm space for her to sleep, make her tea or coffee in the morning. When she wakes up, look for professional help via ambulance. If need be, do you have a general therapist she attends for your regular checkups start there. The long crying episodes could be something close to a panic attack. Again, a professional should evaluate this the sooner the better you have to understand that there is nothing you can quickly change in the way she precepts the world. So try to be the best caretaker you can

I may not be the best qualified to give advice on this matter, but as someone who had and still has to go through something like this, I say, talk less and do more for the time being it seems as if she is just not willing to talk, and the more you push it, the more she will push you away. I say, just be there for her and give her whatever she needs but do not try and talk about it. As of right now, professional insight is of utmost importance right now. I know that feeling of helplessness very well but try and focus on her and what she might need let her walk towards where she needs to go but make sure to keep an eye on her to make sure things do not get any worse. I hope things get better for the both of you

I would suggest giving her time and space don pry too much about it if she is not ready to talk about it then it is just going to upset her even more when I say space I mean do not be the helicopter boyfriend you can still be there for her though maybe try a date night or see if she would like to go hang out with her friends it definitely sounds like she is extremely overwhelmed so if there is any way you could help alleviate her work load might help also if you want her to do counseling I suggest doing it to she might see you doing it and realize hey that does not seem so bad after all especially if you are showing improvement yourself that about the best advice I got for you good luck and I hope things improve

Yep. Except I cannot bring myself brush my teeth of the time. I do not even really wake up and eat, I am trying to lose weight, so I try and fast during the day, when I do not have an appetite, but a lot of the time I give in to binge eating, not because of fasting. The fasting is because I know I will always want to binge eatconfusion. My depression is at its worst right now, cause I am unemployed and broke, so I am stressed to the max.

I know so damn well how you feel. I have felt like this cyclically for more than years. Now, when I get in a negative loop, what I usually do is to literally force myself to get dressed and get out of my house like it is on fire, and I need to get out. Have some sun on me. Have a walk in the nature or also forcing myself to go to the gym. You would not believe how beneficial that is. It can severely improve your mood in a matter of minutes.

Im a nail tech in trainingconfusion, and even then all I see when I look at my work is the horrible, ugly side. So I am working almost all the time, but that is the only place I am productive. My personal life is a mess. My room is disgusting and full of trash. I binge eat and barely sleep. I just shower, so I do not stink at work. And even then, I wear the same gross clothes all the time. I have covered all the mirrors in my room, and I do not talk to anyone anymore. My routine is wake up, work, home, eat, cry myself to sleep. I ask this because I feel so many people have more reasons to be depressed than me, and that makes me feel guilty for feeling how I feel

I do not feel good. I go in public and I post on socials and I talk to people, and I pretend I am okay, but I am not. I have to pretend I am okay, because every time I let it show that I am hurting, people cut me off and ignore me. You can talk to me the next time it gets bad, they say not meaning a word. People only want to talk about themselves. I do not blame them. I feel the same, which is why I try so hard to be a good listener. No one would want to talk to me at all if they knew how bad it was. No one wants to hear it. I do not know what to do. I do not want to be alone, but it feels so lonely to keep everything inside

Ive never posted on here before, but I feel it is time, and im hoping someone sees this that can relate or has good non judgmental advice. Im scared of life and scared of being an adult. Im extremely codependent, and I have horrible depression and anxiety. My brain is trying to convince me to not be here anymore because of my fears for the future. Ill go into more detail if I can find someone to talk to.

I hope you are okay. It probably worth knowing that you are not alone, although most people hide it pretty well. We are all a bit lost. If I can offer any advice, I would say, try to incorporate more nature into your life gardening, walking on the beach hills, even just buying yourself a plant and looking after it will bring you some calmness. Take it one day at a time and do not put too much pressure on yourself. You will be okay. Good luck.

I am going through the exact same situation you are, so I cannot give you the advice you need. All I can say is you are not alone. Depression keeps me unmotivated every day, so it is hard to improve myself and I live with my family who constantly nag at me for not having my shit together. I am so not ready for adulthood and I am bout be just like you. I fear for my future woozy face.

I have a whole month of unverified absences, and my teachers have been emailing me. I have not responded to any of them because I do not know what to tell them. I used to be a straight a student who would take the most rigorous classes. All my grades are falling, and I am failing in most of my classes. Now, my mom is disappointed in me. I stay in my room all day, but the walls are thin, so I can hear her yelling in the morning. She tells my family how I am useless and of no help. I know my siblings agree, and my older brother constantly tells me how I am a leech. I know I am a burden to them, but I have not done anything to change that. I have stopped talking to my friends, even though I want to see them. They send me messages, but I am inconsistent and go for days before I can muster a reply to them. I know I have dug myself into a hole, but I do not know when I am supposed to get out of it. I do not want to do the work for school. I do not want to get out of bed. I do not want to try at all. I have stopped taking care of my hygiene, and my mom has called me disgusting for it. I have stopped bothering to go to the kitchen to eat. I do not have a passion for anything. AndI cannot enjoy doing the things I used to enjoy anymore. I just cannot see a future where I am happy.

I am so heart broken of what you described yet wanting you to know you are not a burden. They are toxic bunch who have no idea what they are on about what human emotions are and what love is no one should say such things to anyone. Now the hole you are in can be climbed back up to the surface. You just need help and to ignore what your family says. Oh my, the damage that is causing you. I hate such people. I am sorry for saying that I have lived with such and still am for all my life and it is toxic. Now, let us figure out what did you use to enjoy in the past in terms of hobbies? Why do you not go out? Why do you not text friends you had or if it will make it easier? What are the obstacles in your life that you cannot win yet want in order to change your current situation in life?

Try working on the most basic function hygiene to get anywhere from this hole you are in, is to feel better about yourself. You need the comfort of a shower, the feeling of brushing your teeth, your hair, looking at yourself in the mirror every journey has a beginning.

I hope you get well, I know very well how hard it is to do anything at times like this, and I do not know what you have tried, but this is advice for anyone in your situation. Please see a doctor. You have symptoms of acute depression, and while this is not a diagnosis, you should get one not to mention that depression can also be a symptom in some other conditions. It is also a disease that has cures or at least medications that can help. In short, please ask to see a doctor in your case. Op, you should maybe tell your family that you need a doctor for something physical, since otherwise, they may not take you seriously once you get there, tell them all of this and any other symptoms you may have. I wish you luck.

Title: Confusion I fucked up my life.
Thread
I here I moved across the country to wyoming, from florida with my boyfriend, confusion, who I was not even with for a year yet stupid. I know I quit my job that I loved. I left the place I called home and had hopes for a clean slate in a new state. Things are not going smoothly. Its the total opposite of what I expected. Sexual issues. Communication has gotten the worst it is ever been minor, but continuous lies from my boyfriend, which he told me he would be better about lack of trust in him due to his lies baggage on his end, causing major strain between the two of us mother in law, exesconfusion. I made sure to not bring any baggage here on my end, since I quit my well paying job in florida to come here. My credit cards have not gotten paid since november and my bank account is, he told me he was going to take care of me financially. He hasnt. I lived alone with my dog and guinea pigs back in florida for years before I met my current boyfriend. I was stable in nearly every sense. I was happier. My moods and feelings were not reliant upon some guy I was in control of my own moods and emotions. I miss that so much. I miss my little overpriced bed bath apartment back in florida that I had to myself. What am I doing with my life now I threw away everything I valued andLoved about my life for some guy that cannot even be honest with me on a consistent basis for a guy that needs to be trained and told like a dog how to be romantic for me for a guy who just does not understand me, even though he likes to act like he does, I am so stupid. God, I am so stupid. And you want to know what the worst part is. I do not think I can get that blissful life I had before him back. I make a month now I am not only broke I am in severe debt now things will never be the same because of my decisions. I hate myself, and I wish my overdose actually worked back when I was. I guess I cannot even do that, right? I am quite literally good for nothing. I should have done better for myself than this. I know better. I let my heart decide for me. I do not even know where to start to rebuild from this chaos I made for myself. I put myself in a situation that feels impossible to get out of. I cannot even be mad at him. I did it to myself.

Could you get help to move back to florida or maybe temporarily get help from your family you are and probably have a long life ahead of you. It ok to mess up sounds like the first thing you need to do is get back to florida. I do not know how you raise the money, but to me that is your first step. I hope you can go easier on yourself breath. I know it is easy for me to say this when I am not in your situation. I do know that beating yourself up over this is not going to get you close to solving your problem

I am sorry you are going through this. Depression can really suck, especially when you have no one around you who is on your side. Do you have any good friends or family that you can stay with a few days or even a day or two? It can be a wonder how much the people around you can affect your mental health sometimes, and maybe you might see an improvement in your mental health. I also. Second, what another commenter recommended about seeing a doctor asap depression can sometimes be caused by other underlying problems, and it would be good to rule that out. Also, getting a diagnosis and referral from your go is important for getting the help you need by mental health professionals. Just say you feel sick to your mother and would like to go to the doctor, technically not lyingconfusion, and you can open up to them there in privacy, if need be. In addition, I recommend emailing your guidance counselor explaining what is going on. Maybe even try for a doctors note. If possible ink schools do not want their students to fail, and you might be able to work something out. Even so, grades are not everything your life is not ruined. For the time being, I recommend doing something anythingconfusion. That makes you feel even slightly better, whether it be a hot shower or even just washing your hair in the sinkconfusion, drinking, a hot drink, doing a color by number, word search, etc. Clean a small areaOf your room, drink water, sit in the sun for a bit, even if it is in front of a windowconfusion. Literally anything, even if it is just one thing, it is a reason to feel proud of yourself. You deserve to be happy.

Yeah, I know its stupid to suicide because people think having suicidal thoughts is just a way to attract some attention. And thats what an adult said to me in the end, the only one who can save me is me. Why adult always think they know everything to us kid do they know I been thinking about getting suicide? Do they know I already tried to kill myself each night they always act like they know the best of me when they didnt know im suffering from their own words. I hate adults not all adults, but I hate adult who compare themselves to us and give a toxic advices like why ard you getting lazy about? Its just a depress your just a kid. You dont have a problem since you only a kid. Why are you worrying about when you dont work? You just need to study why it is so hard. And many more I didnt wish to be born in this fucking world.

Sometimes different generations just have such a big disconnect. They do not understand the feelings of other generations and act like they have never ever felt similarly in their lives. I do not think it is usually out of malice as much as it is misunderstanding. Like you said, sometimes they just expect us to be all happy and fine, just because we are young and do not have as much live experience as they do. Some of them just do not understand what it is like to be a kid in this generation, like we will never understand being a kid in theirsconfusion that why it can be so harmful to compare lives. Things have changed so much over the past decades, and some of them cannot seem to understand that. I know life can be really hard, but please do not resort to suicide. You may be going through a rough spot in your life, but that is not all. Life is. Sometimes it seems like when we are in a dark spot, nothing can get better. We cannot just commit suicide because something is not going the way we want it to, not downplaying your situation in any wayconfusion, it really is a long term solution to a short term problem, and it hurts others around you so much if you really feel this way, please reach out to someone in your life, anyone close to you that will listen. No one should ever have to be alone.

I have dealt with many heartbreaks caused by infidelity. And now I have almost all kinds of mental issues that is there. I usually have extremely violent thoughts. I cry out of nowhere. I do not shower. Often, I do not feel hungry. I am stuck in this four walled room, and I have no motivation to do anything. I am just too sad to move.

I do not feel good. I go in public and I post on socials and I talk to people, and I pretend I am okay, but I am not. I have to pretend I am okay, because every time I let it show that I am hurting, people cut me off and ignore me. You can talk to me the next time it gets bad, they say not meaning a word. People only want to talk about themselves. I do not blame them. I feel the same, which is why I try so hard to be a good listener. No one would want to talk to me at all if they knew how bad it was. No one wants to hear it. I do not know what to do. I do not want to be alone, but it feels so lonely to keep everything inside

Maybe my expectations on life are too high. That is why I am constantly disappointed. Maybe I do not have enough good friends, maybe because I am separated from my parents. They are in a different country, and I have not been able to visit in yearsconfusion. Its real. But I do not know why

Depression does not really need a reason to exist, but it feeds on all the negative and sad things you experience or feel. Does your therapist ask you questions that would make you think deeper on your issues? Or is it something you never have wanted to do when you say you feel detached? Is there something that would make you feel more present in the moment?

Title: Is it common for those with severe depression to disappear? Ghost friends when under stress.
Thread
My roommate has severe depression, and last night, an issue came up with work that upset her alot, and she wants to head home from the resort area we work at. We were all going to go get food today, but she decided to cancel. And then when everyone wanted to be there to support her, she left our group chat. Now, of course, we are adults, so we are not going to chase her cus. That is not fair to anyone. If she wants to head home and not go get food, that is her choice. No matter how much we want her to, no one can force her

I have seen this happen with friends before, even to the point where an online friend will disappear for months and then pop by with a shy hello. I have talked with some friends about this before, and it is like they can get overwhelmed and then they feel embarrassed about it, and therefore do not reach out. I have found the best thing to do is kind of gently check on them after a while and do not make a big deal out of them disappearing. I have used this method many times, and you can tell the relief if you are close enough to this friend, maybe give that a shot

I have done this to friends before as a form of self sabotage. I desperately wanted to end it all but had not hit whatever breaking point might let me do it. So I started removing people from my life through ghosting them or treating them like shit. I would tell myself that I was doing it for their own good. I am a toxic person. They will be better off without me dragging them down. And if I did end things, I would be protecting them from pain and guilt. Really, I was trying to make my life worse and worse, cutting out friends and loved ones who might help me I permanently destroyed relationships, lost. Best friends, one who will not talk to me to this day, and I do not blame him. I have no advice for you. Your friend is hurting and you may or may not be able to help her. You should try, but not everyone is ready for help.

Title: I feel pain when I am sober.
Thread
I feel pain when I am drunk, too. But it is a different kind of pain when I am sober, because I am forced to confront the fact that this is my reality. This is my default state, when no other substances are affecting me. Emotional pain is worse than physical pain for me, and just knowing that my default state is constant, pain fucks with me to no end. I wish it was like stubbing your toe, because at least I know the exact cause, and eventually the pain will subside. But this shit is so much worse. I feel it all over my body. Its like gravity is working twice as hard like an invisible force is crushing me from all directions. Being sober is pain
Comments
As humans feeling pain is your brain giving you a warning. Something is wrong drugs, alcohol, etc. Are not natural to your brain, and you get mixed signals of warnings. You have to chose to continue allowing these substances to fool your brain or stop, feel real pain, your aliveconfusion, and get help to get better and support, or just sit in your shit and not get better hugs.

Welcome to adulthood. My man, you need to prioritize your problem and fix them asap. As an adult, problems will continue to happen. You have to prepare the unexpected, so you dont fall into where your at. Now I get that you have a lot on your plate, but that is exactly why you need to get your priorities in check. You re in debt, got in a wreck, and your girl has issues. You need to handle the car wreck first, because you got other pal involved. Things will only get worst if you choose to do nothing. It is overwhelming. You all have to sacrifice certain things in order to get other things in order. It may feel like you are alone, and a part of it is true because you got to take care of yourself and your own problems. It no one else problem to take care of you. Dude. Remember, you got to do something about your problems, handle them one by one, even if you are mentally stress, you just got to pull through. This is what it is meant by being an adult and taking care of your business.

Hi years. With those symptoms you will make it you can actually stay in bed all day saturday and watch youtube and make a good living on the other days even lie in a chair all day saturday and measure time by the number times you have to get up to piss even not want to get up to piss while you toy around the idea of bringing a piss bottle near the chair maybe this will work focus on what is right in front of you or in just a few hours ahead instead of the big picture dont make big plans and watch youtube stuff that you used to be interested in rather than cat or asmr videos also consider that by staying in bed you are becoming even more depressed because you are unhappy that you are staying in bed. You used to be high functioning after all see where that is going.

I started a second full time job on monday because im moving for school in the fall, and it is extra money. It is making me so stressed. I feel like I cannot remember anything. Im also so slow at it compared to everyone else, and I feel so out of place. And like an annoyance, I barely know what im doing, and when I get home, I just want to complain about my day. But when I do my parents get mad and just tell me to quit or that I will not get far in life, or I should just give up everything and work at my first job for the rest of my life. Gas stationconfusion. I took years off of school, and they hated that, so I guess they do not believe I have potential. When I go back this year idkconfusion, like, I just want to complain about the shit day I had, because it makes me feel better, but them saying that just makes it worse. But I feel like I cannot quit, even if im miserable, because I feel guilty about everything. And I need money. I am not being dramatic. When I say, I have no friends. I literally dont. I had a boyfriend for years, and he was my best friend, and we talked about getting married. Then one day he was done and blocked me. This was months ago, absolutely broke me. After that, I rekindled my friendship with my guy, best friend and a fewMonths later, he blocked me too, not because of a girlfriend. I honestly do not know whyconfusion. So I have no friends to talk to or boyfriend, and I just feel so lonely and alone, and my own parents do not even have my back. Is something wrong with me? Why do not people like me? Im not a rude person. Im kind and caring, etc. I am on different meds, and I do not think they are working anymore, and im just tired of everything.

I am about to turn, and I feel like I have done nothing with my life. Moved back home from the city after trying to show my family how I was going to try and make something of myself and actually work on. Having a good future ended up moving back after I ran from an abusive relationship that left me in worth of debt. All my family are off doing their own things. Since I got back. My siblings are all now married with kids, big, well paid jobs and their own houses. I have no friends, no degrees or major qualifications kind of just went from job to job. I am still living at home with my parents, no savings, no plans for my future. Guess, I just do not really have anyone that I can relate to become friends with, etc. Just wondered, does anyone else feel like they have just wasted their life and look back thinking of all the things they could have done better. I kind of want to just pack a bag, change my name, move away and start a fresh. I am getting so tired of the feeling that I have achieved compared to my siblings and other family.

On top of this, all my friends have moved on, and I do not have any real strong connections with anyone or anything. I honestly feel like I am wasting my life away, and everyday I get more or more depressed.

Your whole life is still ahead of you man you should definitely finish your degree and when you do celebrate it somehow things like that need closing and even if your degree feels worthless it really does give you something for the future that you might not even realize dont compare your journey or the rhythm of it to others I do it myself too and it has never helped. Im years older than you and slowly starting to realise what I want from life.

I think I got to the lowest point in my life. I started a masters degree, which I am going to quit. I have a severe social anxiety, almost no friends and have never been in a relationship. I do not enjoy anything, and I do not see anything worth living for. I have been going to therapy for more than a year, but it does not seem to help. I know and understand what I should do to feel better, which thoughts and beliefs I got to change. But I just feel that my brain is fucked up and cannot be fixed. I want to have close relationships really bad, but I feel uncomfortable around people. I feel awkward and unlovable deep inside me. I know have good qualities. I know I have the potential to be happy, and I have memories where I was happy and had an impact on others, but I am so far from where I want to be, and I feel like I do not have the power to fight anymore for living a better life. I feel like even my therapist and my mother gave up. The only reason I still live is because I do not want my mother to be sad, but I feel like my existence is not important to anyone, and people will forget me very quickly.

You get out of therapy what you put into it and it is mostly hard work or neutral ish sessions for like a while before you have a breakthru. Whoever you found wouldnt have contemplated suicide because of something you did. They would have already had to have felt pretty awful on their own. That isnt your fault.

It ok to talk about it if it is an everyday thing, then maybe you need to either learn to deal or remove the person from your life if it is a big deal this makes me think of the term it is what it is not what it should be I thought said person would do something a certain way but they didn you are disappointed why do you think they would act that way or do that thing you wanted them to it something as simple as oh, I did not ask for ketchup on my burger and then you get super butthurt and angry about it. People make mistakes, treat people like a human being. You make mistakes, other people make mistakes some make bigger or smaller mistakes based on our perception of reality, like if someone is hitting you, fuck that shit, get out of that situation, pronto, but yea learn to keep your emotions. I check, though, that where you start making dumb decisions, it ok to get mad, it not ok to get mad and get in a fist fight at work and lose your job and go to jail and pay for damaged, etc. That is just cents person shrugging.

I am sorry you are going through this. Anxiety and depression can be so debilitating sleep and nutrition are powerful weapons in your battle. Your condition is likely made worse by the lack of nutrients. Whats stopping you from eating? The effort to make something cleaning up nothing sounds good.

I eat because I know it helps me not die. But in reality, I have not felt actual hunger and actual fullness in months.

Sometimes I get caught in these rumination traps, and I cannot stop thinking it is a steady stream for hours and hours and hours. The only thing that has worked for me is to stop resisting the thoughts and just let them coast. Eventually that can break the cycle. I go for a walk and just let myself go. Hasn happened in a few weeks, which is nice, definitely a shortage of therapists out there.

I am not sad. In the normal sense. I am just tired. I will not hurt myself because I am trapped in empathy and people and love will suffer. But I feel one of my fundamental rights is peer pressured away from me. I am diagnosed healthy. Maybe I am too big a philosophy nerd. But in the grand scheme of life, it seems the only thing under my control is if I keep breathing, but with external pressure, it just isnt. Why cannot society admit that?

Our society is very hypocritical in the fact that they say they want to help us get better but at the same time put an immense amount of stress on us to excel and focus on society as a whole its very difficult for many western societies to see that most peoples ability to continue going on is not based upon how their success and ability, but rather the ones they are surrounded by. Those who are the happiest in their lives are the ones who have the most people they care about that are not built in ie family. The fulfillment you get by forging power relationships is the greatest remedy for a loss of motivation. My suggestion is that you seek out the people who love you and hold onto them. We only live one life and it is a cold world. No one should be alone

I do not see anything wrong with it. The same losers who say your life is precious are the same people who would go running for the hills. If you called them to vent. When I see my friends having babies, I cannot help but to resent them, like, why would you bring another human into this world knowing how dark and cruel it is?

I believe that your feelings were always there, and you were using juuling as a coping mechanism of sorts. It is important to remember that vaping and smoking are incredibly similar in the fact that a stressed, older business owner might smoke a cigarette to calm down. And a younger person may vape to distract themselves. I admire what you are doing in quitting, but I would suggest seeking out a support system from someone you really trust to talk about how you are feeling. Another good idea is to find an alternative to vaping like a healthy hobby. Ie, going to the gym, volunteering, working on your career, etc. Just know that you are not alone, and you can do anything, as you believe in yourself.

It could have. It does give you dopamine as for withdrawal. I stopped smoking two times in my life for about months each. I have gone back to it because I like the habit. The only withdrawal I felt was a state of restlessness that lasted days or so. It does not even come close with benzodiazepine withdrawal. I had panic attacks and seizures from that one and insomnia that lasted weeks. I also notice that in the morning, when my body does not have any nicotine left, if I go and smoke or vape, I feel a little bit of pleasure inside my body and a calming sensation

I know life sucks sometimes, and yes, for a lot of people, not just yourselves all of the time. I was diagnosed with prostate cancer in november and not early stages. I knew because of my mum to just keep going to appointments. But it did not change the way I felt. I was scared, depressed, anxious and still get very anxious and nervous before an appointment. But you know what kept me going? All the people that gave me hell through the year and treated me like crap. I said to myself, you know what? These people tried to drag me down and make me feel worthless? Well, I am my own person, nobody, and I mean, nobody can take that away from me. So I did something I would never done before, and I am a year old bloke. I got a pedicure and a manicure. I got some strange looks, and women giggling at me, but I just smiled and laughed back. It was great to smile and laugh, find something you would not normally do. It could be anything, and do it. I have been finding silly little things for the past couple of months and taking pictures, and it makes you laugh. If someone does not like it. Oh, well, stuff them. It is your life and you are going to do and be who you want to be, not who they want you to be. It is your life not theirs. I hope some people take this into consideration becauseDoing something different in your life can make a world of difference, love and peace to you all.

I miss him, but not like when I could see him. I want to hear him call me his little crow again. I want to hear his voice as I fall asleep on discord. I want him to compliment my laugh, my singing voice and how pretty I am. I want him to put his hand on my face as the tears roll down my cheeks him hug me and squeeze me tight and keep it simple, stupid me. He not gone forever. It just feels like it. I help him through the day and you took that away from him. You cruel lady, he is hurting. He hurt himself and you will not allow him to talk to his only source of happiness. Why did you take him away? He loves me and I love him. I not like her and I never will be. He treats me like I loved and that I deserve it. Let him be free, please. I want to hear him fall asleep and tell me all the ways he would cuddle me. I know we are young, but it is love. And this time, I not dumb about it. I know he loves me and he is trying. Let him try that all I ask. Let him free and try. I know he will not forget me, and you cannot make him. I will stick by his side till I can see him again, and you cannot change my views. I am the only person he trusts right now.Because you betrayed him and he is now hurting. Thank you for listening to me rant and being the best, even when we were friends.

So young you got so much time. Shit may seem wack right now, but my suggestion is you try to find something you are passionate about and stick with it. As you get older, you will realize more and more how dumb some early relationships were focus on yourself.

Title: I do not know how to deal with this loneliness.
Thread
This loneliness is killing me from inside. Most people around me seems to be doing fine socially except myself. It makes me feeling more and more depressed whenever a guy or girl around me opened up their phones and have, like, tons of messages from their friends awaiting for them to check and reply while I got none throughout a day or even few days, it is like no one like me and want to chat with me. All I want is to feel like I actually matter to someone that they will actively want to chat with me and I want to feel loved by someone just like how I would love them. I never have a partner. And seeing people getting hugged by their love one just makes me want to cry when I am alone in night. I really do not know what is wrong with me so that no one seems want me in their life.

But I remember my dad used to bring me home food from his job to make me feel better and now that he is gone, I do not really know what to do or how to talk to people about how I am feeling. I have thought about taking my own life a few times over the year, but ink why I have not done something like that yet. I just wish I had someone to talk to. I just feel very much alone in the world, and I am going to lie anymore. I have been relapsing the past couple days with self harm, like cutting my arms up. The pain just relieves all the mental strain I have been living with recently. I just want it to end

It may seem like a lot right now, but with time you will get better as for your situation, I would say, try your best to find some kind of job, anything at all. Having somewhere to go while making money and meeting new people can be fulfilling and can help immensely. And if you really need someone to talk to, there are free anonymous chat site online where you can talk to a real person.

In many ways, I feel the same way it been about years or so of me being single. And although it is gotten easier, I cannot promise that to you, nor would it be a reasonable promise to make. I do hear you, though. And it is hard to find yourself when you feel lost. Truth be told, though my biggest strength now is that I more or less date myself. If I cannot find the validation for myself externally, then you have to reach inside to find that validation yourself. It not easy, though, but it is possible. Give it a try. Sometime you may not get it right the first time, but keep at it like any relationship. It takes time, patience and diligence, but you will find it. And once you do, you all notice that maybe your the person someone else is looking for, not the other way around

What danielle was very well said, I just happened to talk with my friend today about self confidence. And we both think how it is funny when we were singles, no one gave a shit. But then when we got girls suddenly other girls were interested in us, and that is mostly because we are self confident in our healthy relationships, so it glows from us. It would be worth the effort to try to be in a relationship with yourself. Talk to your inner self the way you would talk to your loved one.

Just want to say that your amazing for braving on this long. I cannot imagine what it is like for you to struggle like this. You seem like a super nice person, and I want to see you succeed in whatever you do have you tried talking to a therapist or a counselor. I am sure that they could assist you with what is going on. But im not sure how that works over there. Since I am from the united states. Also, I really recommend that if you ever get to a point where you might try to end your life, please give the suicide lifeline a call. I have used a hotline twice, and I have met incredible people with incredible stories to tell you can even call them when your just having a really bad time. The hotlines arent necessarily there to solve your problems, because in most cases, they cantconfusion but they are there to get you through your hard moments. You are not alone in the way that you feel, and I would love to see you grow and succeed.

Title: Endless loop.
Thread
I feel like my life is basically one giant loop of depression and always has been when I was younger, I was very young, I always had immense difficulties, befriending, or even connecting with anyone at all. Through elementary school, I did not have a single friend and spent basically ever second alone. I tried to connect with people, anyone, but they always brushed me off. Even when I tried my best. I got involved with so many different things, including baseball, lacrosse and programming. But ever, single one of those ended in exclusion. Even when I tried my best. Moving on to middle school, it only got worse. I had a few friends, but I was constantly bullied and made fun of for everything from the way I dressed to the way I talked. But in middle school, I never gave up and held my ground in everything. I was certainly not happy, but I was not depressed. Moving onto high school, things seemed to look up. I met a bunch of guys who ended up being my close friends then. But as time moved on, everyone would move away from me, and I was left alone again. I did make my fair share of stupid moves which harmed my friendships, but I never was good at really mending anything with anyone. So the end of high school comes around, and all my old friends ditch me and do not want anything to do with me. I was excluded from so many sleepovers, hangouts andWas treated so poorly every time I tried to make plans, I was brushed aside and they went on without me I think that was when I first realized I may have depression. I must note that throughout all of these years I was taking various medications to help me cope with adhd and the side effects were always awful. Ie making me super quiet and amplifying my anxiety anyways came around and the pandemic happened, which only made everything worse for me since I was stuck at home like everyone else. This is when the loneliness really started to pickup. I thought maybe trying to have an actual serious relationship with someone would help me so I tried to find a girlfriend, and I did. I met this amazing girl who went to a school by me named abby. She was an amazing girl and always went out of her way to make me happy. But as college approached and we were going to schools that were on opposite sides of the country, I decided it was best for the both of us to move on, we tried to remain friends, but after awhile, everything just drifted apart. Now onto my college experience so far, I am studying industrial engineering and computer science at a school in pa, and the first semester was actually really good. I met so many people who held similar interests as me and we all would always hangout. But by second semester, everyone had already shifted and found their groupsClose friends drifted as they joined fraternities, and others became closer because of classes. I was basically left alone, and my attempts to connect with these people only ended in failure. I just get the feeling I am not a likable person, but it is so hard to always be outgoing when your mind is constantly telling you everything you do is wrong. Second year has not been much better so far either. I got a roommate but he was worse than I was in terms of the depression department, and he only made things worse for me to no fault of his own. I also met an amazing girl who basically made my first semester and year here amazing. She would always treat me so nicely and be with me and care about my feelings. I actually started to feel better about myself only for her to drift away from me slowly because of her commitment issues. We tried to stay friends, but every time I asked to do something, she would make up an excuse. Every time I tried to be nice to her, she just threw how I felt aside that hurt more than anything else and completely destroyed my trust in anyone. So now I am currently living alone, posting this on a thursday night with no plans to go out partying because no one has invited me anywhere. As you could probably tell from my post, it seems that every time something good comes into my life, it inevitably is rippedAway from me, and I am left back at square one. I do not want to feel this alone anymore, and I just want to be a normal year old with friends, good grades and a bright future. But it just hurts so much. I have tried therapists and different anti anxiety meds, but nothing has ever worked. I am seriously at my wits end right now and truly would appreciate any advice. Anyone could send my way. Thank you.

I have a severe depression since I take anxiolytics and antidepressants, I have agoraphobia. And now I started, month ago to have dissociative disorders that all doctors and therapists seem to give a shit about it. I do not have any official diagnostic or help with all of this shit. My mom try to help me, but it does not work at all. I hate being a human. I hate this world, this society, and I hate the billion people on this earth. I wish I was never born. I do not want to exist.

Title: What I go through everyday.
Thread
Imagine having thoughts telling you are a horrible person that is not worthy of anything in life and that you deserve everything bad to happen to you because of what you did in the past. Sometimes you have moments of clarity once in a while, but depending on the day, they are few and far between ever read self help articles asked for advice, but never actually incorporating it, because, you know, you just snap back in a few days after months years of doing what you heard in those articles, and then it is time for school for the whole day. You are dreading being here, trying to keep that mask on both literally and figurativelyconfusion most of the time trying to repress those thoughts again. There are those few good days opportunities for the mind to wander, thinking of what you would bring into this world. But then it all comes crashing down. Amp the thoughts are more vile, harsh and critical, and you are on the verge of spontaneously crying, fights, breaking out, puts the question in your mintongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. What if I was in that situation? You be worse? Way worse? The answer is then repressed, and you move on with the day until it is time to go home. God, I so tired

Finding little things helped me in my darkest time. I would go out almost every night, lay on my back and stare at the sky, just letting my mind wander ink. That kind of put things in perspective for me. After a little while, I looked forward to the stargazing and found myself pushing through hard things just so I could look at the stars one more night. Theres a built in karma to this world. Those suffering now will have happy times later. And same goes the other way around. I know there is not much anyone can say to fix these feelings. Lol, but for me, it always helped hearing how others handle it. Happy face or smiley

Title: I am a loser.
Thread
Recently, life has been really shitty for me. I mess up more often than I usually do, which sucks. I have this problem. I am desperate for validation from others, more specifically, my classmates. I care a lot what others think about me. And that sucks, since the tiniest tease or insult from my friends can ruin my entire day. I wish I was different. I wish people did not see me as a sorta easy target to insult. And worst of all, I am jelous on the person that insults me the most everyone just likes him. For some reason. He is more smart, gets along with more people, but he is also kind of similar to me. We both have a similar sense of humor, and we are both kind of introverted and quiet. He might be even more than I amconfusion. I would not call him a bully since we get along really well sometimes, but it is just certain moments where I hate the world because of him. I am really lost and confused, and I wish people would just give me more positive attention. Ik that sounds really egotistical, but that is really what I want. I do not want to waste my teen years being depressed and sad all the time. So I really want to get this fixed. Any advice is appreciated
Comments
Being egotistical is not a negative thing everyone is egotistical. So do not worry about that teen years can be problematic I experienced that if my experience can help you I tell you that my error was closing in myself and not doing nothing even cultivate my interests. Give more attention to yourself it is difficult but not impossible. Dedicate more time to your hobbies it could help you to grow your character and also a distraction from bad thoughts and another surely banal sorryconfusion suggestion you are still young many things can happen in time do not lose hope you are not a loser. If you want to talk, I am here and remember we love you

Title: I just wanted to vent.
Thread
I am year old boy from slovakian and I am studying on secondary medical school it year main reason of writing this is because I have a big suspicion that I have a depression and I currently feel like a shit I have add and a mild asperger syndrome so I visit a psychiatrist like once a year I will tell her about this on the next session on the start of this school year I was pretty much ok I made some friends which is a miracle for me because I do not like to socialize much at least I though I made friends the girls soon started to avoid me but I was ok with that because I felt like they just need their privacy I am not going to bother them soon I started to have a crush on one of my classmates I managed to sit next to her and we started talking we had a similar hobbies and we were going to school together after a week when she was getting of a train, I hugged her. Then in the evening I received a message where she was asking if I like her or I made a bet with someone to hug her. I said I like her and I though that all was good. She started to avoid me. It lasted like a month until I texted her why was she doing this than we clarified things. She said that she wants to be only a friend. We were stillTravelling to school together after that, but we were more quiet and restrained in this same period. Something much worse happened. My roommate from dorms told us that he has some problems in familly and that he has to go to his grandparents. This holliday the next day I was talking to my classmates, I mentioned it. I do not remember why I was not making fun of him. I felt sorry for him. After I returned to dorms, I was confronted by my angry roommates. Thay told me that the whole school knows that he has the family problems and that I am making fun of him. I called my classmates the girls that I knew from the beggining and were avoiding me at the time and tried to explain the situation. They knew my roommate, and they were also angry at me. I lost my mind. I said, some fucked up shit to the mobile and hung up. I was desperate, because I did not know what exactly happened. I ran like a fucking kilometers. I did not know where I wanted to kill myself by jumping on the train tracks. I texted everyone from my class that all the things I said about him was false and tried to apologize to the roommate and the girls he forgave me, but the girls didn. I somehow went back to dorms, and the next day I tried to talk to them, but they ignored me. They only said that they do not want to seeMe ever again I met one of them when I was returning home the one I knew for the longest time we went to primary school togetherconfusion and she told me that she forgave me too for the next month I was not able to look into anyones eyes and I only talked to like people my crush and my other roommate not the one I betrayedconfusion sometimes to that girl that I know the longest time but I could not talk to her because her roommates hated me but my situation was getting better until I did other fuck up I lended my phone to my other roommate there are people in one room so it is a different person than the other guys I mentionedconfusion because he wanted to send one voice message to my class groupchat for fun but it went downhill he sended a lot more than one message and he offended a lot of people I tried to save the situation by saying that I did not know what happened, that he stole my mobile but it did not work. There was a total shitstorm in the school because of that I was a class president at the time and they wanted to kick me out of that position. So went to my teacher and told her that I no longer want to be a there and resigned she asked why so I told her that my class hate me on the next lesson she started to ask my classmates whatHappened it leaded to me almost having a mental breakdown and to me saying that I want to leave this school after that some people went like why would you leave or something similar this really helped me to overcome this thing and made me happier before I thought that everyone hated me and there is no place for me after I felt more comfortable and I managed to withstand the situation up until christmas holidays I was still depressed and it got worse during the holidays but after them I started to talk again with my crush I still like her and cannot get over itconfusion trough a game and it got better we were playing together often and I was happy again after a long time, we were texting and talking together almost every day for about a month but I saw that she is starting to lose interest and now she texts me back only like a once a day we both had couid last week and she still not quite ok at least what I know from her textsconfusion. So I thought it was because of that but she sends snaps and texts to other people I know normally she is now my only friend and im worried that I might lose that friendship. My depression got worse I feel like a shit every day. I told her about that, but not that it is because of her she tried to help me. She said that I should read some books andStuff that I currently cannot do because I have no energy. She did not text back since yesterday I asked her why, and if she still wants to be a friend, because the only time when we talk is when I ask her something or I start the conversation somehow. Now I am waiting for her to respond. I do not want a friendship where I am just the one that is bothering the other person with my crap. I do not want to be a dead weight for her, but I want someone to talk to. These are my biggest problems. Nowdays. My next problem is an antivaxx dad who is currently ill. So everyday now I have to listen to his conspiracy theories, racistic crap and shit like that, because he is constantly on a call with someone I sometimes wish I could be at the dorms. But then I remember that my roommates are fucking idiots. One is the guy I betrayed, and other is that guy I lended my mobile toconfusion, and I am losing my iq by living with them. The other roommates have the same problem. One of them started to lose it, too. He probably too, has some sort of a depression, because he sometimes randomly, starts to cry, and he told me he wanted to kill himself too. Almost every night, we are talking about our problems. We call it a deeptalk. He a good guy. He has a lot of friends, and almost every girl likes himYet he is often sad, but he wants to leave the dorms and move to another room or somewhere away from these idiots he will probably leave me with them. So that is all I dont care if anybody will read this. I just wanted to get this of me everyday. I feel like piece of shit and iwant to kill myself. So I hope this will help me at least a little

Title: I help everyone, but there is no one to help me. I am so tired.
Thread
I am the person everyone goes to. I look after my family, my friends, my coworkers, I help write cover letters, help people with their relationship problems, take care of people, taxes, look after their pets, etc. But I have no one who helps me with anything. I have severe depression. I normally have a handle on it by going to weekly therapy, exercising, sleeping enough, etc. But then couid happened. My therapist got couid, almost died, and then went into early retirement. She and I really got along, and she really helped me. I miss my sessions with her. I could not do tele therapy with a new person during couid cause. I have no privacy at my home. I stopped exercising and eating, right? My insomnia came back and I cannot sleep anymore, even with sleeping pills. My family and I do not get along because they are emotionally abusive. My best friend and I broke up right before couid. Then my boyfriend cheated on me and we broke up. My other best friend ended up having an affair with this guy, and he broke up with his fianc to be with her after being cheated on. I just could not really talk to that friend anymore, so I have no one to talk to now. But even before couid, when I had my two best friends and my ex in my life, I had no one to rely on the way people rely on me. No one helps me file taxes, no oneHelps me find jobs no one helps me clean my apartment I just wish I had someone to help me just for a little bit like help finding me a new therapist its so difficult finding someone new who takes your insurance is doing in person appointments is nearby your home or work is open during hours you are free and whose therapy style is a good fit for your personality situation I am so mentally emotionally and physically drained from my depression I can barely bring myself to eat or brush my teeth all my energy goes into keeping up appearances at work so I do not get fired I do not have any other energy to find a new therapist I want to move so I can get away from my family and have more privacy maybe then I can do tele therapy. But moving takes so much energy, time and money. I am so tired

My depression is at it worst when I am struggling with money, the constant anxiety of how I am going to juggle my bills the next month after having to pay for a car, repair the guilt I feel for not being able to visit or do anything for my brothers birthday next week. The shame I feel knowing that if something happens to my dogs, I am absolutely fucked because there is no way to pay for a vet bill. The stress of something going wrong with my car or my home is terrible, and I just cannot ever relax. When I at least know I will be able to pay the bills on time. I immediately feel so much better. I have thought hard about getting another part time job, but my full time job already drains all my energy and with depression to top it off, I do not know if it is even possible. I do not want to be rich. I just want to have enough to pay my bills and put a little extra away for emergencies, but I will never be able to with what I am currently earning and with how expensive the world is getting. I am so sick of being so stressed and scared and depressed over something so stupid as money. I know most everyone here probably understands or has at one point or another. It just sucks.

My best friend tried to commit suicide, and now they are in the hospital. I am worried about them, but I do not have any way of contacting them.

I do not know if their time at the hospital will even help, or if they will just go straight back to trying to kill themself. I do not know if I have lost the only person that genuinely made me feel supported and safe. The world feels like a cold place right now. I am sure there are other people who would care if they got to know me, but I am too much of a mess right now to ask someone, bridge that chasm.

You still do not know what your friend thinks you can stick around. I guess they will need you just will not admit they pushed you away because that is what usually people do before offing oneself.

So I do not even know where I am going with this. I was supposed to have a therapy session earlier today, but I slept through it after getting so stoned last night, I barely knew my name. I would like to say, I am surprised, but I really aint. I live the life of the unreliable, lazy and selfish older brother. I consistently stay up all night not due to struggling to fall asleep or anxieties about the next day or something reasonable or excusable. I just sit there at my computer, playing video games or watching youtube or reading anything that can distract me from actually thinking or feeling my relationships with friends and family, my uni attendance and work ethic, my ability to feel anything but paranoia, sadness and sorry for myself all falling apart. I just wish there was a restart button, and I am crying as I type this, all the answers are there. I have heard them for years from my dad, my friends, and now my therapist go outside, get some exercise, eat, healthy sleep. I cant. Why cannot I just change

Title: Not sure what to do anymore.
Thread
I am been struggling with chronic depression all my life, but it is only the past years that I have stopped laughing it off as, ha yeah, I should probably speak to someone and shit got real. Its like a dark, awful shadow. Sometimes the it is twenty steps behind. Sometimes it is breathing over my shoulder. Either way it is always there, and it is the hardest thing to know. Il never outrun it. I am just waiting for the day. Itl catch up. I am not actively suicidal. I wish I was honestly, but I just do not have the guts. I know I probably never will. I hope most days that something would do it for me and there would be no parents left wondering why I did it. Tragic accidents are just tragic accidents, right? No sense to be made of them. I moved away for a job around miles. All the family and friends I grew up with are a long way away, and I only have a few friends where I am now, I confided in one of those friends that I was really lonely and struggling and did not know what to do. She was helpful, I guess probably as helpful as anyone can be, but she is in a new relationship now, so I guess her attention is and probably should beconfusion completely on that. She said about making every wednesday a pub night, but nothings come from that. I think she forgot about everything the minute sheLeft to be honest, and that is fine. She is not responsible for me and my feelings. It is my burden, but it honestly would have hurt less to have just confided in a brick wall, because at least I would have known nothing would come of it. She does not know the full extent of how I feel, though no one does. Who do you tell whose the appropriate person to lay that on the doorstep of? I am speaking to my doctor soon, but it took weeks just to get an appointment set up. I want to ask for a psychiatric evaluation, but who knows if il get it, or even how long itl take? Not even sure why I am writing this honestly. Its just such a lonely, dark place to be no one to talk to, no one to hug or cry on the shoulder of. The only thing I love in this world is my dog, and I have spent the past few days wondering who id leave him with if I was ever to do anything, ive asked him if he would miss me, and if he is mind, if he stayed with his grandma, hes the only reason I get up in the morning. But at what point is he suffering too, and would be better off without me? I just do not think I am built for this world. I am too broken, and there is no fix. Objectively. I know that there is not a magic fixFor depression. But the thought of having to fight with everything I have in me just for an ounce of joy every single god damn day. What is the point? I am just so tired, so tired. I do not love anything anymore except for my dog. I do not love my hobbies or work or music or anything I just want to die. I do not want to be here. Its too hard, and it will never get better, because il be like this forever. No point in a constant uphill battle. If there is nothing keeping you going, people die every day, good people that have families that love them and lots of friends and who leave a gaping hole in the world they leave behind. Why cannot it be me instead,

Because your are here for a purpose you are here to make a change for someone is elses life for the better alcohol does not help when your sad it just amplifies the emotion I know from experienceconfusion your dog would miss you and I am sure other people would also miss you consider this a moment weakness in your life and it will be followed by a moment of clarity in which you will be beyond glad you have overcome this feeling please do reach out if you need someone anyone people want to help because we know what it is like to not have someone when we needed it meds do help I can confirm this first week was hard but it got easier and I felt better stay strong and do not give in to the darkness

I used to be a major asshole to everyone in high school and back in my hometown. I have moved away for several years now and have really changed my attitude and gratitude. But the people who hated me will not ever get to see this version of me. Its clingy and depressing to know. So many people probably still look at me as a complete jerk with emotional problems.
Comments
When you are open with people how you are now changed and realize what kind of person you were back then and what caused those issues, the word will reach those people at some point people are curious to know about others, and especially if you were the bad guy back then. It is super interesting to hear maybe they hope you have got your karma and so on but the truth will get to them and they have to accept it. You will not be forgiven most likely because that is very hard but truth is truth.

After my therapy december, it was getting better. But since new year, everything went down, I want to end myself again. Like years ago, nobody of my friends, even the best one, dont know how I am doin in. So I try to tell you guys here on reddit about to find some people who knows how you feel when you are sad and tired. If I say it in my parents words, sry for my bad englishconfusion and for weeks straight, the suicidal thoughts came up again. I hate being at school at home or even at my pa, where I normally feel better because I can escape reality. Do I deserve this pain? Why
Comments
No, you do not deserve this pain. I do not think anyone does. Depression is a real sickness. And if comes with ups and downs, maybe try to remember how you felt when you was happy and try to work towards that feeling again. Note that you cannot always feel happy, but for sure you can. You deserve it.

Title: Am I a good person?

Confusion. I do not understand. My way of thinking. I feel everyone is out to get me. And the only reason I have genuine connections with people is because of the trauma or pain we relate to. I feel selfish, misunderstood, awkward and clammy. I am always paranoid and stressed out, even if there is no reason to be. And I do not like socializing. I am always the one to get fucked over in most situations, and it hurts because most of the time, I do not care but then end up exploding months later about it confusing everyone
Comments
I think other people make you feel like you are a bad person, but you aren. I have a similar experience. I am selfish and greedy, and I do not really show emotions. People tell me I am a bad person, and I actually believed them for a while. I talked with my best friend about this, and he made me realize people are just quick to judge you without really knowing you.

I usually do not get shit done because of depression and probably undiagnosed adhd currently in the process of diagnosis thoconfusion, I just can. But today was not to bad. I reorganization my school bag and cursed out its weight. Seriously, keg cant be healthyconfusion. I kind of cleaned my room did a presentation for music class music classconfusion and showered. Sadly, the feeling of emptiness and pain was still there. I basically lost hope that it will get better. Tho I wish it would. I wish after school, I will see some future for myself and actually know what I want to study. I wish that suicide would not be an option anymore.
Comments
Yeah, personally, I go in waves that usually go months. I have learned that I have to pull the reins back when I am feeling good and productive, because I get in over my head when I crash, I am currently just starting my down swing this past week. The hardest thing for me to learn was to accept that I deserve time to relax and enjoy the good things you got shit done today. That is awesome. You deserve to be proud of yourself for that. I have done therapy before and currently on medication. I know that suicide is always going to be something that I am capable of. That does not mean I am going to let it be an option. There are good days ahead. It is a grind. It sucks when we feel like this, but it is worth it.

Let me say this loud and clear for the people in the back, it is not your fault. You are the victim, it not your fault at all. Be gentle on yourself. Op get yourself a new support group if this is how they act.

Title: The end is near.
Thread
Just venting here. As I feel I do not have anyone to talk to about this. My mind is raising. There are so many things I am thinking I would like to do before I die. So many projects I want to start so many regrets. I feel like I am a waste and not strong enough for this world. A few days ago, I was thinking on just ending it, and then I ended up thinking about the trauma of people who might find me and my family, even though I am alone for the majority of time, the expenses, etc. I guess I could say I do not because of other people, but I also think it is not the right way atleast for me. So I guess in a weird way, I am not ready yet. Sometimes it scares me how calm I am about making plans for an ending, because all the plans I try to live circle back to me, feeling more depressed. How do I get over myself? I am just so stuck. Whenever I feel I am getting there and making progress, seeing a ray of light, then get blinded, fall and end up much deeper in the dark. This is so hard I wish I was stronger, I will try to get stronger, do things that might relax me and try to be useful in this world. I try and try. I try to say goodbye, and I chokeconfusion, but I fail, I fail. I fail. I guessI will start the cycle again and see how far I can get this time. If not, we all must die one day anyway, right?

Title: I am not ok laughing out loud

I just not. I just did a safety plan with not my therapist, but a therapist, long storyconfusion. And there is like people in the whole world whose name number I gave as someone I would call in a crisis, but in reality, I wouldn. I already know I wouldn. The one person I would have called, who I felt seen by, understood I ve lost through my own batshit, crazy antics. I do not blame him. Nobody else gets it, but maybe he did not even get it either. Maybe I just have him on a pedestal. Maybe there is actually nothing special about him other than his ignoring me. I think this is a half assed attempt to convince myself of something I know is not true, but it is true that talking with him has made me upset in the past couple daysconfusion. I do not know. I hate that. I like this. It is hard for other people to deal with me. Imagine being this. I cannot get away from this bitch, but I doing my best in the therapy program I in. I guess it is going all right, even if things do not feel that way. But man, I wish I never came to this planet. Also, I probably going to delete this post. Thanks for reading.

You should absolutely tell her mother immediately when someone is at the stage that they have a full plan, it is no longer time for secrets from their parents. This will be the only way to get her help.

You know, your depression is bad when you cannot remember a life where it was not present, like trying to remember the child I used to be never not once was it without depression and anxiety? I guess I should be used to the impending highs and lows of life. But for me, a high in life is when my depression is bearable, which is rare, and a low is pretty much the norm, the everyday hell I have to endure because other people love and care about me. I could never put myself first, because then I would hurt them, and I would be selfish. I would be an absolutely horrible human. What happens when I am too tired to keep up this facade? It does not matter, because I have to keep faking it. Wear that hypothetical mask to please everyone else, fake it until you make it upside down face

Yeah, same. Some days it is a lot harder than others and I do not like talking about it because most people have a tough time understanding how just living can be so painful. I do not have a solution for you, but I know how it feels cause I feel the same way.

My cats have been my biggest reason for staying alive for years now your cat will not just miss you. He will not understand why you left him. He will keep waiting for you to come back and not understand why you dont. Our pets are a part of our worlds, but we are their entire worlds.

I am such worthless garbage. No matter what I do, I just ruin things. I try to make friends, but nobody wants to talk to me. I try to be nice to everyone, but it does not matter. I have never been close to anyone and everyone ghosts me. It is obviously my fault. I just suck. I am so terrible, they realized I am not worth talking to and leave. I just annoy everyone. I cannot even help people in similar situations since I am so trash at talking from lack of social experience because I am garbage, I should die. I should just let a car run me over or hang myself already. Nothing I ever do brings anything good. I am not worth talking to. I am not worth working with. I hate being alive.

You made a good first step. Depression is very isolating. I have been battling suicidal ideation most of my life since I was twelve. The one thing I have learned is there is normal and there is normal for me. Thoughts and feelings are not fact they are reactions that do not really define who I am. They come from me, but they are not part of me, and I certainly do not have to act on them. I have come to a place of peace. I accept I may have these thoughts all my life. This too shall pass it nice to meet you are not as bad as you think.

I think it is uncommon, but I try to do the same usually. What comes with depression are feelings of guilt and shame to dampen those feelings. I think it is only helpful to see it as an illness that you should not feel ashamed about. I hope someday, society can look at it the same way. Luckily, it is slowly getting better.

If it leads to a job where you can make money and be happy, why not finish if it leads to a job where you are not making money and will not be happy, quit its other skills you could learn without spending much money. However certain degrees pay off like some people learn computer stuff online and use that to gain experience to get the higher paying jobs. So many self learn tools now have a look around and see if you can picture yourself doing it. I quit things and regret it because either I was stressed or depressed it just delays your progress and sometimes send you back to square. So planning ahead and following through is important

Title: Fuck counselors.
Thread
My depression had been really high functioning I was just doing really bad mentally. It was to point where I could not get out of bed to go to school. My parents did not know what to do, so we went to see my counselor be before she had said if they needed help to reach out anyway, we get there and off the bat she asks me what is wrong honestly I did not know what to say. I mean, I did not know how I felt or how to say it into words, so I just started to cry and say I did not know. She then kept giving me dirty looks because I would not say how I was feeling supposedly, somehow you always magically know how your feeling. According to her, she kept forcing me to talk about how I felt. I sincerely could not say anything because I simply did not know. She said I was hiding something because I was this sad for no reason. She basically said she could not do anything, and that my abscenes were not excused and that I needed to be responsible. I apparently needed to be put on a strict schedule and get my phone taken away. I also needed to delete social media, even though that has nothing to do with what is going on. I barely even use. But she kept insisting it was hurting me. She also did that toxic thankfulness where you have everything you need to be happy. ButOther people dont other peoplehave physical sufferings so you do not have any reason to be sad. She told my parents to lock up the medicine. Thats when I knew it. I had to kill myself. She made me feel so alone I was already having a hard time and it was just the straw that broke the camels back. I trusted her so much and this hurt so much. When I got home, I tried to od I was in the hospital for a full week.

In my experience, that is what they do. You enter to the counselor for first time and they ask you, what is wrong? What happens to you or other question like that?

First of all sorry if my english is bad I have been suffering with mental health problems since I turned and its getting worse the older I get these last four years have been the worse years of my life im suicidal pretty much everyday every hour sometimes I cry at random moments for example when im in the store or when im driving a wave of sadness hits me and I begin to cry and I try to hide it the things I used to love dont make me feel anything anymore I lost all the passion in life. When I go outside, everything feels grey or empty I get derealization sometimes and let me tell you its fucking hell I wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy. My memory is bad now I cant concentrate I have tics and sometimes I have poor judgement. Sometimes I think if im suffering from dementia, even though im barely an adult, this depressive episode began like years ago. I isolated myself and I dont know how to get out of this hole that I created for myself. I have friends, but only hang out with them on some weekends. Besides that I barely have a social life, I dont know how I lost control of my life so fast I was considered smart and attractive, I have a decent economic situation, and I have awesome parents, although not perfect, im lost. Havent told anyone about this because I convince myself that the best option for me isTo kill myself. I have become jealous of people that are happy with the simple things, people that have a loving partner and have a huge social circle. And the thing is, I could have all those things, but instead I isolate myself. My brain is a mess, and honestly, I think im not going to see the end of this decade. It makes me so fucking sad to have wasted my life so hard when I had everything. And even more, what can I do? How do I prepare this mess? Why cant I be happy and enjoy life?

Even though I am barely an adult, you are as close to as you are dude, speak, to a medical professional, seeking online guidance from other misguided people will only cause more issues for you are young.

First of all sorry if my english is bad I have been suffering with mental health problems since I turned and its getting worse the older I get these last four years have been the worse years of my life im suicidal pretty much everyday every hour sometimes I cry at random moments for example when im in the store or when im driving a wave of sadness hits me and I begin to cry and I try to hide it the things I used to love dont make me feel anything anymore I lost all the passion in life. When I go outside, everything feels grey or empty I get derealization sometimes and let me tell you its fucking hell I wouldnt wish this on my worst enemy. My memory is bad now I cant concentrate I have tics and sometimes I have poor judgement. Sometimes I think if im suffering from dementia, even though im barely an adult, this depressive episode began like years ago. I isolated myself and I dont know how to get out of this hole that I created for myself. I have friends, but only hang out with them on some weekends. Besides that I barely have a social life, I dont know how I lost control of my life so fast I was considered smart and attractive, I have a decent economic situation, and I have awesome parents, although not perfect, im lost. Havent told anyone about this because I convince myself that the best option for me isTo kill myself. I have become jealous of people that are happy with the simple things, people that have a loving partner and have a huge social circle. And the thing is, I could have all those things, but instead I isolate myself. My brain is a mess, and honestly, I think im not going to see the end of this decade. It makes me so fucking sad to have wasted my life so hard when I had everything. And even more, what can I do? How do I prepare this mess? Why cant I be happy and enjoy life?

I feel you, man, I got no fucking interest in life, no social interactions. And every single fucking day is an iteration of the previous one. I see the people who I once used to hang out with progressing in life and achieving goals. When I am to tired, to even get out of bed, shit fucking sucks. Life is like a cold, stale, bland meal.

Title: If I could live life like today was my last
Thread
If I could live life like today was my last. I would start the day at am to get an early start, I would get up out of bed and walk straight out the door to see the sparkling blue waters of the pool in my backyard. Hopefully it is not too cold, but just cold enough to give you the goosebumps. To give you the necessary feeling to wake up, I would lay down on the icy cobblestone pooldeck and bask in the warm, early morning sunlight. Something about feeling the cold on my back and the warmth of the sun on my front just gives me the warm and fuzzies I would slowly breathe in through my nose. What is left of the morning dew on a bright green lawn until I can breathe in? No more. Focusing on the feeling of the air filling up my lungs reaching every corner, I would imagine the feeling as if my lungs were filling up for the first time. Then after holding it in for secs, I would puff up my chest and quickly exhale while slowing down the release, refreshing. And then I would hear chris smith voice right above me activate sonic boom!

I would probably sleep in as late as I wanted. Then id probably smoke ice till I was erratic as hell. Then id engage in some wierd sexual things then id end the night smoking dope till my eyes bulged out of my skull. Then id accept with some of my fav munchies that it is been a crazy run and that I at least went out with a bang. Its funny what we would all choose to each their own.

Yes, I have an apartment, a job, etc. But this is a miserable life. All I do is wake up, go to work, get home, make dinner, watch youtube, sleep. And in the weekends, I just watch youtube and sleep.

Title: I really need help with my girlfriend. I am desperate already.
Thread
Dear reddit users how mentioned I really need help with my girlfriend we are a couple for years now, and I am really convinced that she is the love of my life she is having a really bad time lately since we are a couple I learned to take care of her and to accept her the way she is of course constantly looking to help her she wanted to get therapy but couldnt motivate herself to call all the psychotherapists. This is really hard in german I dont know how it is in other countriesconfusion. So I called about therapists to get her into therapy. She is also on duloxetin, an snriconfusion, but somehow things are just getting worse lately, after she got kicked out from her parents, we moved together, but in a city about am away from her home due to couid, she did not go to the university, and because she has no friends in our city, she is never leaving the home. I have to get the grocery I am working fulltime. I am cooking. I am doing basically everything because she is just down all the time. I dont blame her. Dont get me wrong. I also got a dog for her so that shes not that lonely when I am at work, but however, she does not have any social contact at all. She is anxious to go out for a walk because she is afraid of being seen and judged by people. She is not the skinniest. IfYou understandconfusion today. She told me that she would like to do stuff with me, but I really cant motivate her to do literally anything. She is studying art and can draw and craft sculptures really good. But she lost basically every interest in anything. I have multiple drugs at home, like opioids, benzodiazepines, er cetera. And she told that she is waiting the whole day until it is night, so that she can have some benzodiazepines not to sleep, but to get high. And thats a conflict inside of me. I know the extremely strong addictive potential those substances have, and I wouldnt like to give them to her. But on the other hand, nothing else can make her happy. She is not addicted yet, on days where she is really busy by driving to her hometown, to her psychotherapistconfusion and back, she can sleep easily due to I would almost call it fatigue and not even ask for anything to sleep. This is destroying me everytime when she is laughing about one of my jokes, or just when I see a smile in her face. This means the world to me. So enough story here I would he really glad if anybody here would have some experiences with situations like that, and how I could motivate my of to do something no matter how small these things are, is sry if my english isnt perfect, sometimes I didnt sleep for nights and going to bed? Now, much love you all

All my life. Video games have been my therapy and relief. But now I see what the fuck is the point in buying video games if my life is still absolute shit, with no job, no money, having to depend on my parents at years old, no girl, no, anything. I have no purpose. And I am just here in my house, going to my bathroom at night, crying my eyes out, tried to slit my wrist. But im too much of a fucking pussy to do that live in my own of damn fantasy that do not exist. Having a imaginary girlfriend imagining I am talented, imagining I am handsome, imagining I am succeeding in life. But no, this pessimistic damn couid virus stopped me in my tracks when I was so fucking close to getting a job, and now I cannot even get fucking job due to my dad not wanting anyone to catch couid and get any family in my home sick. Fuck my life! Fuck my shitty choices. And fuck my pathetic extreme social anxiety, depression and porn issues that makes me feel like a worthless sack of shit. If my life is suppose to just be like this till the end of my days than I would rather die right now, it like the universe itself trolls me and says, you thought you could succeed, loser, but no, your just a fucking joke. So go, fuck yourself! You are nothing. Also for the people that claim. Oh, girls are not allThat oh, you will get a girl day. How the fuck do you know if your not a virgin yourself? That struggle with girls stop giving false hope. It easy for you to say that when you got some pussy. So oh, ho! Good for you, but im still a fucking virgin loser there. I needed to let that out.

Sometimes you do not need to say anything. Your presence can be enough to let her know that you are there for her by her side. It can be difficult to talk during these times, so maybe check in if she is eaten, drank water and maybe bring her a favourite snack every once in a while. Try not to push her too harshly to do anything. You can suggest watching a show together going out for food, etc. Its good to get out once in a whileconfusion. You are a good person.

I have felt this way many times over the years, but the last one was the most devastating. It was right before couid hit. Things were pretty shit, but I had established a social routine and found a better paying job. I was meeting new people, actually getting some dates and working on a plan for the future. Then it all turned to shit. I have not recovered since. I never will now too old, too broken, too alienated and alone, too full of regrets.

First of all, do not feel guilty. Op we are just human, and we make mistakes. Don be so hard on yourself. If you fail today, then try tomorrow, and if you fail the day after that, then try again the day after that, but do not give up. It takes ages to form good habits, and our body will constantly reject something its not used to. Its just a pity that forming bad habits are so much easier. You feel tired because you are depressed and you are depressed because you feel tired. Among other things, you need to break the bad habits. Some, how good luck op will cross my fingers for you

Title: My friend and I drifted apart after I made her get help for depression.
Thread
So I have my own thoughts on this matter, but I would like to know what other people think when I was in high school, my best friend was suffering from extreme depression. She was not coming to school except maybe once a week. And her parents were an extreme catholic, she was scared they might call an exorcist if she told them she was depressedconfusion. Over the months, I would do anything I could for her available talk or text, sending her info on her assignments be in a group project with her specifically. So she did not have to worry about it confusion all the while I had been encouraging her to talk to the school counselor since they would be able to help and do more than I could. But she did not want her parents to be involved at all. The thing that tip me over the edge, though, was when she told me that she had found some of her moms sleeping pills and just downed what was left in the bottle. She assured me that it was just to get high. But all I could think about was how luck that I was not to go to her funeral that next day, she also happened to come to school, and I gave her an ultimatum. Either you go and talk to the counselor or I will, she went. And she told him the situation. After that, she got help and slowly but surly became brighter and more distant by theTime the next school year came around it was just short conversations I could tell she was avoiding me too but I let her because she was actually happy I guess I am just wondering if this is normal or if someone else has experienced something similar I think I just reminded her of either the worst parts of herself or all the hard ship she had to endure anyways. I would just like to hear other peoples thoughts.
Comments
I think you did the right thing. You gave her a tough choice. Maybe she will resent you for it. Ultimately, I think she will appreciate what you did down the road. Her reaction is normal, limo. If normal is even possible. Considering the illness, you can try to reach out to her, not necessarily to be friends again, but to get closure and clear the air.

Title: I am tired of this circle.
Thread
I read some posts that are similar to what I feel a few days ago, but still, I need to put it out of my chest, because honestly, I am feeling shit. I am male asexual. My romantic life is as awful as it can be. I never dated or anything. Every time I try to get involved romantically with someone I am rejected. It is not even because I am ace. I rarely tell this to people and they still reject me. My hypothesis is that I am too feminine to classical women to like me and too masculine to non classical women to like me. Plus, I am in the autistic spectrum. So that makes me annoying for some people, and most of them do not even treat me as a human being. I am tired of repeating the circle of meeting someone new, start to like them and being rejected. I feel like I am worthless and broken, that I do not matter at all. And to make it worst, all of the sudden, in the beginning of this year, every one I know started dating. Almost every time I hang out with my friends, they take one or more girlfriends and boyfriends, which make me feel like a third wheel all the time. And it is like the universe is constantly reminding me everything that I cannot ever have. I am just sad, depressed and super tired. Amp I apologize for my english. It is not my first language

What the point when you cannot even enjoy what you used to love and have no motivation to do anything else. I feel like I am different people, the one I pretend to be infront of others and the one who is slowly killing himself from the inside. I try to get help.

I do not want to be a burden on the people I care about, so I push them away. I threw away my last relationship because of it when she was probably my best hope out of this hole that I have dug myself into. I have tried different medication, but they do not do anything.

Title: I feel so sorry towards my parents.
Thread
They re the sole reason I have not ended everything yet they re pretty much the best parents I could ever ask for, and I could not bring myself to break their heart like this. I selfishly also do not think I would be able to end up with better parents even if I reincarnated as someone else if that is even a thing I was born in a shitty east asian country with abysmal wages and ridiculous working hours. But my parents are both doctors while not crazy rich, they did their best to give me everything I wanted. I am in my the year of uni and I am on exchange in canada. My trip is, of course funded by my parents. My mom just texted me about the things we could do if we had a house in canada and that fucking broke me. I am blindly studying in one of those fields that will not bring you any decent paying jobs because I am fucking stupid. I got into the top university in my country. I got straight as. But in the end, none of these matter, because I will never be able to make enough money to give my parents what they deserve. And the worst part is that they never blame me and still have hope for me, telling me about the stuff we can do together when they retire and I get a job or something. I do not have the heart to tell them that is not goingTo happen and that I am sorry for being a fucking stupid, useless child. I know they will just tell me I am not, but I am. I wish I was never born, and that my place was given to another sperm that was smarter, prettier and not a depressed clump of shit like me.

I have a pretty similar situation. I am asian as well, and the only reason im alive right now is because I think about all the effort my parents put into raising me, and I cant just end it like this for them. They worked so hard to put me through school, and I just ended up a failure. All I can say is, try to hang in there. Im feeling pretty hopeless myself right now, but typing stuff up like this and venting helps

Just do not stop taking it by yourself. Talk about this to your doctor, and if they think the medication is doing more harm than good, they will prescribe the best strategy to get you off the current one to try another but never stop without medical support as it could backfire.

Title: Im suffering from crippling depression and getting constant su tidal thoughts, confusion.
Thread
So im a years kid, confusion, and im going thru alot of stuff. I really dont know where to start or what to say or what details I should put in. So im someone who has all of his personal issues or personal stuffs kept to themselves. Ive had massive trust issues since I was a literal child, and ive never really opened up to anyone in almost my entire life. Ive never built strong friendships with too many pal. I only had one, and I gladly still have him as a gud friend. But we dont really like talk that much over the internet. I was am pretty much an introvert, and we never really hanged out that much except schoolconfusion. So at the start of grade yearoconfusion, I hit depression because of all these loneliness, low self esteem and insecurity stuff. And it was pretty bad I wont lie. And it went on for a while, like months or so until one day, I met someone over the internet, and we live in the same country, but pretty far and different towns. And he introduced me to his friends. We started knowing each other and everything. So one of his friend was a girl, and at first we were just normal friends, and pretty much spent most of our time talking, and knowing more about each other. Since we were just strangers online. She didnt really revealed her face for the first couple months, and I didnt ask again and again, neither did iForce her to do a face reveal, cuz its her free will to do it or not. And im someone who never really had a crush or liked someone in like a romantic way. But after months or so, I started to find her really amazing. And im someone who really adores personality, and she had a great one. Shes supportive, amazing, comforting. Basically a place where I felt really safe. She revived me from depression, and I realized that I started to like someone more like a crush. We grew pretty closer to each other and was pretty much the closest person to each other everyday. I woke up wishing her a gud morning, and every night id go to sleep, writing like a character long essay and wishing her gud night and being happy that I have a closest friend, a certain someone I can say anything to without any hesitation, until I hurt her. Brutally. Near the end of december, I brutally hurt her, broke her trust and slandered her, and I promise it was all unintentional. I cant go in depth, because its an insanely long story. But please note that I really didnt have any intentions to do any of these, and I didnt really think my actions were this much brutal when I realized I made her cry, which I really never imagined to do. I broke down. Ive had multiple mental breakdown since then had another one, like, last night when I heard that she cried because of whatI did. I couldnt take it anymore. I broke down. I really, insanely regret what I did. I tried to clear up everything with her, but she seems to find me untrustworthy after what ive done, and I understand her perspective. I had a random dream last july that she left me, and I instantly woke up feeling suffocating and crying in my dream. Well, last january, it she left me, and since then, im really unable to find any kind of happiness in anything. Playing pa games used to be a fine source of joy for me, but since she left, everything just died for me. Im unable to bear things anymore. I feel really ashamed for what I did to her. I regret it so much that im actually wishing my own death to happen very soon for a while. Now I remember telling her at january the after I hurt her, amd tried to clear things upconfusion that I love her. She replied that I actually dont love her and called me stupid. And I really do understand her perspective. I hurt her, backstabbed her unintentionally, and now, after that, im saying that I love her. I understand how fucking fake this sounds. But ive never loved someone this much. Im willing to wait for her for years to come back, and I am waiting. Its just I cant take it anymore. All my insecurities that got banished when she was here came back. I have crippling depression and loneliness and regret andSince the past days, my physical health is declining as well as my mental health too. I keep getting suicidal thoughts and ink. What to do. I just wanted to get all of this from my head and share it to someone I know its a really long read. And if you did read everything here, I really appreciate you and it really means a lot to me. Have a great day confusion.

But if she blocked you, then the best thing would be to take it as a lesson learned and use every day after that to grow spirutally and emotionally. Dont put all of your worth into this one girl. You have so much potential and you will experience love again.

Title: Does the feeling of wanting to die ever go away?
Thread
I had a suicide attempt about a year ago, and no matter how much therapy or work I put into myself that feeling of wanting to die never goes away. I am not one of those people that were grateful they lived, I still hate the fact that I failed. Does the feeling of wanting to die ever go away?
Comments
I have not stopped having suicidal thoughts either, but I know its pointless to hurt myself. So I stopped hurting myself. Over a year ago, I was angry that I lived and that I am still here. I wish I had died. I totally understand how you feel, because I feel the same way. Maybe you will not stop feeling that way, but you can keep living without hurting yourself even if you have negative thoughts. After all, I am still here, and so are you we exist and keep going despite the suffering we feel each day.

I suffer from depression, which often leads me to struggle with basic tasks, getting up, brushing my teeth, confusion. But I am seeing my best friend today. I got up early, got dressed, brushed my teeth, had breakfast, took my meds and even washed up. I am so grateful for him.

All my life. Video games have been my therapy and relief. But now I see what the fuck is the point in buying video games if my life is still absolute shit, with no job, no money, having to depend on my parents at years old, no girl, no, anything. I have no purpose. And I am just here in my house, going to my bathroom at night, crying my eyes out, tried to slit my wrist. But im too much of a fucking pussy to do that live in my own of damn fantasy that do not exist. Having a imaginary girlfriend imagining I am talented, imagining I am handsome, imagining I am succeeding in life. But no, this pessimistic damn couid virus stopped me in my tracks when I was so fucking close to getting a job, and now I cannot even get fucking job due to my dad not wanting anyone to catch couid and get any family in my home sick. Fuck my life! Fuck my shitty choices. And fuck my pathetic extreme social anxiety, depression and porn issues that makes me feel like a worthless sack of shit. If my life is suppose to just be like this till the end of my days than I would rather die right now, it like the universe itself trolls me and says, you thought you could succeed, loser, but no, your just a fucking joke. So go, fuck yourself! You are nothing. Also for the people that claim. Oh, girls are not allThat oh, you will get a girl day. How the fuck do you know if your not a virgin yourself? That struggle with girls stop giving false hope. It easy for you to say that when you got some pussy. So oh, ho! Good for you, but im still a fucking virgin loser there. I needed to let that out.

Title: High functioning with chronic depression.
Thread
Sometimes I feel like it is just me. That is like this. I have a great job, lots of friends, a beautiful home, and I am engaged to a good person. But my depression never leaves for long. Its always under there. And when it bubbles up to the surface, I become someone, and something completely different. I do not get out of bed. I skip meetings at work. I sleep all day. You could not pay me to pick up the phone and call someone or leave the house for any reason. And yet, no one besides my fianc knows how bad it is. Even he does not know how bad it is, because he goes to work. I work from home, so I am alone all day everyday. He does not know how often I stay in bed the entire day and then shower right before he gets home. He does not know a fraction of the nightmares I have. Theyare brutal, horrific dreams, and neither does anyone else. My friends and family have no idea who I am. They have no idea that I am so severely depressed, I am a big ball of positivity and energy, and I love to build people up. I love to see people and make plans and all that good stuff. But it feels like I am insane because of how severe the highs and lows are. I am both outgoing and extremely depressed and introverted. I used to thrive when I went to the office becauseWork was an escape from my brain now that I do not go to an office, I have nothing to distract me from my own shit, and I am extremely embarrassed to talk to anyone about my depression, because I know it sounds like I am ungrateful and ridiculous and have nothing to be upset about or depressed about. I am ashamed. I cannot stand myself.

Maybe you need to see someone to evaluate you and confirm your diagnosis. I am not sure if highs are common for depressed people, I could be wrong.

I am sorry you feel this way. You could have the greatest life that anyone would envy and still be depressed, or you could be a shut in with no friends or family, no work and no money and still be happy. Of course, there is a correlation, but there does not have to be. I can relate to your story because I also have a pretty good life, wonderful boyfriend, no financial troubles, friends, etc. I do not have the stable, nice job because my depressions keep coming back every year for years now, but I have kind of accepted it. I work for myself when I can, even though I do not make money, I also find myself to be really outgoing, wanting to meet up with people, and the next day crashing, not able to do anything I wonder everyday am I depressed when I am home? It sure looks like it. But how can I seem so happy when I am together with other people and joke and laugh all the time it, like hanging out with other people is my medication distracting and relieving myself from my own thoughts and feelings

Title: Any victories with overcoming depression will it always be this bad?
Thread
Hey, guys, I am looking for any inspiring stories or thoughts or advice about depression. I have been struggling with depression since I was. I am now. It started off as being somewhat manageable, but as the years went on and I went through multiple traumas, it is gotten so much worse, and I am currently experiencing the worst depression that I have ever had. Its really bad. I am diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, with intermittent major depressive episodes, along with other mental health diagnoses which are also raging. And I really feel like things are nearing the end. Does anyone have any experiences of overcoming depression or living a fulfilling life with it? I am desperate and would really appreciate any thoughts from anyone who is going through similar or from people who have been in this place and come out of it. Thank you so much. If you read this

Probably not for just thinking about it if you made an attempt then that would likely get you there but you said you are a minor so they do take suicidal ideation more seriously with minors because minors are more impulsive and it is more concerning if they have suicidal thoughts I would say tell your therapist it always helps to speak about things that are weighing heavily on your mind

I would tell your therapist, first of all, there is nothing wrong with needing to go into care psych ward or otherwise. Second, in my experience with institutional care, I found the help I needed more than in basic therapy. Third as a minor, it is important to get the care now rather than later.

My understanding is an involuntary can only be done if there is a legitimate threat of harm to self or others. What you have said does not qualify, in my opinion, why go to a therapist and not be honest it nice to meet you.

Title: If you have ever taken seroquel, please help.
Thread
I have been taking seroquel for the past two years for treatment resistant depression and anxiety. I was gaining too much weight from it and wanted to try a mood stabilizer instead. Lamictal, which is working. I am currently in the process of weaning off of the seroquel. I started at my then my for two weeks, my for a week, and I am supposed to be off it in a couple days. I have been having horrible effects, though heart pounding, dizziness, more anxiety symptoms, though I am on meds for that. But the worst one is my appetite. I am hungry. I feel that empty stomach feeling, but every time I try to eat more than a few bites of something, I start gagging and have to stop, I cannot physically fill my hunger. The only things I can somewhat tolerate are protein shakes. It may be withdrawal, but I thought the tapering off would have helped avoid that. Please help me. This is hell.
Comments
Seroquel causes horrific withdrawal symptoms that I have seen compared to the severity of withdrawal from hard drugs. My friend did not sleep for days when he stopped taking seroquel and he told me he felt like he was in hell. The only way to get through it is to power through and wait until the withdrawal is over.

After about a month on a cheap depression medication, I forget the name. At the momentconfusion, I began to feel better. Generally, the most stark and measurable change was that I had suicidal thoughts, barely at all. Even when I did get those thoughts, they were different, less serious feeling, very much a feeling that is hard to explainconfusion. Well, months into the medication, and I am starting to feel like I was faking being depressed and suicidal. I suppose it is a good feeling to have in comparison, but it is annoying.

Im right there with you. From the staring blankly down to the starved of affection, just thinking about missing out on life is already enough to push me into the deepest state of depression, and I completely lose focus and motivation.

I cannot find the slightest motivation to do any of the things that once I used to love. Most of my smiles are an act. I am starved of affection. I usually zone out and stare blankly. I lose focus. Too often, I have a creeping feeling that I am literally missing out on life itself, cause I cannot find joy or motivation for anything that pushes me to work on long term goals. I am so fucked up mentally that I do not have the courage to let you know about it, because I fear dragging you along. I feel miserable. I do not know how to ask for help. Hey, dude, all cool hub

I think this question is the question a lot of people ask but do not really want to know the answer to. Its just asked out of courtesy, and it is an automatic thing to do because it is so embedded in society. On the other hand, it can be painful to answer honestly, we tend to say im good but do not really mean it half the time we are either tired of talking about our problems or we are afraid to unload our burdens on people

Title: I have a son on the way, but I do not think I can wait for him anymore because of my depression.
Thread
I was reading post here at depression, and I thought maybe it would help me if I would post. I do not really know, but I guess it will not hurt to maybe ask help from you guys. I confusion was sexually assaulted by my best friend, confusion, which resulted with her pregnancy. And months ago, I was diagnosed with depression. Our parents decided that it is best if me and my best friend to build a relationship for our son. And I agreed because I wanted my son to have a complete family, something I never had. But the pressure and the trauma has been taking a toll on me, which eventually resulted with me having depression. I am currently in therapy, but I do not think it is helping. I do not know what other coping mechanism is available out there to possibly help me. I am tired, mentally, physically and emotionally, of fighting. I want to give up so bad and finally find peace. But I just feel so guilty to my son, if ever, he would grow up without a father. And I really wanted to raise him. But I do not think I can hang on a little longer. Do you guys have some advice, maybe, or like coping mechanism that may have worked on you? I really want to be there for my son or just make it until I can at least be there for his birth

Hi, that sounds like an absolutely horrid and foul situation. First of all, that person is not your best friend. Any human who does something that awful does not deserve that title. May I ask why you chose to keep the child?

Title: High functioning with chronic depression.
Thread
Sometimes I feel like it is just me. That is like this. I have a great job, lots of friends, a beautiful home, and I am engaged to a good person. But my depression never leaves for long. Its always under there. And when it bubbles up to the surface, I become someone, and something completely different. I do not get out of bed. I skip meetings at work. I sleep all day. You could not pay me to pick up the phone and call someone or leave the house for any reason. And yet, no one besides my fianc knows how bad it is. Even he does not know how bad it is, because he goes to work. I work from home, so I am alone all day everyday. He does not know how often I stay in bed the entire day and then shower right before he gets home. He does not know a fraction of the nightmares I have. Theyare brutal, horrific dreams, and neither does anyone else. My friends and family have no idea who I am. They have no idea that I am so severely depressed, I am a big ball of positivity and energy, and I love to build people up. I love to see people and make plans and all that good stuff. But it feels like I am insane because of how severe the highs and lows are. I am both outgoing and extremely depressed and introverted. I used to thrive when I went to the office becauseWork was an escape from my brain now that I do not go to an office, I have nothing to distract me from my own shit, and I am extremely embarrassed to talk to anyone about my depression, because I know it sounds like I am ungrateful and ridiculous and have nothing to be upset about or depressed about. I am ashamed. I cannot stand myself.

Youre not alone in this. And your post helped me realize I am not alone in this. I do not work from home or have nightmares, but everything else is pretty spot on from everyone elses perspective, I should feel nothing but happiness. Yet here I am wishing I could be done with life, the universe and everything. Yet here I am commenting on posts on reddit which will ironically live long beyond myself. Regardless of how I end, despite wishing it will all end. I have a weird sense of hope, and along with that hope, I hope I do not fuck it up. A very strange dichotomy and one I would soon be done with

I can relate to you so much I have a good job. I work out. I am fun to be around. I make jokes and laugh with my friends, but as soon as I am alone, everything underneath comes out and it is horrible. I feel like there is a switch that gets flipped when I am around someone else I am positive, I lift them up and the conversations are humorous alone. Me is so different I do not think anyone could guess what I am like when I am not around them.

Yes first recognize the thoughts and feelings you have are not facts they are reactions no one will be better off least of all you they come from you but are not part of you do not need to act on them as if they are true ink why you cannot seek mental health help it even online I am not diagnosing you but I have been dealing with depression and suicidal feeling over fifty years also I am a survivor of my wife suicide eight years ago she, too, thought she was doing me a favor I would say making this post is a positive thing real clinical depression depletes certain brain chemicals which affect mood behavior and self perception too unresolved. Trauma ptsdconfusion and substance abuse play a major role in suicidal people. I want you to know you have been heard your life is no less valuable than anyone else.

One think that has helped me is reading the comments of this posts on this subreddit. I have not gone to therapy either, but people who have experienced depression just know what to say to make a person feel a little better. Thats what I have been doing. And it works from time to time. I feel like whole family burden too. And that is something I cannot get out of my head either. I always think people will only act sad, but they will notice how their lives are so much better. One thing that has improved my mood is talking to people who make me laugh laughing genuinely is hard during a major depressive episode, but laughing when you are semi. Ok, help. It also helps to watch funny youtube. Just getting a smile out of you can help a little and trick your brain for a bit to think you are okay.

Title: I think I am losing my friends.

I have just been in this depressive episode since december. I do not go to school, I do it onlineconfusion, and the rest of my friends do, and they want me to come, but I just can. They ve invited me to parties, and I refused. I understand why they are pulling away. I am not making enough of an effort, and friendships are a two way street, but I feel so terrible about it. I feel like telling them what is going on at this point will just seem like an excuse. You know, they re amazing friends. It is fully my fault, but it feels like I am starting to damage our relationships to the point where they cannot be fixed anymore. Has anyone dealt with? This? Did anything help
Comments
If they are amazing friends, they would probably understand and try to help you as much as they can. I can personally relate to your feelings. I just never told them how I felt now I am all alone no one to talk to hang out with. So please at least try to rekindle your friendship.

Title: Why.
Thread
Why does anyone want to live on this god forsaken dying rock? Everything seems to be fueled by hate and greed from world politics and corporations to everyday actions from ordinary people. If you take two steps outside the shelter of a community and into the world, you are bombarded with hate towards everything possible. I feel awful living. I should not feel this way unless I am just seeing the world how it truly is. I got lucky when I was born, I am a white ab living in a developed country as a middle class citizen. I do not deserve that. If I could give it to someone else, I would, because I will end up dead anyways if I would suffer regardless of where I was. I wish that someone could take my place and be happy. Instead, I get diagnosed with disorder after disorder and prescribed medication that does nothing at best and often makes me worse. I am not meant to exist. People are beginning to realize that most of my friends have already left my family clings to the false hope of a cure. I will be gone soon enough. I never made any impact, so I will only be mourned by a handful of people, most of whom will forget me soon after. If there is some great plan, it seems like my only purpose was to cause pain to others. It would be better for everyone. If I never existed, not even better for everyone. Just better forA few people, I will just be a number on a chart of teen suicide to the vast majority of people all my pain summed up as a statistic, just another person who could not stand life. My life is not even that bad. Others live far worse lives and are ok with it. I am weak, defective. Even if I somehow make it to adulthood, I could never have a family. I would get close to someone knowing that I would hurt them badly and offspring would probably inherit my problems. I will never be important in anyones life never make a difference. I will be forgotten as soon as soon as anyone, my immediate family and three friends that still talk to me pass. If all I do is suffer and my suffering does not serve a purpose. Why should I exist? Why
Comments
We know we do not deserve it yet we still take advantage of it. Thats why we hate ourselves so much. We know we should not be ungrateful yet we still are. Its absolutely soul crushing, knowing we have no impact to society. Theres nothing special about us. Were just gifted individuals who just so happened to win a race. I can sympathize with you dude, were still clinging on to whatever we have left, hoping it gets better until the end.

I may be overreacting, but my little sister, who is in the grade, only acts just problematic. She openly says my cuts are mental illness so casually, she hit me hard twice on my face when I accidentally made her fall in a game. I took her ipad away out of frustration but never hit her back, cause I was on the verge of tears for me, showing that I cried is a sign of weakness. I have been hit a lot, so being just hit would make me cry. It is my trauma reaction. I do not know why she acts that way. She does not apologize at all and continues to ask why I took her ipad away. I just told her it is because of the way she behaved. I know she is young, but I am just sharing

Man I hear you wow, I have been here, and the only thing you can do is understand life or try to. What ive came to understand is everyone tries to make life a competition, but it really does not matter. We are all living in this messed up world. Some pal have more ambition or purpose, and it is viewed as they are doing the right thing. They are going down the right path of life. We all have different paths. What makes you happy in life? When I was originally thinking how you were thinking, the only things I liked in life was netflix and alcohol, lol. And that is okay. You have to just think about the future, which sucks to really think about, but honestly, you have to. At some point do you want to have kids? Do you want to have a family, etc. If your planned future is something you have to work for, then you really got to just go and have that future you as your motivation. The reason pal are so motivated is because they have a why they have something they are looking for, whether that is a future opportunity or just an inside goal. They are working towards something. Its hard to be motivated when you do not want anything in life. I have been there if you truly do not want anything in life, then life is hard. Bro, because we really are here for no reason. At the end of the day, weAre just here unless you actually want something, kids, a family, a career, etcconfusion. Its all up to the person.

Title: I am always high.
Thread
I feel like I am always on drugs even when I am not. I am high basically everyday, and when I am not high in spinning on antidepressants, I have not really had normal brain function for months, and I feel like I am going fucking crazy. Last summer, my mum got diagnosed with stage iv skin cancer, and it is gone down hill ever since then I am, and I have been smart all my life, but I feel like I am letting go. Now, I do not attend my lessons anymore. I have not done homework in months. I physically do not attend half of my exams. The worst part is that I hate it, but I do not know what to do sometimes. I wonder if it is the drugs. I think about how much time they take up and I really want to reclaim it, but I cant. I like them too much. I cannot give them up, I think by writing all of this out, I have realised that I have got to stop smoking so much because it is just taking up a lot of my time. But I am surrounded by people who only want to do drugs. Maybe I have got to change the people I surround myself with. Maybe I need to hang out with smarter and healthier people. Nothing is less helpful that being surrounded by depressed people when you are depressed, I am just at a loss. I guess
Comments
Youre not a loss. You matter the very ownership. You show in your post shows levels of maturity far beyond your years. I smoked weed for a while. It has a lot of negatives. The withdrawal is tough, increases depression, but do not give up. Youre smart, capable and intelligent. I always think to myself, who would I want my son daughter to be? Well show them what you are made of. Get help therapy helps, medical helps positive people help. No single one is a cure. Its day to day, minute to minute. You are not a loss. Dont believe that for a second.

For example, today at the gym I was doing a workout with a moderately heavy weight and perfect form and my training partner complimented me he said, thats really impressive. I giggled a bit and finished my set and assisted him in bettering his form. Another example is when a girl compliments me I think they are just making fun of me or joking around I have gad ocd and as a result, develop long bouts of severe depression. I was also bullied through my entire teenage years. Not until I went to college did I develop confidence in myself at people view me as a very confident guy, but in reality, I so self conscious and downplay. My accomplishments
Comments
When have dealt with depression for a long time, we have to relearn to be big and expansive it about having pride in self without it, we will blow past a compliment. Pride in self is when we do something good in life and how it makes you feel, let you feel good about yourself. Stay with that feeling of pride not be quick to dismiss. It will get easier over time. Pride in self is not to be confused with ego and arrogance.

If you like cooking history, science or religious studies, I can recommend some. I need that time to turn off my brain after a hard day and I think it is ok to do in moderation, you have what is called anhedonia. I have it too. It not your fault you cannot enjoy things as easily right now. Dopamine fasts and exercise and eating better can help a little bit.

Yes, engaging in stuff I do not care about is really hard for me, especially at work. I know I should just plow through it and get it done, but it literally feels like torture. Lying in bed is my only safe space. It is the only time I feel okay. I probably spend hours everyday, just looking for stuff to watch. And I always end up watching like minutes of the video before starting, too. Look for another one.

Speaking from experience, studying and depression do not mix well, sometimes you just got to give what you can then move on. It is much easier said than done, of course, but believe me, marks are not everything.

Title: My boyfriend is depressed and ink if I should keep going or give.
Thread
Hi. So I am depressed as well, but I have been in therapy for several years, and I am on medication, so I manage it fairly well. My boyfriend, however, has severe depression, which has largely gone unchecked throughout his life and regularly has suicidal thoughts. Recently, his depression has been getting worse to where he cannot think of anything but his stressors, to the point where he barely thinks about me. He says that it is made his feelings for me less strong, though he still loves me, I have been trying my best to support him through this time, but I am starting to lose strength. He does not take me out. He is always disconnected when we are together, and he is unsure of what he wants or if he wants a future for us. In short, my needs are not being met. I feel really lonely and uncared for a lot of the time, and like I am putting all the effort in and not getting anything back, weve talked about this, and he even suggested breaking up because he did not think he could meet my needs in his current state, I would agree. But he just started therapy today. So I do not know if I should stick it out and hope it gets better or just throw in the towel. Its hard because we care for each other a lot and have a really good connection. Otherwise, I do not want to give up. But I do not knowHow much longer I can continue like this. Thanks for reading if you got this far.

With him starting therapy, he is at least making an attempt to improve the situation. My past is probably too close to your situation for me to be totally objective.

Title: I passed my chronic depression on to my kid.
Thread
How do I fix this? He told me today that he really just feels like nothing. He is not happy, nothing makes him happy. He is hoping to join the military after high school, so he can be deployed and die in combat, because suicide would be an inconvenience to everyone. He says he will live. But he does not see the point. And if things get too painful, suicide is a solid plan, and I completely understand him. I use suicidal thoughts as a coping mechanism. Planning is a way to soothe my anxiety, and when I cannot plan to solve a problem, I plan my death to calm myself down until I can solve the problem. I did tell him how valuable and important he is to me and how much I want him in the world, just how he is nor the idea of who he could be. I also told him that sometimes you have to seek out things to give you a little joy, and maybe we can be more intentional about that. He made one attempt, years ago, he in therapy and on meds. What can I do? I know the answer is not really much of anything, but I feel like I am so broken, and I am spreading it to my kids

Get your son a emotional support animal. I think it would really help him cope and would give him a friend around, maybe even get him a counselor.

Title: Why do I hate myself?
Thread
The amount of negative things I think about myself daily is enough to make anyone go mad. Do I do it because I think I deserve it? Or does it come from something that I was taught to do from a young age? I do not want to hurt myself anymore, but it does not translate in my mind. Im stuck in this feeling of neglect for myself and not being there to help myself get out of it. I do not want to be trapped in my mind anymore. I need some help, but I do not know where to start

Yep, conditioning. You can recondition your brain, but it takes hard work and persistence. I was also just taught this by people in my family. I am still trying to learn. What are my thoughts is what I heard growing up, which was basically just hate. Ask yourself questions like, why am I thinking this? What is triggering it? Am I in a better environment now? Etc.

There is a girl I like, but because of my codependency and hypersensitivity, I take her words too personal, and the way she talks sometimes just hurts me. We cannot have normal conversations without a discussion. Thats when, at the moment that she is offended by something, I try to explain to her why I did this, and during the moments, she is offended. The way she just talks just hurts me. And that is when I am telling her that it hurts what I say, she then says to me that I need to stop playing victim. But yeah,

I was in the same relationship, man I am telling you not worth it if you cannot talk to her and figure out some mutual ground has put me into a state now that I do not have that girl and I am just depressed and do not want to even try to make friends.

They cannot deal with yours.

Title: Sertraline.

Been on my sertraline for days and to say, it is been a rough ride would be an understatement. My intrusive thoughts are still really strong. I cannot sleep at night because of them. Before I started taking the drug, the thoughts were there, but I was sleeping. Now I am exhausted, which is making things worse I feel and I am still unable to really eat. Is there anything I can do? Has anyone had the same problems before things have got better?
Comments
I was on the same dose and it eventually just got worse, had the same side affects you are talking about. And then it started affecting me in weird ways like I could not evac anymore. Yea seriouslyconfusion, my body would just like convulse and I could not climax no matter I did, even during sex and stuff. I waited the month as well but the side effects were too much. I would inform your doctor therapist and ask about other meds. Sis did not go well for me but saris worked super well with no side affects minimal for me, particularly wellbutrin. I would not keep taking something if you are experiencing side affects that affect your well being kinda defeats the purpose, especially if you are not sleeping. Hope this helps the right meds make all the difference. My man

Personality tests are generally designed for the mentally stable of us. If you are struggling with depression, the test will not accurately reflect your personality a few positive things tho are the generally people struggling with depression have higher iq than people who have never struggled are more empathetic and are really good listeners.

Traditional personality tests can be hard on, the more neurotic among us they paint us as defective. This is made worse by popular culture that celebrates only positive affect in truth, depression and neuroticism represent a greater sensitivity to people, life and beauty. Some of the greatest thinkers artists pioneers in history struggled with neuroticism, and that is not an accident. I would suggest taking a personality test that measures your strengths, interests and values to get a sense of your positive sides. Try taking the strengths assessment on you might also, like some of the other assessments generally, the content focuses on our best features is pigeonholing people.

Title: Alone.
Thread
I have suffered with depression from I was, but it is been shakey. I am fine then I am suicidal in the space of a day I am now, and I have recently feel into a deep depression it the worst it is ever been. I have stayed off school because of no motivation and just wanted to stay in my bed with the duvet over my head to block out the world. I have pushed away the few friends I have and now they have actually gone. I do not know what I expected. Of course they were going to leave if I pushed them away and isolated myself from the world. Now, my depression is worse because you can say that people do not care about you, but its different when you realise that people genuinely do not care about yoh anymore. I have nobody to tell me it is ok. I have nobody to talk to. I have nobody to love me, I have my family, but they have their own problems, and I would not burden them with mine. So now I am alone and depressed, laying in bed all day, wanting to break out of the cycle. But the painful comfort holds me down. I just want to know if anyone has felt this way. Can people share similar experiences? Sorry for any spelling errors?

I am so fucking devastated.

Give it time it just happened. So you have not had much to reflect and process, focus on the things you like to do and spend time with friends. Come back in months from now and ask yourself, do I feel better now than I did then?

Title: I am a financial and emotional burden on my mom.
Thread
I am and my entire life, I have been everything my mom did not want deserve in a kid, I am a chronic liar, because I am always stressing about getting in trouble. I stole money from her as a teenager and worse, I have had depression and anxiety my whole life, and with self harm, suicide attempts, dropping out of high school and college, I am one big disappointment and failure, and I constantly stress her to the brink of her own breakdowns, because she cant figure out how to make me into a functional person. And she is worried I will be homeless one day, which I definitely will be. And because of this, she bought me a house, and I feel awful, because it is just a money pit that I do not deserve, and I will never be able to afford to live there without draining her finances and life. She should be able to live her own life and go on vacation and stuff. I wish she would just forget about me and focus on herself and my successful brother. I am hoping she sells the house. When she is done upgrading it, I am trying to convince her to settle for a trailer for me that way. It takes care of her homeless stressor. But honestly, who the fuck cares. I do not care. If I become homeless, that is what I get for being so fucking useless. I just wish I was never born. I was broken ever sinceI was a little kid.

It is not unfair to cut ties what is good for you is just that good for you although listen to the person its not them it is the depression we often get into states where we become miserable and push people away.

Be more cheerful, im not organized, and I depend on people I loose interest in things so fast it hard to live with a mental exhaustion brain. I do not know how to start

Its just a fake wall. I know its hard to move on because I can imagine it hurt you deeply but be happy by knowing you could never be that mean to somebody and you are a better person than they are. You have your things going on and focuse on getting better in whatever you want to get better at next time. Just smile and say hello, I hope you are doing well.

Pushing away. People who care about you will not just hurt you but them as well. I understand in your mind, you think you are doing them a favour, but trust me, you are not. I have been the person who was pushed away, and it was not good for me at all. I can relate to your need to be loved as I have the same need. I want to be loved, supported, cared for. But I dont have that in my life. What I have is a few friendships and one younger sibling, and they all care about me. They are not the kind of support system I need and have always wanted, but they are the only ones I can find. Some positivity with you need help. And I am hoping a medical professional might be good for you. I just started antidepressants and therapy days ago, and I am trying my best to get better

Title: I had a mental breakdown and now I am embarrassed.

I confusion have a really bad life. For the past years, I have not felt happy once, and life is getting worse. Yesterday, I went out drinking with my friends, and I was very drunk, and on our way home, I started crying and just told them about my every problem, including problems in my familyconfusion. I never talked about my problems to anyone, and now I feel very embarrassed. How can I look in my friend eyes after this?

Oh, I have had the same like twice it is fucking terrible and I still regret it till this day. It really depends on your situation, though.

Title: I do not want to get better. Anyone heard of something like this?
Thread
It is always a recurring issue that my therapist really does not like me for I am diagnosed with major depression, schizoaffective depressive type. Mainly, I take medications. There are two threads in parallel that I feel about my life and myself. A part of me hates feeling sad. Sometimes I am angry and violent and I self harm. However, at the same time, a part of me wants it. A part of me wants self harm wants to be self destructive and likes to experience all this melancholy, sadness, anger, injustice and wants to commit suicide. I feel like experiencing all these negative symptoms is a good and preferred way to behave. Self harming sometimes feels like doing the right thing. Finally, honestly, if I were given the option to get better by taking a pill and all these problems will be gone, I would miss this part of me, this self destructive, suicidal, part of me. I like it. But then there are times when I am really mad and so tired, because I hate it. I just want it to stop, and I really want to die. I am king up my life by liking it, but I cannot feel different about it. No matter how hard I try, I skip work, skip school, skip meeting with people so that I can spend several days in this melancholy and self harming when I am choking myself. I know that I can endure more. But I know that if I do that, I willReally die, which I am okay with in general, but I feel like it is not that time yet, but if it were to happen by accident, I would be okay with that. If you ask me I know this is bad, but I do not feel that this is bad. If that makes sense, I feel this is acceptable it like doing something because you are supposed to, but you would do the opposite.
Comments
I understand what you mean. I think I feel the same way I think I have had to learn to accept that this is in some ways who I am and all I know but that does not mean it is what is right it just means it is all I know I am familiar with it and it is where I go in my head when I am bored or upset. How could I not miss it if I get better some day I do not think I know anything else. I cannot imagine not diving off the deep end regularly, but maybe I will feel the opposite one day

Title: I have not felt anything for the longest time have you.
Thread
Nothing makes me happy, sad, angry or fearful anymore. I do not think I am depressed, but I am sure people on this sub have felt like this way. I used to be so happy and grateful for everything I had. I cherished friends and family the mostconfusion now, I could not care less. I know I sound like such an asshole, but it is the actual way I feel. I had my entire life planned out at moving towards my goals at record speed. I was actually going to do something with my life, but everything in my life became hollow. I smile but feel empty. Inside. I talk to friends and family, but nothing can illicit a response that makes me feel anything I feel like I have lost what it meant to be a human. I do not want to kill myself, but death does not sound so bad. Now, it hard to explain this feeling, but I have given up on everything and nothing provoked this. I have friends that I actually love, family that cares for me. I am a huge people person. If I cared enough, I could actually have a girlfriend, I have everything. But for nothing, I would like to hear your experiences with this. To be honest, I do not see this way of thinking changing for me. But if you have got any advice, I am all ears

Same here recently moved out, got a job and everything is going well but I am soo numb.

Title: Requesting advice.
Thread
Hello, reddit I am fucked up. I dont know where to start, where to finish, but I am totally fucked up in my position in. I dont know why im seeking for help and telling this is to people I guess it would make me feel better. Talking about my self and what im going through as an unknown individual. Instead of having friends and me talking to them about this after that, them be the one who ghosts me for a while. Okay, so I am a lifes been tough lately for me, and I cant stand it anymore since the pandemic started and couid was spreading out and we all got quarantined. I got addicted to my phone until now for the last years. Im this lazy fuck who cant even wash his hands properly, being on social media and killing his eyes and brain while they ask for some rest and sleep. I got even more fucked up when my girlfriend dumped me back in october, after a year relationship of me, loving her, truly and not being that shitty guy who fucked up at the end, she has been stalking, amp, ghosting me with fake accounts, viewing my storys and shit like that. It makes me feel in a type of way that she loves me and still misses me. But I feel more depressed. After that. I dont have a single friend. What so ever, all of my old buddies, where all fake and needed me for their shit, then ditchedMe like I was crap and im scared to make a friend and my inner self dose not want any for some reason I do not drink alcohol or neither do I smoke or take drugs but I am addicted to porn witch numbs all of this stress in me then after it makes me worse I am really fucked up and depressed I dont have any fucking family I dont know where to fucking start I keep saying tomorrow but tomorrow is never the day I dont know why I am even trying to seek for help again I guess this is my last time I am turning in to this big fat slug who cant even get up out of bed and wash his teeth or fucking cleen his place im weighing keg keep eating shit and being shit for the rest of my life and being depressed I dont know what to do anymore im sick and tired of this is

I hear you and I understand it hard. I am glad you posted this, because it is nice to get things out. I hope you feel even a little bit better. Reaching out in any capacity is the first step to getting better or on a good path. Obviously, I am not a professional, so I do not know what advice to really give you. What I will say is this please brush your teeth, please eat healthy food, please lay off the porn. I know it is easier said than done. But the most important thing is taking care of yourself. If it takes all your energy, then so be it. But you are important enough to have your teeth brushed and to be up and out of bed.

Title: Serotonin is fine.
Thread
Hello. I suffer from sad as well as hormone issues, and had my neurotransmitters checked, and they found high histamine, gaba and normal serotonin and dopamine levels. But yet, I am still severely depressed. Has anyone else had this happen? And are there any suggestions? My self care consists of traditional therapy with acupuncture and ayurvedic medicine. Low histamine diet, no gluten, dairy and limited sugar, vit, my vit, my manganese supplement in the evenings work out times a week. Averageconfusion journal and connect with online meetings each week, and various other things, like yoga, spiritual and mindfulness practices. I do work from home, so I spend a lot of time there and with the pandemic, it is not helping. My social life is lack luster to say the least, I am also an hop, which makes things a little more complicated. At times, I am literally doing everything I can. So when I got those results back with normal serotonin and dopamine, I was floored. So does anyone have any suggestions

Title: Youtube videos about depression make me feel worse.
Thread
Does anyone else spend hours every day scrolling on youtube and watching videos for about depression from therapists, regular people, and find it all very unhelpful like nothing that these people say actually sounds inspiring, motivating or life, changing. Its awful to feel so hopeless. Even after watching dozens of videos on the topic and find the people in it unhelpful at best, irritating and anger inducing at worst.
Comments
Remember, no one can help but yourself. Youtube videos and therapists are there to help you understand why your feeling this way, but at the end, it is you that can make the change. Only you. I been feeling depressed last years, and to my surprise, I had severe vitamins deficiency, which caused my depression and lack of motivation. You got this.

Title: Not sure where im doing.

Im years old, I live with my parents and im working a shitty job. I have these overwhelming thoughts of me not being good enough. I get support through some of my team members and one friend. I get support from one manager, but the rest seem to not really care. I know not everyone has to care, but I have been feeling down. My parents are supportive either. They say they are, but they are not shit. Ive been struggling with so much lately that all I want to do is cry, but I cant. My eyes are all dried out. I know no one will see this. An that is why I am kind of explaining it in rough detail. But if this does reach anyone, is there anything I can do, anything I can take to just make it peaceful for a moment. It is so fucking loud in this head and I cannot seem to silence it. Fuck! Im done! Im hoping this reaches someone I really need, someone

Hey, I have worked countless of shitty jobs before I worked my dream job right now you are young and have a lot of time to adjust your life its all about perspective. Just zoom out. Not many people can say that have a job or parents, your situation is not okay but that does not mean it is wrong right now the negatives are out showing your positives and you are right not everyone has to care. The only person who does is yourself you have to care for yourself. What are you doing to change your situation? Are you putting yourself out there? And remember, change takes time. Start small. Give your self small goals. I believe in your friend. Love you gesture medium skin tone red heart

Thread
I am a female who just recently went through a breakup. I have had depression for a very long time, almost as long as I remember. It always comes back around. I was very close to a suicide attempt a few weeks ago, and it scared my friends deeply. They think it is a moment of crisis, but it is more this deep underlying belief that it is my fate. Some days, weeks months a I can ignore it, but it is my default thought when anything goes wrong because the lows are so low, and I have really trietongue sticking out cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry. I have been in intense therapy. I have been on anti depressants. I work out anyone looking from the outside would say I am successful, but I just have this deep emptiness. I just need hope that someone has saved themselves, because I am running out of it.

Title: I am crying.

It impossible to live for years without any romantic experience, I have never hold a girl hand. I am sure I spend the rest of my life alone. Girls requirements are too high for me. I am autistic and suffered a lot as a kid due to family problems, physical abuse, lack of money, lack of mental support when I needed itconfusion. I never recover from it, and I never be a normal person. It incredibly sad when I realise I never keep it simple, stupid a girl or have sex I never be loved. Society treats autistic people like trash. I cry every time I think that all that suffering was not caused by me. We are made to live with the opposite sex. It is infuriating when I realise I never be desired. I am literally a piece of trash. I should have killed myself when I planned a few years ago, I would not have to suffer as much. Then everyone can find their loved one except me.

I know how it feels. I am a girl about to turn and never been on a date or had any crushes like me back. I have lots of mental health issues, so I get feeling like I am destined to be alone. I try to focus on the good relationships I have with a small circle of friends, but it gets really lonely. I have decided that as long as I have an unhealthy relationship with the idea of falling in love, then maybe I am not in a place for a healthy relationship at all. Try to focus on being in love with yourself. It hard and will not fix everything, but it makes me feel better sometimes

I am in college and have always been a very good student getting awards grants and generally performing well academically this changed when my stomach issues began and I was diagnosed with crowns disease though it is believed there are other issues at play too as treatment has not been to effective often the pain is so bad it is challenging to move around and when I can difficult to focus in class with the severity of the pain I find myself lost after years of pain and it getting worse over time as well I thought I would not be here by now I was honestly hoping I would not be but I am alive now with a partner who loves me and shows me a level of care unlike anything I have ever seen before in my life or in the lives of my friends I feel hopeless in nearly every aspect of life and my partner is not aware of the fact that the guilt of hurting them is one of my biggest deterrents but the thoughts continue every single day the pain in all it is severity happens every single day and after years of dealing with this and three years of knowing my partner who has tried their best to support me in every capacity they can I feel selfish because they put everything into helping me I should not feel this miserable because so many people have been such an enormous help through all of this I am just wornThin I barely function as a normal human being anymore. I know I am not alone in this chronic pain and it is impact on people lives is such a well studied topic, and I know people personally who have endured it, but not many who have spent so many years just to get a diagnosis and still have that diagnosis not be really all to helpful in terms of treatment I have been to more doctors than I can count, and I am just at my wits end.

I have always struggle with how I feel. But more recently, I have never felt so low, so alone, so unhappy and a complete failure. I have never had many friends, so do not really have a support network. I feel so distant from my family, even though I see them all the time on the outside, everyone sees me as happy and successful. But the truth is, I feel none of that. I am always the one to solve problems for my friends and family. They can always rely on me, but I myself have nobody to rely on. And right now, I really need that. How can I start to move forward and start feeling something, and maybe building myself a support network

Title: Incomplete idea that might be useful.

I would have actually killed myself yesterday but the logistics made it just complicated enough that I decided to go to work late instead that evening I had this thought that I could go on if I could somehow believe in magic again thus my life would retain proper respect for my dreams and not be merely a machine for others benefitconfusion while also not feeling the disillusionment every time some event or lack thereofconfusion conveys a new level of unlikelihood of achieving my dreams I feel like there is a way to do this, especially since this is the first time I got that close to killing myself I have reached the lowest level in a way so future disappointments maybe will not faze me. I kind of also have this morbid curiosity to see whether I can really live the rest of my and legitimately working and believing toward my dreams and they not happen. It would just be so weird since all the positive talk you hear throughout youth would suggest otherwise confusion. I am sure everybody depression is different. But I thought this idea might be useful to some people feel free to add to my idea or suggest any ideas you have as well
Comments
I think this is an interesting idea. Once you attain the mindset that you are already living in the worst case scenario, any future setbacks just do not seem to matter anymore as there is always a way out. If you can live like that long enough to make your dream a reality, maybe try it as most people can. I think it is important to live for more than just spite or curiosity, though. So try to throw fun things in there along the way. If you can apathy is a double sided coping mechanism, and if you grind every day in a life you hate, you might find that you someday care as little about good things as you do the bad things by the time you attain your dream, I like the idea through this is something I might have tried. Had I a dream to follow an idea? I tried for a short time when I was a kitongue sticking out, cheeky, playful or blowing a raspberry, try to create a safe space or world in your head. When you go to sleep something consistent, something you can go back to, I could never lucid dream. So I was never able to see it in my dreams, but I would imagine a world and friends that I would go back to every night before I fell asleep. If you can convince yourself that the safe space you created is real. It might be enough to justify the hours of monotonous, uneventfulness ofReality.

I do not think this is something to be embarrassed about ink, how your friends are or how they reacted, but if they listened and they are still talking to you, I reckon this might be a chance to actually open up even if it took booze to do it confusion.

Title: How do I cope with the fact that my high school bullies who caused my depression are living their best lives while I am still suffering the pain they have caused
Thread
I know it is not normal to cry over things that happend over a decade ago, but I cannot help it. There were of them in total, all girlsconfusion, and they were very cruel to me. They bullied me for not wearing the latest fashion. My parents could not afford itconfusion. They also bullied me for my hobbies, which are things that are popular in todays age. And before anyone says that they were still teenagers and that they did not know any better, please do not because they knew exactly what they were doing. One of them, the meanest oneconfusion knew how to manipulate the teacher and held a presentation about bullying, and during that presentation she was fake, crying about how she was bullied on elemantery school, and the teacher comforting her about how smart and brave she was for sharing her story. All the teachers praised her for speaking languages. Well, guess what? At that time, I spoke languages and still doconfusion. Not one teacher has complimented for that. Don get me wrong. I am not saying that I should have got patted on the back, but it goes to show how teachers favor the popular students. The other day, I saw the meanest one, and we both recognized eachother. I wanted to quickly run some errands, and I was dressed down. I still cannot afford expensive clothesconfusion. She, however, looked her best, and when she saw me, she looked at me up and down with a smug on her face and lookedAway while shaking her head. I have not seen her years and yet she is still hostile to me and she has not changed one bit. When I got home, I searched all of them on social media and I saw how happy all of them are that has really worsened my depression. I feel like a such a loser and now I am also dealing with flashbacks and also have trouble with breathing in two weeks. I have my first appointment with a therapist any tips that can help me in the meantime.

You have to ask yourself, why would one of them still be mean to you from my experience? And probably many others people that I have met in life that are mean to others are truly not happy. They may try and portray happiness, but deep down, they are probably not. If someone is truly happy, they have no reason to bring others down. It is people who are not truly happy that tend to bring others down because they want them on their level, try to find solace in that.

Title: Anyone else have similar depression.
Thread
My depression comes up in flares. Some weeks, I am so depressed, I pray I die because I am just too scared to actually kill myselfconfusion. And some weeks, I am fine. It frustrates me, because il never know when it is truly over. When I was around, I started having depression. It lasted about years before I got better without helpconfusion. Then it came back when I was lasted about half a year. Now I am almost, and it is lasted about year on and off. But I still consider it to be depression, because one thing can set me off when it starts, I feel like crying from frustrationand. I get so sad. Then it turns into not eating and avoiding people and just sleeping. Anyone else have a similar experience

I can relate I have been in treatment since I was I am almost now I was doing really well for like a year and half but then there was a downfall also all these meds made me gain weight so I have been very self conscious too.

Title: It going to get worse I know
Thread
Trigger, warning mentions of self harm and suicide. There is only about a week left until back to school, and I already hate it. My depression got way better after winter break came, but soon it is going to get way worse than it was before. Cannot wait to panic every time a teacher asks you a question, cut my thighs in the bathroom stalls. Try not to cry in class, get headaches and stomachaches for no reason. Think about suicide methods in class, deal with teachers and their shit deal with other students and their shit lose all my interests and so on. I going to a new school. So I going to have to decide whether I going to try to be social despite my crippling social anxiety or just be the quiet kid

Having been in your position, I would say, just do the work to the best of your current ability do not draw attention to yourself and wait for school to be over in years. If you only do what you feel like doing, you will have more energy for when you do feel like doing stuff, it should get better after school, because at the very least, you have the freedom to leave situations that make you unhappy. I am guessing your headaches and stomach aches are stress related unless you have other issues. Apparently, it is not normal to feel like that. So if you are not getting help already, maybe look in to

I feel the same. I quite like baths, but it now seems like too much time to sit and reflect on how hideous my body is. Unfortunately, I do not have a magic cure. I guess you could try to read a book or play on your phone. I try to see everything that involves looking at myself as a process I just need to get through.

Currently thinking about killing myself and I am not saying it just to get treated different or get attention, but I just really do want to kill myself. The thing that gets ne out of bed in the morning is to let out my dog. She is the only thing I have left that is truly there to support me and love me no matter how much of a fuck up I am, I put on clothes because I hate the way my body looks. I would change the way it looks if I had enough motivation. The only reason I got to school is because I have, too, or they will send me away from my dog and make my life worse. The only reason I put a smile on for people is to make them not worry and not push the last time I let them in and talked to them. They were doing it because they felt they had to and it would make there ego higher if they can say they helped me. Then I got home and eat, because the pain of starving myself, trying to change how I look was to much. And if realized I fucked that up too, then I go play games, hoping that my only friend is online that truly makes me want to live another day. If he is online in play, if not in, go, lay down with my dog and try to go to bed, I cant sleep because I have adhd andWhen I have something to do tomorrow I cant sleep which is everyday because of school so I go smoke weed to try and sleep still takes about a hour but it gets me to sleep then I wake up about a hour later because my headache get so bad my nose will bleed and make my eyes hurt and twitch I wash my face off and head to bed without taking alive because I tried to kill myself one those pills I can usually fall asleep in minutes after that then hours later I get woken up by someone taking my dog out of my room then I smoke some more weed to go back to sleep without my dog then I wake up in more hours by my mom yelling at me for smoking weed even though I tell her it calms my headaches and helps me go to sleep but I still get called a worthless piece of shit and that I am a liar then I lay in bed getting ready to start the day all over

I just turned, and I am getting more and more frustrated with this. I have never had a girlfriend. I have always been afraid of girls, too, but I just feel inadequate when I compare myself with other men my age, who are tall, strong and chiseled, etc. Whereas I am short and babyface, I just feel like I have no real way of competing with other men. This naturally breeds resentment and envy of those men. Seeing a tall and attractive men. My age, or even worse younger than me, grinds my gears severely. Even when I look at this objectively, I cannot see a case in which a woman would choose me when given other options, at least I am working hard to get myself into a good financial situation. The only way I can see a woman choosing me is if I am considerably more wealthy than my peers.

Title: I lost all interest in absolutely everything what to
Thread
I am currently taking my sertraline. And ever since I started the meds, my interest in daily life, activities has gone from semi bad to really bad. I have noticed. I also think a lot of how people perceive me and it drains me off all my energy, mainly just overthinking a lot. I might add that I never had this problem to this degree before, but it started to get a lot worse. Ever since I took magic mushrooms twice, I feel like I have lost the sense of who I am. It is quite scary, like I am losing my mind or something or that my personality is gone. I tried to explain it to my doctor, but she does not seem to understand it at all. And I told her that it started after my drug use and my overdose on benzos vodka. I have not touched any drugs at all for about year. Now, except caffeine, I feel like I will never return to old self again as I struggle to define who I am. But it is so hard since I have forgot a lot of my past and what I even experienced, will there ever be something that can heal my brain in the future? If anyone want to chat, I am up for

From which yonder roads? Shall I take one wrong turn could be the last mistake from this perpetuated cycle.

I could finally be free from this cycle, but no, that is not in the cards for me to forever walk in circles I foresee, but a passing thought is all it will be to wander endlessly, waiting to be free. The last path leads to the end of this adventure to snuff the barely sprouting seedling to end the narrative and begin anew

It is okay to need a break. It is okay to set boundaries. It is okay to put yourself first, and sometimes it is necessary to do these things. It can be difficult to take the steps we need to in order to maintain our mental health, especially if we care for the person who is having this negative impact on our life. But there is a reason that in an emergency, you take care of yourself first. This is exactly the same, but often slower. In order to help your friend and yourself. You need to do the following things. Take your time to compose an answer to how something said or done makes you feel it is more than okay to respond to something later if you are unable to respond to it in the moment. And I would say that it is necessary to do so your friend can not read your mind, but more importantly, you can not address the problem by yourself finding out why your friend might have said or done. Something can be beneficial in these situations, but is not always necessary. I do not like it when is said because it makes me feel is perfectly fine, all on its own. And secondly, if something your friend does has a negative impact on you. Think about how you can mitigate the negative impact. Sometimes the only thing you can do is cut contact. Sometimes the solution lays in simply asking that person not to engage in a particularBehaviour. And sometimes you can find a way to deal with that situation that makes it less stressful for you. For example, I am often the person that my sister rants to. This drains me mentally, and I can not cope with several hour long calls a day. So when I feel myself reaching my limit, I excuse myself. If I didn, I would be unable to push myself past that point during times when she really needs me. However, if your friend can not be equally respectful of your needs, it is time to seriously consider whether it is worth continuing the friendship. Sometimes people we care for are bad for us, and while it hurts, we have to do what is best for us.

Sometimes we need to move on from people who are damaging to our own mental health doesnt mean they are not special and that you did not or do not love them, but you need to put yourself first and find people who are mentally energizing to be around, not draining.

Title: I think I got depressed because of my girlfriend condition.
Thread
So my girlfriend is really sensitive to noises about years ago we started working at home because of the pandemic and life simply became hell she could not stand noises from the neighbors anymore I cannot even write about all we have been through since then it is too painfull just to remember it all everything I have tried to do to help failed and now I just feel hopeless and that life has no meaning aside from my job as an employee at a company now I also work as a freelancer total hours of work a weekconfusion because the only thing I can do to help is saving all the money I can for us to buy a new house somewhere quieter for her but it will be at least more year doing this to save enough I cannot survive one more year doing this I am exhausted. We do not have any fun moment anymore. We do not go out, we just stay all the time in the apartment working and cleaning stuff. She is isolating herself more and more. She complains constantly everyday about how the day is being hard for her because of the noises, and I do not know what to say to her anymore. Some days she has panic attacks other days she starts crying and there are days she starts hitting the walls with a chair to annoy one of the neighbors back everything I try to say hurts her even more. So I just stay with myMouth shut and hug her when she allows me to. The only thing she wants to do together to forget about her situation is playing videogames, but I am so sick of it. Everytime I play with her, it feels just like an obligation. For me, I feel extreme anger, sadness and resentment. I just wish we could have our life back, because what we are doing now is not living. I have been on medication until january, but I quit taking it because I just felt numb and felt like life was not real anymore. Also, I did not want to see the doctor, only to take the prescription from july onwards. I have been doing psychoanalysis, but I feel it is so draining, and it is making me question myself to the point. I do not know who I am and what I stand for anymore. I am suffering so much. I do not even know why I am writing this here. I do not want any advice or anything

Have you tried smoking cannabis with her? Was in a toxic relationship with myself before and did not know to get out of it with my new girlfriend. We usually smoke a night. It allows us to relax and just laugh about. Things that became difficult to talk about are spoken about rationally, with curiosity, as opposed to just screaming matches. Not sure if cannabis is the reason why I never agree, but it definitely helps with the rampant emotions might get some hate for suggesting drugs but this is just my personal experience happy face or smiley

Ugh! I hate that type of girl. I know it may not look like it, but deep down, those people are really insecure and fragile people. They re not even aware of it. They have to do whatever they can to feel good about themselves. It really hard not to hate people like that. I do, but I realize they are screwed up. One of the most frustrating parts is that they fool so many people into thinking they are nice. They also find similar people to be friends with. My sister has a mean girl side, but she covers it up to everybody but family. It so frustrating because people think she is nice. I think she actually wants to be nice, but she is too immature and insecure to actually be genuinely nice. She does not really know what nice is. I wish you could be happy. You are not like them. As far as I am concerned, the fewer people like that in the world, the better I hope you feel better hugs,

Comparing your life to them after all this time certainly is not helping, accepting everything that happened and moving forward with stoicism and living the best life you can is the best thing you can do easier said than done, I know. But what else is there to do? Well, you can do that or commit murder laughing out loud. Just joking, trying to make you laugh. Please avoid doing that if you canconfusion.

Do you have any friends you can be around with? I am sure your friends care about you. Try to surround yourself with loving people and think about the ones that care about your health.

By caring about what they have to think about you is just letting them to bully you again. Who gives an if they do not like your clothing just roll with your own vibe however much you can afford you are not commiting any crime with dressing cheap. Maybe you will be able to buy better clothes someday in the future. But now just do not let others shits get into ya. She however looked her best, and when she saw me, she looked at me up and down with a smug on her face and looked away while shaking her head so she is still a bully, simple as that, she most likely a jerk to everyone else, too. I got home, I searched all of them on social media, and I saw how happy all of them are. First of all, big of if thats the first thing you do. Of course they would try to convince people that their lives are super awesome and happy with their bullying lives, that what bullies

Shes just extremely insecure and probably depressed herself and therefore projecting in order to feel better about her own situation. Dont ever take anything personally like a something year old or anyone. For that matterconfusion is extremely pathetic to be bullying someone at that old ass age. The best thing to do is focus on addressing the trauma and moving past it. Theyare not worth your time or energy and continuing to let sad, sorry people like that influence your life is definitely not worth it.

That place is truly terrible. If you are different, they have this alien, like instinct to attack you. Every night before school, I try to beg my family to let me stay home, but they do not listen.

I am so sorry you are going through this. I was bullied too, and I am still suffering as an adult because of it. I hope things go different for you than it has for me.

Title: My mom is the only one preventing me from suicide.
Thread
I am married, but I am extremely insecure and traumatized by previous infedility on my husband part while he claims to be faithful. Now, I still do not feel secure. I am always on high alert and checking to see if he is faithful. If I commit suicide, I would not feel bad for him because I would know he move on. But my mom is the only one I would care about being hurt by my suicide. My dad passed back in october. Fuck covidconfusion. I am all she is got now. We ve always had a close relationship, but she needs me now than ever for emotional support. And as a friend, even on my worse days, when I start fantasizing about suicide, I quickly stop, because my mom pops in my mind. I love my mom too much to hurt her like that. It would devastate her to lose her husband and then her daughter. But I know one day she will pass too. I wonder what will prevent me from committing suicide? Then I can only hope I would be in a better emotional state by then, but I doubt it. My anxiety and depression is only getting worse. As I get older,

I do not believe in the sentiment of religious belief being a preventative or deterrent to suicidal behavior I think that it is the community and connectedness associated with religious organizations that provides this and that the beneficial aspects can be sought elsewhere through communities that hold similar interests or life styles. But to automatically suggest religion as the aspect helping in these situations is extremely alienating and potentially harmful for those with trauma.

Title: I have a son on the way, but I do not think I can wait for him anymore because of my depression.
Thread
I was reading post here at depression, and I thought maybe it would help me if I would post. I do not really know, but I guess it will not hurt to maybe ask help from you guys. I confusion was sexually assaulted by my best friend, confusion, which resulted with her pregnancy. And months ago, I was diagnosed with depression. Our parents decided that it is best if me and my best friend to build a relationship for our son. And I agreed because I wanted my son to have a complete family, something I never had. But the pressure and the trauma has been taking a toll on me, which eventually resulted with me having depression. I am currently in therapy, but I do not think it is helping. I do not know what other coping mechanism is available out there to possibly help me. I am tired, mentally, physically and emotionally, of fighting. I want to give up so bad and finally find peace. But I just feel so guilty to my son, if ever, he would grow up without a father. And I really wanted to raise him. But I do not think I can hang on a little longer. Do you guys have some advice, maybe, or like coping mechanism that may have worked on you? I really want to be there for my son or just make it until I can at least be there for his birth
Comments
That person is not your friend. If you can be there for the child and they are coming into this world without your consent, then, by all means, do what you can for the child, but take care of yourself too. You cannot care for the child without first caring for yourself. I would tell a trusted adult or adults about the sexual assault, marrying this person and being together for the child may not be what is best for the child. Marriage for marriage sake is not always the healthy choice for anyone involved in the family, especially if this person is a sexual predator. Reach out to the trusted adults around you and seek their advice and possibly legal advice. If this was sexual assault or rape, I am so sorry you have to go through with this. But you have done nothing wrong. Reach out to those around you do not have to go through this alone. If you are in school, you may make an appointment to see the school psychologist or school counselor. They can connect you with resources in your area for this situation. Again, none of this is your fault. Be kind to yourself. Throughout this process, all things must pass. Always remember that keep reaching out and looking for solutions and support

There actually is some truth to it. The issue is that a person cannot chose to have faith or not. You either believe or you don. I think that to those who are genuine believers, it can certainly help to those of us who aren it just sounds stupid.

I have this weird thing where I think about a time years ago, the music, the food, the atmosphere, and I get so obsessed, because I love that time so much, even though it was such a weird time in my life, I get depressed, thinking I am now not where I want to be. But only years ago, I was in a real comfortable spot, not an optimal spot, but it seems comfortable, and I really reminisce about it, and I do things like listen to the music. I did try to figure out what shows I was watching with documentaries I was watching. Turns out, this is called nostalgic depression, I believe, and I just need someone to talk to. Does anybody else go through this type of shit they are underlying drug problems as well? This here is nothing there is so much more to it, but this is the gist

In addition to all this, I have become suicidal lately. I always thought things like, oh well, I would be better off dead, or things would be easier if I am dead, but I have never actually wanted to carry it out and thought about how I would carry it out until this year, when I turn it nuts. I am giving myself till end of. And if I do not feel better or am closer to where I want to be, I am ending it. No, it is on a cry for help or anything like that. I am just kind of sick of life. And it is weird, because it is not that bad. I got a good family problems with my sister in law and brother that if you are living, pissing me off, depression, moderate drug use, and I am straight up paying myself at the end of this year. If things do not go as I am planning, id rather go out on my own terms

Yes, I am currently going through this when my depression gets severe enough, I start reminiscing about times where I at least felt okay and I do not even mean really old memories. Sometimes it can be a couple of months old last night, I was going through old pictures in my phone, and the best way I could describe it is getting punched in the solar plexus. Most are the memories are not even that amazing, but they still evoked a feeling I cannot describe in words. For example, I looked at a picture I took of a forrest about months ago. I just remember how much hope for the future I had back then. I also looked at a picture of my cats in the summer months ago when I stil lived with my mom. And I just remember how excited and hopefully I was back then. I remember all the podcasts I listened to the job I had, the books I read. I can even close my eyes and smell the air from back. Then, very vidly. And then I open my eyes and I sit in a dark apartment and it is raining and storming outside, and I get this very intend sinking in the stomach. Sorry for my english did not care to write perfectly

And each time I try to connect with people, the sense of loneliness only grows more harsh. I feel like I have been locked in a void.

I have always had a hard time with friends. It started as early as years old, where I just shut myself off from everything, and I still struggle with this today.

Title: Why do I feel this way?

You may call this a cry for help as I completely hate myself. I am in high school, so I live with my parents, but I cannot remember the last time they have said, love you or anything along those lines, even just a hug. I do not know what to do, because I just feel so awful and being around my parents make everything worse. I also cannot ask for help, because last year I did, and it went very downhill very quickly. I use other things to deal with how I feel, which im sure you can guess. A few. I also started seeing an year old, and my parents became very suspicious when they found out I used simple health without them knowing. I got out of it by saying, it helps my acne, but who knows how long before they find out? The real reason why I use be my bigger issue is that I cannot stand myself and everything I do just makes everything worse. I also have been having a lot of problems with the boy. We are not dating. We are in some sort of open relationship type thing. However, I am not seeing other people. Sometimes he makes me feel like shit, and sometimes he is really sweet, but im really lost in every aspect. I even feel like im loosing my friends, but I do not know if that is in my head or the reality right now. Please give me some advice before I do anythingToo dumb. Thank you for hearing me out. I appreciate you.

But onceI start talking to people. I almost forget about it. First person I talked to waiting outside lecture hallconfusion. I asked is this xyz lecture? He said, yes. I asked. What course he is doing? He simply replied, with his course not asking me anything. I asked how he found year. He said, good, clearly he did not want to talk. So I moved on. Second person I talked to was standing on his own. I asked him, what course he is doing and did the same course as me. We spoke for a bit, and then the lecture started after the lecture. We spoke for a bit, and then both went home. That was the last time I saw him. I guess he decided to do the lectures online, which was also optional. Second day I went in same story. I talked to someone never saw them again, asked for his insta, and he said, he does not have it, so I could not really keep in contact with him. Eventually I started speaking to someone, and the conversation was not one sided. This time only problem is we only shared one module, so would barely see each other.

I still talk to one person from school who I met when I was, but this is about once every weeks. Thats it. Otherwise, I could go a year without human interaction other than my family. At this point, I am kind of numb to it. Most days I wake up and wish that I didnt. Im not suicidal by any means, but I simply would not mind if I was not here right now. Guess it is just years worth of feeling that is stuck in my head unable to talk to anyone about, yes, I have a family, but that is not exactly something I want to talk with them about.

Title: Years of loneliness.
Thread
I aged my life was amazing I had friends people to talk to and hang out with at I decided to change schools because my school was terrible I really struggled to make friends at my new school since I was one of the only new people there and the only new person in all my classes everyone obviously had their friendships groups already since they knew each other for years so I just became a tag along to a group who did not really like me I also grew pretty distant from my old friends due to distance all of us being busy with work school we used to meet once a month which became once every months and eventually I was not really that bothered not having friends at my new school because it would only last years and I was hopeful I would make friends at uni in came couid my entire first year at university was online, so it was obviously pretty hard to make any meaningful friendships with people I have never met or really talked to again. I was not that bothered because i, though everyone is in the same boat. And when lectures and seminars start being in person, things will change fast forward to september. My second year starts in person and I go in for my first day at a london universityconfusion with the intention of talking to as many people as I could, I am naturally quite shy because I have a slight accent. But onceI start talking to people. I almost forget about it. First person I talked to waiting outside lecture hallconfusion. I asked is this xyz lecture? He said, yes. I asked. What course he is doing? He simply replied, with his course not asking me anything. I asked how he found year. He said, good, clearly he did not want to talk. So I moved on. Second person I talked to was standing on his own. I asked him, what course he is doing and did the same course as me. We spoke for a bit, and then the lecture started after the lecture. We spoke for a bit, and then both went home. That was the last time I saw him. I guess he decided to do the lectures online, which was also optional. Second day I went in same story. I talked to someone never saw them again, asked for his insta, and he said, he does not have it, so I could not really keep in contact with him. Eventually I started speaking to someone, and the conversation was not one sided. This time only problem is we only shared one module, so would barely see each other. We did speak a lot over whatsapp, but I guess that he had other friends in his other modules since we started speaking less and less. After the first weeks of attempting to make friends, but too many one sided convoy. I gave up and decided to do the rest of my uni online.

Title: Is it possible that depression could be affecting my sleep and overall physical energy that much
Thread
So I am almost sure I am depressed at least since the last month I talked about it with my psychologist and she just told me to wait for my visit at psychiatrist and to try get antidepressants then until this visit I have no other way of support or anything than my weakly sessions of therapy but they are not helping that much like I can vent and all but it does not do a lot for my depression but back to the question I know that depression can cause sleep issues and overall fatigue but I am not sure if what I experience can be a symptom of depression I have trouble falling asleep I always had some issues but it got really badconfusion and I wake up really early so I have to try to fall back asleep around am almost every day I am also physically super tired it is way worse than just being normally tired after sleepless night I have trouble thinking and moving right now I cannot even get up from my chair some of it may be caused because I also had couid around a month ago but my sleeping was fine a few weeks after it so I am not sure

Yes, depression can hinder sleep and make you feel like you have less energy and sometimes body pains. My depression effects sleep alot. So I take antidepressants as well as sleep meds. Have you tried seeing you psychiatrist early

Title: Being the best is really frustrating.
Thread
Does anyone feel like that? Being at the top is kind of unfulfilling and depressing? It just gets really boring, although it really should not. I mean, it should give you some kind of confidence or serotonin push or whatever. But it really feels kind of empty. Even something as stupid as winning in a boardgame sportsgame becomes really depressing. It just makes me feel really uncomfortable seeing the other person lose. So I just start holding back. But that is like putting up a stupid act. I also tend to not talk about similar interests with people, because I am mostly better or more informed. It just makes it really dull, listening to the same things. It also makes me uncomfortable when the other person is really passionate about something, let say, drawingconfusion, and I am just way better. I see them getting crushed by that fact, somehow getting unmotivated by my accomplishments. I do not want that I want them to not give up and become better, but I feel like I am taking their drive away. My only solution I came up with so far is that I put myself into a new set of people who are better than me, so I have some reason to compete again. I am not enjoying winning the competition per se, but rather having to improve myself in order to keep up. I had an old friend who was some sort of a rival to me. I miss those times when we were constantly challenging ourselvesAnd pushing ourselves to the limit. Now he is got other priorities and I understand that, but still does anyone feel that way too

Title: I have a son on the way, but I do not think I can wait for him anymore because of my depression.
Thread
I was reading post here at depression, and I thought maybe it would help me if I would post. I do not really know, but I guess it will not hurt to maybe ask help from you guys. I confusion was sexually assaulted by my best friend, confusion, which resulted with her pregnancy. And months ago, I was diagnosed with depression. Our parents decided that it is best if me and my best friend to build a relationship for our son. And I agreed because I wanted my son to have a complete family, something I never had. But the pressure and the trauma has been taking a toll on me, which eventually resulted with me having depression. I am currently in therapy, but I do not think it is helping. I do not know what other coping mechanism is available out there to possibly help me. I am tired, mentally, physically and emotionally, of fighting. I want to give up so bad and finally find peace. But I just feel so guilty to my son, if ever, he would grow up without a father. And I really wanted to raise him. But I do not think I can hang on a little longer. Do you guys have some advice, maybe, or like coping mechanism that may have worked on you? I really want to be there for my son or just make it until I can at least be there for his birth
Comments
I am a little surprised that your parents and her parents decided that you and the girl should form a relationship. Did you talk about the fact that the sexual act was not voluntary and you feel assaulted by her? Are you expressing your thoughts and that you feel depressed and exhausted? You gave very little information about your life and circumstances. But I would say that if you feel that depressed or suicidal, you need professional help. Staying alive, at least for his birth, will not help your son and will not make a difference in his life. A child needs a stable and present parent. It rather sounds like you yourself are in need of the care and attention that your son needs. You are still a minor and struggle yourself. So right now, you are not in the position to provide that for a child, and that is okay. There need to be plans how to make sure the child has stable attachment figures besides you and the mother, maybe a family therapy or counselor who can help navigate these things would be helpful. Furthermore, you should take care of your mental health in a constructive way. That means getting better, not becoming more suicidal and hopeless. Please, try to invest in your mental health and seek moreconfusion help. Feeling like a martyear or not taking your own mental health more serious will not do any good, not for you and not for the child. Your child needs a stable attachment figure andSurroundings but also healthy bonds and healthy boundaries confusion between its family members as well as generally mentally healthy family members not only your mental health should be tackled on it is own it is linked to the fact that the girl assaulted you and that does not seem to have had any consequences instead you are in a situation where your family wants you or expects you to form a good relationship with her that itself is highly problematic this topic is very complex and I do not want to make any advice here you are in therapy that is already something but see if the therapy is the right one for you seek help from your parents or other facilities and counselors.

Limit yourself to complain about each thing at most one time. It lets you vent, but it does not overwhelm. People complain once, then fix it.

I totally get what you are saying and your feelings are valid however, I do want to provide some insight from the other perspective I am upper class and definitely have a lot of resources available to me, which I am very grateful forconfusion. However, a change in circumstances does not provide me much relief. I have tried lots of things to try and escape the symptoms of my depression, but sometimes that is not possible. Everyone who deals with chronic depression understands the endless cycle, and low points are unavoidable, even though I have lots of ways to avoid stressors and seek treatment a lot of the time my depression is just there for no reason. Its kind of like I know I have nothing to be depressed about but I am still depressed. When one is dealing with situational depression, they are able to identify what is causing it. Whereas some depression just exists for no reason ink just my cents depression is hard for everyone, and we can recognize that without understanding it, happy face or smiley

The phrase is supposed to reflect the fact that at around year, money stops having a positive effect on your happiness. The truth is that you can use it to become more happy after that, but everyone is using it wrong after your financial status is comfortable.

I am here to say that money does not buy happiness. I have struggled with depression for as long as I can remember and have struggled financially through most of my life too. I honestly did not know what having money felt like until I met my wife. She does very well for herself, and we have gone on multiple trips to hawaii, a few international cruises, etc. We have a very nice home and the car I drive is incredibly awesome. Yeah, I have access to very nice things and we go on very cool trips, but overall, I still fucked up emotionally. I even run my own dream company now, but even that is not enough to make me happy. I need things in my life that money cannot buy. True friendship, unconditional loveconfusion, etc. I would trade all that I have in a second just to get my hands on. True friendship and unconditional love money can buy some incredibly fun times, but it cannot buy true happiness that fills your soul there a difference

My best tip is to sit back, put any devices away for a short minute, grab a paper or sticky notes and a pen and just write down what you have to could do when I am in deep. I write the tasks to the upmost detail, such as pee, drink one cup of water, and at times where I am better but need my brain cleared, I write down bigger tasks, such as write so and so essay, go to the dentist on tuesday, writing these things down, especially in a lot of detailconfusion. Allows me to rest my brain and focus on tiny tasks without having to think about anything I read. It do it and tear up the peace of paper, which gives me a sense of reliefconfusion.

Title: My grandmother hates me.
Thread
Hello. All to start. This post isnt asking for help or advice. It is just to take some weight off my head. I am currently living with my grandmother most times we get along, and it is very nice. However, when I miss one assignment, she thinks I am worthless. She does not say it, ok. We can finish it now or anything comforting like that. You know where you are going to end up flipping burgers? Actually, no, they do not hire idiots for that. You will be working with the illegal aliens putting hot tar on roofs during the summer. Even a trained monkey can do that. What does saying that? Do I do not feel motivated. I feel like I am a burden, like I am part of the weight that society does not need. I do not want to kill myself. It is just I do not want to exist it hard. Trying to my grandmother also talked about my dreams of being a game developer. She just thinks that it is worthless dream. I am almost done with it. I had an outburst, too. I told her about her dreams back when she was my age. She wanted to be a horse rider. If my dream is worthless, then hers was just as worthless. I feel like I did something wrong. Yet she puts me through so much what happened to heading down to the park and skipping stones on the lake? I miss those times. Those few happy moments iRemember, I wish I could go back and relive them, but as much as I want to, I cannot ever get those years back. Despite her telling me my dreams are hopeless, and I need to think bigger or something like that, I do not feel bad. I still have hope. No matter what happens, no matter how many times she tells me that dream does not matter, I will prove her that she was wrong, and one day I will finally be brave enough to tell her that
Comments
You re grandmother does not hate you. She is stressed out. She says things out of fear and stress. I do not know how busy your life is, but school has to be completed. And anyone who is been to school knows that unless you have high grades, missing an assignment can cause you to fail a course. Failing a class for some can mean summer school or worse, coming back another year. So I get where your grandmother is coming from missing. One little assignment is not the same as being late for school. It means you skipped many opportunities to complete it. You want grandma to relax, take advantage of every resource to get on top of things at school. If you have depression, causing difficulties, doing assignments, ask a trusted school employee for help. Your grandma is not opening her home to you so you can coast

I have tried to commit suicide a few times by thinking of driving my car into a tree and also hanging myself twice, and also worked out how many sleeping tablets I need to take for it to work and not fail. But I am still here. So that is something I am trying to make things better. And the question I have is, why is it so difficult? Everytime I have spare time, I can think of anything to do that I like, but I just cannot do it and end up getting into bed or sitting on my phone, scrolling twitter, watching the same movies over and over again. I wish I could stop and do something I am just wasting my life and not moving forward. But it is like, when I come to having time, I just cannot do things that I know I will enjoy. I am even doing it right now, and it just hurts

You could try asking friends or family to help you get motivated push you a little to do something with them. I know it is hard for me too sometimes you just do not have the energy yourself.

Title: Can a depressed person take positivity too far as a way of coping?
Thread
I have a friend who is severely depressed and been getting treatment for it. At first, it seems like it is helping a lot as he is been engaging and seemed to have a positive outlook and was openly talking about the depression. Then something changed, and he would only show a positive side. Every photo he posted showed him smiling. Having the time of his life he would wear these positive vibes, only shirts all the time, and every fu post now are motivational speak. We were pretty close til recently. Hes been acting, withdrawn towards me and ghosted me a couple months ago, the depression ghosting has happened periodically throughout our friendship, but never this long, all other times. He ignored everyone. But this time, it seems to be just me like. He publicly urged people to reach out to their friends who may be struggling and then ignored me both. When I told him some of my personal struggles, and when I asked him if he was okay, I have been struggling too, with unrelated stuff, and each time I mentioned it, he just said, be positive and did not truly listen. It did not used to be this way. He continues to be active with positive messages with everybody else, but refuses to acknowledge me? When I called him out on it, could he actually still be in a bad place? And this is just his way of coping. I wonder if he is ignoring me because I am one of theFew people who can see through this. Everyone else seems to just be praising his behavior and saying how inspirational he is to overcome depression, but I do not buy it. I feel like he is taking this positivity thing too far, and it is becoming toxic. I have not talked to him in a while now and do not plan to until he reaches back out. I care about him, but it really hurts how he treated me. On the other hand, I cannot dwell on this if he is not willing to talk. Is there a better way for me to handle this situation?

Depends like it is good to be opportunistic, but delusional is always bad.

I used to go through small bouts of this kind of thing, days longconfusion. I did it because I was incapable of being able to be my own depressed self in the face of others giving me good news or telling me jokes. I knew they wanted to have land. It never became a preachy thing, where I would give advice or share my problems through that lense, though it always felt like an almost emotional dysphoria when it happened. And often it would make me feel almost more insane, shitty than I was already feeling, because the cause of me doing it wasnt anything actually internal to be positive. It would come from fear of reactions and dissapointment, unsatisfaction of where I really was emotionally. I have distant friends and acquaintances who do the resilient positivity thing when talking about topics and problems, and it nauseates me a little for the same reasons it does for you. They dont take in whats being said or what the experience is like, both for themselves and others. I have found to not touch them until they are out of that weird state. Because sometimes it can be too much for them to face things they obviously dont want to. Or can my mothers friend had a saying? Denial is a great place if you can get there. And when it comes to this kind of hyper positive resilience thing, who am I to shed light on their plot holes if its working for them and making themBe able to function. Ya know, it saddens me, but I think its best for them, and slightly so for me, too. I think you are handling it well, as you still sound receptive if he ever does try to reach out again. People like that need time if they are going to break out of it. I ve known many who havent still, and it sounds like youre coming at it with the patience needed. I am sorry that its affecting your friend and you skeptical, annoyed, undecided, uneasy or hesitant.

Depression cant simply become overcome with positivity because the brain of a depressed person does not produce chemicals like serotonin and dopamine. That makes that positive feeling. In my opinion, he is definitely in a manic depressive episode, and using fake positivity to make him feel like he is changed.

Have you heard of the term toxic positivity? If not, you might want to look it up. I cannot tell if this would apply to your friend or not.

Yes, overdeflecting is real. Its best to have a good sounding board, but it is obviously difficult to develop when you are not doing well emotionally.

Nothing aggressive about it. Plain cold facts, money is not the main reason I am depressed, been depressed when I had money, been depressed when I was single, had self esteem issues all my life just unhappy with myself. My point is, money right now would solve a lot of problems for me right now. Would my depression disappear if I was rich? No. But my stress and anxiety would be gone. I could try to live and not merely existing. I have been depressed for over years. I just want to be happy and stress free. So to say, money wont solve. Depression is not entirely true. Money buys dry specialists comfortable living. And as for my family, its not about them. They will be just fine. I just want to help me

Happiness does not no depression for people with chronic depression if you are depressed because of financial hardship than sure, it can pull you out of depression a bit. But money, happiness will not fix a chemical imbalance in your brain. But more peace of mind helps a tiny bit. I was actually just thinking about this earlier today. I was thinking about how my depression is not better now whatsoever, even though I am successful and have more money than I ever thought I would when I was younger, it actually worse. Frown, sad, angry or pouting

Its a matter of access. If you live in the usa, high quality treatment is almost totally dependent on your income. And as most of us depressives find ourselves either unable to work or just able to work part time, fuck, yeah, not having enough money makes depression worse that plus how pathetically shitty medicaid accepting psychs and therapists are also contributes to deepening the depressive hell home. Its my first year ever working full time. And yes, I could definitely attest that the money does not make me any happier, but it definitely does not make me feel as hopelessly depressed as I felt without a stable income, I am still depressed, but being materially comfortable helps a lot

Actually no many people with a lot of money may have depression, it cant buy happiness, but it can buy freedom. Not happiness is something that cones from inside, but not from money. Think you will be happy with a lot of money. Think again seriously.

Maybe it will buy you temporary happiness but can garrentee you that if your depressions caused by anything else then not having enough money, then it is not going to help your still going to have these feelings with or without money. Personally having money helps me suppress it. Abit more.

I agree many sentiments which are purported in modernity are ascribed by peddlers with no real understanding. For example take the phrase patience is a virtue. Is it really is not alternatively pursuing what you value with the utmost gusto instead, a symbol of virtue.

Title: My grandmother hates me.
Thread
Hello. All to start. This post isnt asking for help or advice. It is just to take some weight off my head. I am currently living with my grandmother most times we get along, and it is very nice. However, when I miss one assignment, she thinks I am worthless. She does not say it, ok. We can finish it now or anything comforting like that. You know where you are going to end up flipping burgers? Actually, no, they do not hire idiots for that. You will be working with the illegal aliens putting hot tar on roofs during the summer. Even a trained monkey can do that. What does saying that? Do I do not feel motivated. I feel like I am a burden, like I am part of the weight that society does not need. I do not want to kill myself. It is just I do not want to exist it hard. Trying to my grandmother also talked about my dreams of being a game developer. She just thinks that it is worthless dream. I am almost done with it. I had an outburst, too. I told her about her dreams back when she was my age. She wanted to be a horse rider. If my dream is worthless, then hers was just as worthless. I feel like I did something wrong. Yet she puts me through so much what happened to heading down to the park and skipping stones on the lake? I miss those times. Those few happy moments iRemember, I wish I could go back and relive them, but as much as I want to, I cannot ever get those years back. Despite her telling me my dreams are hopeless, and I need to think bigger or something like that, I do not feel bad. I still have hope. No matter what happens, no matter how many times she tells me that dream does not matter, I will prove her that she was wrong, and one day I will finally be brave enough to tell her that

Just go for a good long walk. It may seem stupid, but walking is the only thing that it is keeping me somewhat sane.

What do you feel will stop this lifestyle, first, financial ability or mental ability or neither? Your post does not explicitly say that you dislike this life. I lived like this for three weeks not in my own apartment, but house, sitting for others. I had nowhere to go, nothing to do, no one to talk to. I do not think I could do it for more than a month unless I was getting paid to. Curious how you feel.

Even if you have money to live on, you could go work a job to have something to do, or even just commit to volunteer somewhere, become knowledgeable in their organization and structure, or volunteer different places each day. So it is not as much of a job feeling.

I do the same as you, but I also like listening to harsh music and fantasy about scary events. So I get adrenaline rushes, which give me a feeling of living. I have never gone a fullday without rushes. I get bored so fast without.

I have quite a bit of money. I feel you having your daily needs met, is frankly debilitating it. The most paradoxical thing I have experienced lately, as long as there is someone I eldersconfusion or something I investment that generates sufficient passive incomeconfusion, putting food on the table and keeping shelter over your head, everything just loses its meaning. Unfortunately, since I am experiencing the same thing, I do not have any profound wisdom for you, but I am finding some remedy on this by performing task everyday for a month. I have been doing this for the last several months. For example, this month. Task is bathe everyday. It may sound laughable to some, but performing a task everyday that you do not normally doconfusion is incredibly hard. I have failed quite a few times in this in the past, but I have observed that I felt better about myself in the months that I could complete my resolutions. It absolutely does not matter what you choose as a task. It can be as simple as watering a small plant or writing lines about anythingconfusion. In a diary, it just has to be a task which you can perform everyday in about minutes, even better if you could do it at a fixed time in the day. I think it has a powerful effect on our psyche and makes us think that our daily life has a purpose

I am sorry you are in that dark place when I am there. I set goals each day, get put of bed, even to go flop on the couchconfusion, brush teeth and keep kitchen sink clean. Brushing teeth sometimes did not happen bad to procrastinate. I am old now, and having expensive, painful tooth work done, I was pretty good at the other. Once I get stable with those, I add other small goals in one at a time. If I do it faster, I just end up back in that dark place.

Can kill myself because the small group of people I actually give a shit about and who somehow care about me would be would be completely fucked emotionally and financially, even though I would finally be free can go inpatient, because then I would lose my job, and we would all be financially fucked. Only option is to keep going until something fucking explodes. And even with therapy, this is unsustainable. I spend every day playing tug of war with my fucking suicidal urges and have a list of specific plans I cannot go through with because I am fucking needed. I have been one step off the subway tracks for over half a year and speedwalking toward that platform for the past few years. Things keep getting worse. I am only tolerable when I drink and or knock myself out with sedatives, the only time my body feels good. And my brain turns to cotton

I am in a similar situation to yours. I feel that there is nothing in this world left for me, and I do not remember the last time I was even happy. The solution that I came up with is to work myself to death. I am going to work until my heart stops. I am now, and I do not plan to see at least this way my family can be well off. When I die, my wife will still be young enough and financially secure enough to remarry. My mom will be able to live out her last years comfortably. I do not have to leave the stigma of suicide with them. I hope that I can work until I drop dead

My boyfriend, confusion, thinks depression is a joke, and he is making fun of me, confusion with remarks about depressed people, and he is literally complaining about my sickness. He knows I am going through a very tough time, and instead of being encouraging about me getting out of bed as if I decide to be in bed. But I literally do not have energy to do anything. I have been on meds for a monthconfusion. He pours a water bottle on me, telling me to stop being a lazy fat ass and do something to fight the depression in such a sarcastic and aggressive manner. No where near supportive or encouraging. He threatens me while im crying, because I am in shock. He is being a complete asshole asking me, is that how you are going to be? And I said, yes, because I do not want to see him since he is being like that. He breaks up with me, then leaves you would think that your partner would encourage you with supportive words or make plans so that you can get out of bed instead of complaining, talking shit and leaving. I do not even know him at this point, but shit happens.

Well, consider yourself fortunate that you found this out while still only dating, not engaged or married. You deserve someone who will be there for you in both good times and bad, not a self centered asshole. It hard enough to deal with depressive episodes without someone else actively making things worse. So he did you a favor breaking up with you. And when he decides to come crawling back, tell him to pound sand. If he has a key to your place, you should demand he give it back along with anything else of yours. You could not deal with just losing, then block his number, block him on any social media platforms you are on and just cut the toxic asshole out of your life with precision and relish, just not mustard, nauseated face.

Unfortunately, the best thing to heal bad breakups is time, just time to forget about the whole thing. I was in a really intense abusive relationship for multiple years. I did not have any friends. All of mine were through him, so I lost all of them. I could not see how bad the relationship was when I was blinded by love. I relied on him completely, and it took everything to leave. It was the most painful thing I would ever experienced, and I wanted to end it all, but fast forward two years later. I do not even remember what it was like to be with him. Cant imagine how horrible that feeling was anymore. The only thing that got me through it was waiting. I know it is unbearable now, but just know that it is not going to be like this forever. Do you not feel comfortable opening up with your family? Having any form of support could help you feel less alone in this? Have you talked to your therapist about not thinking the treatment is working? Maybe it is time to find a new therapist. It is really a trial and error process. How long ago was the breakup? You could also talk to your therapist about medication as well? It could help. Thats really great that you are able to muster the energy to go to the gym and work through all of this. I would bet you would feel a lot worse if you just laid in bedAll day, the exercise is probably helping more than you realize. Just hang on a little longer. I know it does not seem like it, but I swear itl start getting better soon. I am so sorry you are going through this. And I hope my words were of some help, though, having been in your situation before I understand if they are notconfusion, my heart goes out to you.

That is the real question we ask ourselves daily. I love the way you wrote this really spoke to my heart and mind. I am working on finding peace in my own mind, and it has been hard. I started taking meds, which really have helped, but the first weeks were either numb or very mentally bad. It got so bad that I do not have dreams and have not in years. The night terrors really worked me over in. I have discovered that my true happiness comes from helping others, because I know what it was like to not have anyone to help me when I needed it worst feeling in the world. It felt like the world was ending, but it was only a feeling it was not real. I think you are doing awesome and should continue to wonder which is totally normal. But try to find ways to enrich your life through experiences and conversations with people you got this. I am proud of you

Title: Pulling yourself out of a depressive state.
Thread
Hello. My name is milly. I am a year old from the chicagoland area. I just wanted to share how I recently got out of a depressive state so that it can help someone else a little about myself. I have done individual therapy for years now. I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder. I had a psychotic break when I was, and I have had a hospital visit, as well as done intensive group therapy times now. So I texted my sister the other day that I have been depressed for the past days, crying every single day and just ruminating about all the negative things in my life.

But I take my control back when I think about these things differently. In addition, she told me that instead of dwellingOn the negative. Instead of overthinking, I can do something about it instead and have goal oriented thinking. This is how I reframed my mindset. I am single, but it affords me freedom and time. I have more freedom and time than anyone else in the world right now, because I am not tied down in a relationship, marriage or with children, freedom to spend time with my family and friends to work on myself, physical and emotionally and to maintain my relationship with god.

Title: Pulling yourself out of a depressive state.
Thread
Hello. My name is milly. I am a year old from the chicagoland area. I just wanted to share how I recently got out of a depressive state so that it can help someone else a little about myself. I have done individual therapy for years now. I am diagnosed with depression, anxiety and schizoaffective disorder. I had a psychotic break when I was, and I have had a hospital visit, as well as done intensive group therapy times now. So I texted my sister the other day that I have been depressed for the past days, crying every single day and just ruminating about all the negative things in my life. She asked me what I was depressed about, and I told her that I am depressed because I have been single for years. I am not in a good financial spot. I do not think I will be able to move out this year, and my friends have been shitty to me. So I feel alone right now. She told me that anyone would be depressed if I kept thinking about it that way, and that is when it occurred to me that I can reframe my mindset to think about my current life circumstances in a different way that would be more motivating and productive, because either way, these things are happening to me, and it may feel out of control. But I take my control back when I think about these things differently. In addition, she told me that instead of dwellingOn the negative. Instead of overthinking, I can do something about it instead and have goal oriented thinking. This is how I reframed my mindset. I am single, but it affords me freedom and time. I have more freedom and time than anyone else in the world right now, because I am not tied down in a relationship, marriage or with children, freedom to spend time with my family and friends to work on myself, physical and emotionally and to maintain my relationship with god.

I do not know about you, but I found out that fresh ginger and turmeric tea kind of helps me be energized. I drank a cup earlier. I went to the supermarket and then bam! I started to see colours again. I even craved sweet things, which is something that has not happened to me in forever. I do not know could be just me shitting words or there could be something there.

Title: Shit.
Thread
I have been depressed for a couple of years now, I usually know how to handle it, but sometimes things are just too much. I have had a bunch of friends from different friend groups, and I have had great times with them over the years, but recently, they have all gradually started leaving me. I have never been anyones best friend or number one or even two. I am guessing this is why they stray away from me. At this point, I have almost accepted the fact that in the end, when I have moved out and started my adult life and things like school is not forcing me to meet and hang out which new people then I will end up with no one left all around me. I see past friends ignoring me like I am a stranger. All around me, I see people getting girlfriends boyfriends and live happy lives. I feel extremely lonely. I also want to have someone special to me. I also want to have someone who loves me, but I am scared that things will get stale between me and the one I love. If I do end up dating someone and I will lose another bunch of friends. I am terrified of ending up alone for the rest of my life is this my fault for not focusing on one friend group. At the same time, school is hitting me like a truck, and I am afraid that I will not get the grades necessary to getThe education I want, the education my parents and friends are expecting of me. Instead of going out with friends on parties or study at home, I sit by my pa and play games all day, I never feel motivated to do anything, and I feel like my fears are holding me back from getting to know new people. Sometimes I really do want to end it all.

It really sounds like you need to take a rest day for your mental health. Its hard to sit still with everything going on in your life, but I assure you, everything will be okay, what will be will be? We have all lost friends when we do not suit their needs. And vice versa dont reflect it back upon yourself as a bad thing. We grow as people and at times grow apart, and that is okay. Its part of life. Whens it is dark, it feels like the sun will never rise again. And when the sun shines, it feels like the darkness never existed. Stay strong and please reach out to people and medical professionals if feel like self harming is the only way to deal with these stressors.

Title: Despite my countless options, I often find it hard to find fulfilling things to.
Thread
I am sure this is a common point brought up here, but every couple of weeksmost commonly on saturdays, have a day or two where just do not feel like doing anything. I have countless books to read a long list of movies and to shows I have been meaning to get to a ton of video games that have been sitting in my steam library for years, and many unfinished projects. But as I cycle through all the options in my mind, none of them sound fun at all. I end up wasting my days and then getting angry at myself later for wasting so much time when I could have gotten stuff done. This is especially frustrating when I spend all week looking forward to doing something on the weekend and then waste that weekend puttering around or watching stupid youtube videos to pass the time and wait for the day to end. I take two buproprion every day, which has lessened the effect of this apathy somewhat, but it still hits hard about twice a month, and there does not seem to be much that helps. Sometimes taking a nap helps or just forcing myself to start working on a project, and then I get momentum and get interested in it, but sometimes nothing helps. The worst time it tends to happen is from the hours of about to mornings and evenings are generally free of this attitude. I also tend to have a day like this directly after I have an exceptionallyGood day, which is a bit frighteningit. Like I have a finite amount of happiness per week, and if I exhaust it too fast I get a shortage. Is this a normal thing that just happens when you have mild depression or is there a solid solution that can snap me out of these funks? I have recently started exercising more regularly, hoping that would help since I have a remote office job and a pretty sedentary lifestyle. But I have not seen a noticeable difference.

Disclaimer I have not been diagnosed depression, but my of has, which is why I am on hereconfusion. I get those feelings too. Sometimes I just do not even want to get into a show or game because it feels like a lot of effort, even though I can tell it would be fun overall. Then I end up just watching youtube for hours because it feels non. Committal I can stop at any time and not miss out. What helps me is just not being super focused on finding something to do, but rather being more focused on just enjoying my time. I do not care if I spend hours on youtube as long as it was enjoyable. If it is not enjoyable, then it makes more sense for me and thus becomes easierconfusion to pick up the games I have not touched in my steam library or start a new show right now I am crazy, addicted to divinity original sin. It been sitting in my steam library forever, and I finally started it out of boredom. And now it is all I think about. Lao I do not know if that is helpful at all, but at least have the take away that a lot of other people can go through this too. Even people who have not been diagnosed

Your phone will not help you get some change. Get off the bed and start going to walk. No, I mean, get off the bed. Believe me, just walking outside makes you not isolate yourself. Maybe be in contact with some people, and most of all gives you a little walk to exercise. Its very important to walk around. Cus it makes you feel better. Try it one day and do not sit around. Looking at your phone changes comes trough yourself. You can do it, believe me, it worked for me. And a lot of people just make that step. You can do. Dis

Comments
Depressed people usually start performing poorly in all areas of their life, not just with one particular relationship, see, if you can notice troubles at their job, loss, of interest in their favorite hobbies or increasing social isolation, those are pretty significant signs of, if not depression, at least some sort of health decline. Edit also, I do not have relationship experience. So take this with a grain of saltconfusion. I think you should take them at their word if they say it is not you. If they are lying, not being completely honest, that is their responsibility, not yours.

Theres no possible way to explain just how much I do not want to be here in this world right now. I am struggling everyday and logically, I know I should not be having feelings of what I am for the one I am missing, I want them to be gone. I do not want to believe in anything related to this shit anymore, but I made a promise I would not end it until my last pieces of me are taken. The first two were and the third was the only saving grace at being truly happy and not wanting to give up on life. But that one is now gone forever too. Pas boo mueca! It may sound dramatic. It may seem like I am doing it for manipulative purposes, but in reality, I am not. This is who I am honest to your fucking god, I am fucking ready to die already. I have been since

Title: Thought I share.
Thread
Hi this is probably the same thoughts everyone here has, but I cannot stop being depressed. I know one day I will die and nothing will matter. So even if I try to take part in things that could make me happy, it will still lead to my inevitable death is not the only factor that makes me sad, but also how shit my life is I am turning soon with barely any friends. I go out with friends once a month on average, and still then it is not fun. I hate my looks, my time my family I do not share this with anyone else, not because I am scared they will take it badly or that it makes me look stupid. I just simply don. I have not tried methods to cope with depression because I think they do not work. I cried before posting this for the first time in years, just out of being depressed. I do not know what I expect from others by posting this, but maybe it would help me by writing down my thoughts

Hey dude I do not know if I can offer much good advice for your situation but I just wanted to say I read this and I have heard you for what it is worth it great that you chose to post here rather than keeping it inside the fact that you cried for the first time in years is a really good sign it that deeply buried emotion that makes depression a ton harder to deal with when you let it out and talk about it, you are giving yourself more power over it so even if you do not have any faith that things can get better, please feel free to keep posting on reddit a lot of people will blindly assure you that things will get better and they can it weird as hell for some people, it just randomly seems to get better when they enter adulthood take this advice with a grain of salt but if nothing matters then you have the freedom to fuck around with life and experiment as much as you want. You can try as much as you want to see what makes you feel better. And if for some reason nothing helps. You can always tell yourself whatever none of this really matters anyway and it can feel freeing that my take on it anyway. I think this mindset is called active nihilism.

Title: How to support my so during a depressive meltdown and burn out.
Thread
Hi, all I posted in another community. Heres some context. My boo is depressed and burned out. I am becoming burned out too. I hope someone can just listen and hopefully give advice. I am dating my best friend, and our dynamic is amazing. Overall, they deal with depression, and at times, life gets hard for them, understandable, because life is really stressful for us all. But knowing someone has a mental health issue, it can be harder to keep them motivated. Both of us are in therapy. Mine is just to learn about support and supporting myself when we first started dating a year ago, they were fine, and as time went on, they would faced some external struggles causing unhappiness in them. I did a lot by being supportive, sending affirmations, spending quality time and planning dates that they have always wanted. We would even travel to help give some breathing space. I also was the one making sure we have personal time with them, having family trouble, monetary strains and mental health decline. It is been hard. We still laugh and love, however, I can feel everything they feel again. This is my soulmate. We are talking about. Weve been there for each other when appropriate, having other outlets which we encouraged. The thing is, I am the first person everything is told to, and I am always open. Its just that now they are mentally declining. Even with help I have tried doing things to cheer them up, and it is temporary,Often being told nothing feels the same anymore I do not have the energy for anything or feel any emotions myself and our friends watch as they suffer and I have had to watch my wording because of them being overwhelmed at the whole world I have had to be honest about my needs but it sometimes ends in them being irritated and sometimes they snap at everyone dont get me wrong my partner is so pure but I know what depression can do to someone I have tried to crack jokes and sometimes they will not even laugh or read into it as a general thing theyare always confused and it is hard to have conversations because they give up trying to contemplate I wonder how much longer they will be this way and if anything will work I will admit I have been angry and disappointed at times but I know that I love them so much and it is worth working for they still give effort but sometimes their mood gets in the way aside from taking care of myself what can I do I have used these last months researching depression and anxiety in order to be of support this is someone I want to grow old with so I could really use some insight I may mention their mental state makes them spiral and I feel helpless I do not want them to give up on living or worse take their life theyve mentioned not wanting to be here on earthAnymore or that they do not have a purpose I contacted family and friends encouraged talking sincerely to their therapist about it and even called a hotline at some point
Comments
This is something they have to deal with. It sounds like you are literally doing everything that you are able to do at the end of the day. However, it all rests within the individual with the disorder, two bits. For you, sometimes one person can be ready for something the other is not, whether they want to be or notconfusion. And this difference needs to be dealt with or else both parties will suffer. Perhaps look into some couples counseling or invite one another to individual therapy sessions. If the therapist allows, my personal therapist says I can include whoever I want in my sessions as long as the focus is on me

Tell them you feel a bit off and right now no, there is not anything that they can do but when you think of something you will let them know reflect on your current behavior. Am I avoiding conversation calls texts? Am I ghosting events or plans with people? Am I participating? But find myself not really there as that can also be off putting these things happen whatever the case it is ok. And as long as you communicate and try and process and be proactive, you are doing fine.

Title: I need help for my depressed friend.
Thread
Just mins ago, I finished texting my close friend who has tried to commit suicide times already. I try to be present and supportive when talking to him usually, and I encouraged him many times to reach out to professionals, but he keeps refusing and telling me that he does not want to fix what he has, and that death is the only way he will feel better. I am really worried this time because he seemed so down and turned his wifi off. I know him since primary school and now we are. I am pretty sure this is probably the saddest I have seen him. I do not know what I should do next. He asked me to leave him alone and give him space. But I am kind of worried
Comments
He seems to be in a really dark place. And in that moment, it is easy to brush, of all, sort of help. When I have been really depressed, my friends would always stick with me and just do something, maybe just go out and eat, go for a walk, be present, and tell him how great he is, even if he might not listen in the long run, I think that it is absolutely vital for him to get some help. Maybe talk to his parents that might, though, be riskyconfusion, but maybe mainly just try to convince him, and that there is no shame in seeking help.

Title: I need help for my depressed friend.
Thread
Just mins ago, I finished texting my close friend who has tried to commit suicide times already. I try to be present and supportive when talking to him usually, and I encouraged him many times to reach out to professionals, but he keeps refusing and telling me that he does not want to fix what he has, and that death is the only way he will feel better. I am really worried this time because he seemed so down and turned his wifi off. I know him since primary school and now we are. I am pretty sure this is probably the saddest I have seen him. I do not know what I should do next. He asked me to leave him alone and give him space. But I am kind of worried

Unless he wants help. There is not much you can do if he tells you he has a plan to kill himself. You can talk to the police they will bring him to the hospital that the last option I had it happen to me.

Title: What the purpose
Thread
What the purpose of living? I do not know tbe I am. In a few days. I still live with my mom. I do not know my dad. I do not have any friends, besides a few online friends. I met them in real life, but they live too far away. I am spending my days playing video games and jerking off. Mostly, I do not have any money to my name. I do not have a job, and I am studying law. I do not do anything for it anymore. I am not in death since I live in germany. But still, I am living in a constant bubble of disappointment, dissatisfaction and being stressed by the simplest things in regards to my future. I feel like I have all the time in the world, but I also don. I know I should start working out. I know I need to get a job. I know that I should seek treatment, but everything involving others stresses me. I used to be quite smart, but nowadays, I am just a underachieving failure. I am not addicted to any sort of drugs. At least I am gay and chubby. I am not even sure what I can add to people life. I am not suicidal as of now, but I start to wonder if I am not better off dead. I do not know if it will be better in the future. I honestly have no clue. I just do not want to feel this miserable, almostEvery day.

You have your whole life to figure it out, figure out your purpose, meaning of life. All that I am sorry to hear you are not feeling well. I hope you have more tolerable days and then find a way to find a purpose for your life.

I wish I was dead. I want to go home, I want to see my family. I want to be around my own things and loved ones, but instead, I am just hurting all over, and I want to be dead.

I used to post a lot here, especially when I was younger. Im nowconfusion and in a different account. However, I took acid one day, and I decided I would work on myself. And for years I have never seen this sub anyways. My cat died yesterday. My only true friend. Its sad as fuck too, cause all I do is drugs. And I was in the middle of detoxing, used to do a ton of drugs. Now, working on getting off weed and benzosconfusion in one way he helped me a lot. I just wish it would not have been so soon every night, after binging on drugs, he would be waiting for me to sleep on the couch. Now I have nobody to sleep on the couch with, and it hurts a lot. However, somebody in my house needs to keep their head up. I love you klein, I miss you so much. And fuck what anyone says about cats and dogs not going to an afterlife. See you on the other side, buddy, your life was short, but you gave joy to everyone around you, and im sure you are still spreading the same happiness you gave me

So sad that klein died, frown, sad, angry or pouting. Wish you all the strenght to get trough this also remember him and make yourself to always remember him and see the work he has done for you by being there for you and do not fall back in bad habits. Klein believes in you, and so do I am only subbed to this topic to hopefully give people a heads up that they are loved. And I want to share positivity also to you wish you the best youl get trough this pain. But remember, its fine to feel this right now. And to grief again, my condolences and be well soon.

Title: I need to vent. Im about to blowup here.
Thread
I want to break stuff, scream, im shivering. I want to hit things so hard that I myself get broken. This is what I feel right now. Normally, this feeling comes and goes. I easily get distracted. My head is boiling in, thought. I dont want to die, but I dont really need to live, either. I am not afraid of dying. Im like meh a little about me. Im a norwegian year old, married dad of, and confusion. I have a well paid job, a great wife and great kids. We are building our dreamhouse, and I feel like a huge failure. I feel like the worst husband, dad, employee, colleague in the world. I feel like I am never good enough. Even if my kids tell me they love me. My wife tells me she loves me and that I am more than good enough. Even if I get good reviews from my bosses and colleagues, I feel like shit. I always have. My head have always boiled in thoughts, especially after social interactions. I used to be very extrovert. Now, im more an introvert, just so I can do not have to deal with the constant reliving of all the conversations I had, breaking them down and trying to figure out if I said something stupid if I was too distracted to listen to the other person. Did I drift of? Did the other person really wanted to talk to me or not? And so on and so forth analyzing every last wordOf every sentence at this moment. Im alone at home, while my family is at my in laws im alone, just me and my thoughts, the danger zone I have tried to distract myself with, wow, that usually does the trick. But I think the upcoming therapy makes me nervous and extra sensitive. Tried coding the one go to hobby that takes all my focus away from everything else and channels it into vscode and stack overflow. What is wrong with me? Im tired of feeling like this. The constant churning in my head I used to love that. I got super interested in what ever stole my attention. But as I have become a grown up, I feel like that is not an acceptable way to behave. Sorry for the moaning just needed to get it out there
Comments
I feel ya feel the same way except, do not have a family of my own yet want one, but just have not had the opportunity yet, haven met the right person. Every thought, everything, conversation, everything that happens, I overthink it. Regret decisions I could have made better regret decisions and opportunities not taken. Look for ways to relieve the stress and pressure, turn to the old rum bottle, but it does not help. And yet, I still do it. Try not to think about upcoming situations too much easier said than done. I know that we spent years building a house, and yet I always feel nothing is ever right. My current family, that is, everyone, is always stressed and complaining about something sucks. Keep your head up, and hopefully everything works out. Good luck and greetings from uk is I am drinking right now, do not even know if any of that helps or has any meaning, but I hope it does

I have started to lose friends because they see me as negative. And because I vent a lot, I feel like the only way to repair these friendships is to become more positive. But it just does not come naturally to me I am bitter, critical and depressed. How do I change and not let depression cloud my view of life
Comments
I will say I dislike being around negative people alot like sometimes you just want to share laughs with someone not therapy sessions I knew someone cool guy but everytime I saw him, he always has some issues going on and I would hear about it I just distanced myself after awhile my suggestion is to exercise daily and re correct those thoughts to glass half full whenever possible. Some herbs help with stress and mood rhodolia. Rose has a great effect on mood and anxiety keeping a journal and just going on. Rants may be helpful. Nothing wrong with being open and honest. Sometimes I do not think debbie downers are fun to be around. Alot of people even hate super positive people because misery loves company, and some people are envious. So be you just do not pile only negative on people

Title: I do not think I have ever been happy.
Thread
I have been doing some serious, reflecting recently on my life. Of course, my memory is shitty, though. I have been trying for a while to remember a time in my youth when I was happy, but I honestly think I have been depressed my whole life as a kid, I was constantly anxious, afraid of people wanting to please everyone. Even as a fucking small child like kindergarten, it was hard to make friends all through grade school. Even now, it is hard, but I know how to fake it to make it. I never really dug into my past. I just thought I was just being pessimistic as teenagers usually are, but I legitimately think I have never had rest from constant anxiety. And if not that, then crushing depression, it really a miracle I am alive. I think I am hopeful for something, but there is nothing out there. I have the energy or nerve for I want to create art and inspire. I am inspired, yet I cannot, for the life of me, force myself to work. It causes intense anxiety and sadness, etc. On top of that, I am fucking numb, and all the other complex issues you get with anxiety and depression that has not been treated for years, the people I live with do not understand. It takes more than a few months, let alone a year of therapy to get better. I do not have a normal state to draw back to, and that is just utterly horrifying.And depressing to me. I never had a childhood, at least not one that I could enjoy as a child would I acted as much like an adult as I could up until I actually became one? I do not even care if I had the chance to turn back the clock. I have no hope. I do not know what the point of this was. There is a lot for me to complain about honestly. I just wish I was not depressed so I could pursue my dreams and have a reason to get out of bed. It hard to leave my room, go outside or leave my bed. When did it get so bad, or has it always been like this? I have no idea what to do. I know I have to summon the strength within me to care and try, and I do care a bit, but it just feels endlessly fruitless and pointless. I do not have the will or emotion in me to care anymore. Funny enough, things have been better for me in the past few months, at least I think I am never sure it still hard to even exist. I do not know why I am alive yet. I cannot kill myself. I wish I could to do. I am super fucking depressed, and I cannot recall a moment in my childhood where I actually had happiness or enjoyed myself. I had no friends, extreme anxiety, etc. It might be because of my awful memory, but itIs gotten better in the past few months it being my memoryconfusion. What do I do?

Title: Rant about the hypocrisy of society in my eyes.
Thread
Why do people tell people to reach out so much? And yet, when we do its to silence, they guilt trip us into living because they enjoy life and cannot see it from out eyes, then they alienate us because we are not positive energy. Thats when we find out that being depressed is not what kept us alone. The lack of tolerance for the same people society claims to care for is then we hate ourselves, nore for being farther and farther from what life deems human nature. Humans are social creatures. I have looked everywhere trying to find a counter argument, but I have had no luck. Why spread this misinformation? Maybe because its true. Human beings are social creatures, but they are not compassionate, not at all. If the rock posted about suicidal ideation, there would be an outpouring of sympathy, but I do it and lose. Friends get ghosted and ignored, while the same people I used to call friends post on social media to them, I pray they experience this abyss, this never ending cloud of apathy. Heres to hoping I haunt, broken a rule. Every time I ever post, it gets taken down, happy face or smiley

The thing about these negative emotions, besides what they do to you, is that they are contagious. Opening up to people was the worst mistake I have ever made. Just a touch of the black void inside me was enough to get them so distraught that the situation became about them. Instead of myself. It easy to care and cry about someone after they die, because, you know, you will never have to do anything for them. Kinda like procrastinating till the last hour before an exam, then saying, oh, well, it is too late to study. Now we re hardwired to ostracize the weak for the betterment of the pack.

Title: How are you supposed to go on?
Thread
Temp account for obvious reasons. I have gone through nothing but turmoil all my life. I was born to a shitty place with a horribly dysfunctional family abused and bullied by my peers, rejected and ostracized, despite my best intentions and multiple attempts of bettering myself shouldered responsibilities. I have genuinely seen grown men break under as a teenager done it without thanks or support, only emasculated, ridiculed, mocked, disrespected, unappreciated and hated. I finally broke. I have not been able to function for months. Now, the responsibility is still on my shoulder, though now it stands on a broken back. I feel like I have nothing to lean on. It feels like I could have maybe leaned on having a good social circle to cope with everything else or maybe been able to peruse my now dead passions to escape from everything else. But everywhere I look, I see horror and feel nothing but pain. At years old, not a night has gone by since I was, where I have not begged god to take me. It seems even he, in all his wisdom, has elected to abandon me too. The help of professionals is beyond me too. Due to location, economical situation, I am not looking for sympathy. If you have nothing but kind words to offer, then I kindly ask you to keep them to yourself while well intentioned and appreciated. I am looking for actual advice. How are you supposed to spend the rest of your years truly and completely broken.

You surround yourself with comforts and give yourself things to look forward to no matter how small I have felt the same way since I was years old and I am now the best advice I can give is to find something anything that brings you joy and hold onto it and never let it go live for it doesnt matter what it is either there is no shame in doing what you have to do in order to survive one day you will wake up and you will feel alive and not merely just surviving

Title: Been almost a year since diagnosed and treated for depression. Here is my story, I guess.

My depression started out of the blue I was dragging for a year an addiction to weed smoked every night. When that ended, boom, depression. I had suicidal thoughts. I cut myself several times, cried every night to sleep, felt dead during the day did not want to do anything, could not find meaning in anything at all, etc. Fast forward, I start taking an antidepressant, then another one and another one and another one, then antipsychotics, yay. All of this, of coursed, served with clonazepam. Also, I spent a month in a ward for cutting and stuff. Has it worked? I do not think about killing myself anymore been less existentialistical english, not my languageconfusion have more energy in general, but I still feel shitty about myself that what killing me today feel shitty about the things I do about my life. I have the constant temptation of not doing stuff cause it will not matter twink or smirk. Depression sucks dicks

I know I am pessimistic. You do not need to remind me it sucks that a lot of people are looked down on simply because of how they think. I think that should not be a concern for you, though, besides, that person may even have a reason as to why they have a negative mindset. So do not just make assumptions, ask how they are feeling and listen. And if you are a positive thinker good for you just do not shame others for not being one.

I am struggling right now. My boyfriend is usually very sweet and talkative, a pretty energetic and bubbly guy. He used to come over every night and we would talk about our day chill on the couch and cuddle in bed. About a month ago, he started seriously working on a research project, and the deadline was earlier this week, the project fell through, and he is felt pretty depressed. Since unfortunately, we have not really seen each other much in the past weeks because of this project. He still has another project due this tuesday. Hes displaying some depression symptoms such as loss of interest, irregular sleeping and eating habits and depressed mood. I recently caught couid and I am quarantining by myself, which is definitely contributing to my mood. But ive noticed that he has not been saying, I love you or babe, and only says, I miss you. When I say it, I sent him a doordash meal for his dad and him today, and he told me how much he appreciated it, but still did not say those things I am feeling at a loss, because I cannot see him while quarantining. And I do not want to ask him a bunch of silly questions while he is working on this project due tuesday to do. Is he just depressed and going through things or does he no longer love me anymore?

First, I hope that your recovery is going well, and I am sorry to hear you experiencing that depression can cause a lot of changes in someone is actions. My so is deeply depressed, and they often also talk to keep up appearance, so I do not feel pushed away. Many people suffering from depression do this and they do not really mean to cause harm. The best thing to do is to take good care of yourself. And when the time is righttell, your partner about what you have been feeling and be gentle, itll help the flow of the conversation communicate honestly and see what is said. Go with your gut and feel him when he speaks. Try making sure that you are in a good head space as well. Cheers,

Title: I have never been so down
Thread
I need perspective from a girls pov. I need some real advice. And il try to keep this short. Met a girl years ago, things kept coming up. She would be with some one or I would be. We always kept in touch through the years, and it finally happens. We both had our shot at each other. Its the happiest I have ever been. I have never connected with anyone more. She slowly tore the walls down, told me I am safe, and I gradually let her in until we agreed to enter a relationship. And life was perfect talk text all day, constantly hanging out. I was smitten. She does have a two year old but told me over and over, she could not stand him, the baby, daddyconfusion and I have nothing to worry about there. So I believed her one morning, I get a good morning text, and I replied fairly quick with, in min, expecting the message and nothing kinda strange given how things have been. But she is been getting over couid, so I chalked it up as must be resting. After a few hours, I tried again, letting her know. I hope she getting some rest and feels betternothing, tried, calling a few hours after that before turning in for the night. Nothing tried. A couple of different platforms. Message goes unseen, but I can see the green dot on her name. She is active. We did not snap much. But I tried there because at least I knowIf she saw it would say open and could not see from the drop bar. And after a week I see the open blue triangle. And nothingthis girl has said how she always thought I was the one and loved me over the years. So for the sake of fighting for it, I gave her one last call, one ring and voice mail. I am blocked. We never had a fight. All text seemed enjoyable and fun. I do not understand what happened. I know her baby daddy was not happy. She was seeing some one and I get saving the family if she went back as I have a kid with some one else too. But I am utterly heart broken. I took her off all socials because it was to hard to see her on but not respond. And I really believe she loves me. Is this a fight worth pursuing? My brain says she ignoring all messages so leave her alone. But my heart wants to keep trying.

I am did not finish high school be. I dropped out in senior year after repeating a semester, and I finished on a ged. Dont know what I am studying, and my parents are waiting for me to get into college. Its not like I am a victim here. I just spend my days playing video games and doing nothing. I have no energy to anything whatsoever. I eat way too much. I am pretty stupid and have no prospect of what to study or what I want to do for the rest of my life. Its astonishing to see what my life is right now compared to how I wanted it to be. And I did not really plan it at all. I just did not want to become a loser. And that is exactly what I am. I fear I am going insane and have been having suicidal thoughts almost every night for months before that. It was intermittent, but now it is every night I have nothing in common with anyone, my age nor my friends. They are all in college or working, and I am just a bum loser who will probably kill himself in a few years.

Plainly put you are so fucking lucky to be, please write a list of things you want to start improving upon and do them gradually you have so much time. I am almost. And if I had one thing to say to someone years younger, it would be to do not be naive to how fast time flies before you know it. Youl have regrets. But man oh, man, you are. Start the little things now to improve yourself. Fuck the grades and shit they mean nothing. Please believe meconfusion play your video games, but start to spend time doing other things. Aswell I have in common with of my friends, and I am ok with that. I take pride in it. Actually, I would not want to be like everyone else, sometimes lolconfusion. You are wow, so young, so much time. Give it a year or. And youl wonder why you even worried about this stuff? Thats if you start making the small changes. Small steps. Confusion. Happy face smiley

Title: I feel like a worthless bum.
Thread
I sitting in my parents house right now eating their food, drinking their drinks, using their electricity and using their car. All because my mental health is so shit that if I am alone, I go into full blown panic mode. I miss my apartment in the big city so much, but now I am stuck back in my small ass hometown, surrounded by all the same people I wanted to get away from moving to the city. And starting college was probably the number one milestone of my life. As I struggle with dyslexia, having that taken away is seriously heart breaking. Its one thing that I am temporarily withdrawn from college, which is paying for my apartment. But the whole time, I have been at my parents close to a year nowconfusion, I have been unemployed. Granted, I have very serious mental health conditions and a fairly serious lung condition, but I do not see that as an excuse anymore. I am just weak. I am a bum. I would easily move back home and get out of their space if I had a car. But mine broke recently. So now I am literally stuck here. I seriously do not have the strength right now to have a job. So I am stuck being a bum, too. I am hoping that with some of my college funds and more help from my parents, I can get a new cheap car soon and move back. But we are all tight on money, and I doNot even have a job, and it is not their responsibility to buy me a car. They already have bought me one before. All in all, I do not know how long I am going to be stuck here. I do not think I can take much more. I have been filled with massive guilt for so long I feel unworthy of being alive. I really wish there was a painless way to finally kill myself.

I cannot see a future where I will still be sane if I keep living like this. I do not have control over my environment. All I have control over is me. Everyone tells me that I just have to wait until I am, and then what I have to process this trauma while I move out, pay bills, go to college. I may be away from the people who hurt me. But being an adult comes with a lot that I am not ready for. I can pray for things to change, but I should not expect things to change. I do not want to die, but I cannot live this way anymore. I wish I could just be erased from existence

In high school I did not just get bullied I got jumped for being hispanic, but looking white. No joke there I am pounds getting jumped by a group of black girls and guys girls were about like guys were like I just turned myself into a ball. Ambulance was called after I had broken ribs and bruises all over they did not expel the students, but I did not care to report them. Other people did. So I just dropped out and did homeschool instead and did not have a real high school experience, which was nice but was really isolating. Spent too much time at home with a different kind of bullying. But then I met my of at cause he was my neighbor. And then after, once I was, we got married, it messed me up for a long time. But I do think it happened for a reason. It sucks, but teach us perseverance and that we are stronger than we think I do not know. Maybe

I am a year old female and a loser with no friends or social life. I have had friends in the past, but I either pushed those away after realizing how much worse they made me feel or they ended up leaving me for making small mistakes. Everywhere I go, I get ignored or made fun of because I am different. No matter how hard I try to be normal and likeable boys only use me for sex. I am good enough to sleep with but not good enough to date. My father is mentally and verbally abusive, controlling and makes me feel even worse for being different. It hurts so much living this way everyday. I hope that life gets better, but it just gets worse. Everything and everyone I love gets taken away from me. I have been thinking about suicide a lot recently, but I cannot do it because I do not want to hurt my mother. It is like I am forced to be stuck in this terrible life of mine. I really need some help. I have talked to multiple therapists, but none have space for another patient, or they just do not think they would be able to help me. I just want to feel like I am worth something. And like I am good enough, even if I am not like other people, my age

Title: Why do I feel this way?
Thread
I am a I am giving reddit a try and let out. I never classified myself as depressed until recently. I read the posts and what depression is, and I look at myself with these same symptoms, and I am depressed, heavy. I feel like I should not even feel this way, though my life is not total shit. I am living today because I have a bed, a house provided by my fatherconfusion food to eat everyday, provided by my motherconfusion and just all around able to do and live anyway. I want yet, I choose to stay at home. Most of my days eat heavy, cannot sleep until and wake up at play. My games hop on reddit, and everything goes full cycle from there, I obviously need to change this routine, but it is so exhausting everything seems that way. Even before this, I have been in the house for almost a year. My father telling me to go out and go to work again. But I hated that feeling of work. I only had jobs after graduating highschool. My brother immediately put me to work at a warehouse where I worked years there, driving a forklift, handling heavy freight. I had the night shift, and it was a part time job, while during the day, I went to school for hvac. After getting my certification, I immediately went to work for a refrigeration company. I was working long hours, mostly from to. It was a good job, very good pay, and theCoworkers were really cool. I did not like the bosses, though, they would talk down on me and act like douchebags. It never got to me. I just continued my days. But the last day with them, they wanted me to drive to tennessee and drop off materials for a costco construction project. No problem. I never been that direction of driving before. So it is a new experience for me to head over there. I completed my objective, and I am now heading back for a hour drive. They call me cussing me out, saying, I never delivered these paychecks, even though I did, and left them at a specific spot and told them where it is, but they cannot find it. After I returned from a hour drive, I went to the office and said, hey, thank you for the opportunity. But I am done and left immediately after I quit, because I was so tired of working. I worked too much with no goal. It feels like all that work was not something I wanted to do. I have no responsibilities, nothing to work towards, to no dreams, no passion for anything, just work because I had to hvac was something I chose, because it made good money, obviously, will benefit me in the future when I have to live on my own. But everything is just about money. This money that my dad wants me to be happy. But his way of seeing me happy is working. And out of this house,Tells me to pursue welding, which is understandable in his pov, because it was really tough for him growing up, had to work to survive and move to us to make sure his kids have a future. I love him for that, but it just does not work for me. I honestly do not know what makes me happy, besides my family and friends, but I believe those are external factors to my happiness. What is it that makes me happy? I do not know. I really don. I think I need a girlfriend too. Lao, I never had a relationship before. At least I do not think I did. I never make any moves. Honestly, I have been told I am attractive as, along with my personality, chef, kiss. But I have also been told I am naive as so I never notice these signs. And when I do, I really do not know what to say. I do not know how to proceed. I guess I am a mess at the moment and need a lot of fixing. I got off topic. I do not know what I am rambling about. At this point, I just felt like typing shit up on the depression sub reddit because I believe that is how I have been feeling for quite some time. If you read up to this point. Thanks for reading and sorry, if I did not make sense, and you just read some bullshit hope. Everyone who is struggling with depression pulls through it.And gets what they deserve. We all do all have a good one.

I always have packs of rice noodles. They just need to add boiling water. And whenever I buy stir fry vegetable bags, I put them in the freezer also love some banana peanut butter toast when I am craving sweet but keep the bananas in the fridge. So they last longer as they mentioned, canned soups and the refried beans from old el paso are great. I tend to add one of those microwaveable rice pouches, too. I also keep sliced bread in the freezer and just put it in the toaster if you are into smoothies, you can also get frozen fruit at my worst, I pretty much only did delivery groceries and would stock up on frozen veggies and rice noodles. So I did not have anything that would take more than min to make and sorry, I just realised this is a very long answer

Not the most cost effective way to eat but meal replacement shakes cut the time and effort for food prep. Personally, I have only tried fuel some people like the taste but it was only ok for me I certainly would drink it for enjoyment. It does contain pretty much everything you need to live nutrients and vitamin wise if you are going to go for fuel, I would recommend banana flavour, which is generally well received by people who have tried it. Hope this helps.

Meal preparation and avoid carbs, protein and vegetables. You do not even need to cut. Just buy the frozen bags and crockpot it with ready made spices or natural premises. I do that when I have stressful weeks and longer weekdays make meat sauce in a big batch and freeze it in several zip lock bags. All you got to do is boil pasta and mix or even just bread hearty, healthy and convenient.

My main one is rice, eggs, tuna and spinach with soy sauce. I buy those microwave rice sachets when I caf coking rice after its heated up. I mix spinach leave through it, dump a can of tuna into it, drizzle soy sauce and sometimes throw a fried egg on top. I can usually manage an egg, but not always also bananas, grapes, dried fruit or sultanas nuts. I ve heard cashews are excellent for mental health. Don quote meconfusion cooked chicken shredded itand kept in the fridge is a good thing to have on hand. I love cold chicken with cubes of cheese in a bowl or mayo and chicken on a sandwich.

Fruits. They are sweet and healthy, better than having candies and chocolate or coke. Another quick meal is eggs, boil them for six minutes, then chill them in cold water makes the yolk nice. And gooeyconfusion have some nuts, too. Almonds, walnuts cashew. Some seeds are good as well like flax seeds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, chia seeds. I also enjoy just drinking soy milk. I do not like count milk, but that could be refreshing for other people. Also, if you want to spend some quality minutes of your time to make some legumes or beans very low maintenance. If you wash and wet them in water the night before and stick them in the pot for thirty minutes with salt and some cumin powder or any curry powder, food is what giveth me joy. If I did not enjoy food, I would not be able to live any longer than I have

I also eat like shit. I started ordering boxes of soylent and I will drink of those every day theyare meal replacement shakes, but they actually taste pretty decent and has all the different vitamins you need to be getting not too expensive and a lot better than the replacement shakes at the grocery store they have a couple competitors like fuel you might look into but I have not tried them. They also have single serving steamed vegetables at the grocery store that you just put in the microwave. Those are pretty nice I think green giant is the only brand that makes them also crock pots are fucking great if you want to cook something and not really have to worry about it. I buy a pork butt, put it fat side down into the pot, throw a bunch of seasonings on top, then just leave it on high for hours, tastes delicious and easy. Af also great for chili and other stuff. I fucking hate cooking on a stove. I do not have the motivation for that at all. So nice to just put stuff in the crock pot and set a timer. Its like using a microwave that just takes a really long time. The pork specifically makes some damn delicious biq sandwiches I also buy, like family size lasagnas and other stuff got to bake it the first time. Then I have leftovers for, like, days that can just throw in the microwave better, yet they come in those tin trays.So I do not need to wash any containers. I also have a pill organizer that I fill up once a week with my antidepressant, multivitamin, complex fish oil, bone joint health supplement and a probiotic. Its a fucking mouthful of pills, but I just dump them all down my throat when I wake up every morning, I have not really seen much improvement, if any. With my depression, and I am still tired. But I do have a bit more energy, at least, which is cool now that im not sleeping quite as much. I have more time to think about killing myself face with tears of joy,

Hey, there. I wanted to say that I am really proud of you for giving life all that you can each day. I have anxiety and adhd, my best friend, having all of your similar conditions. Youre not alone, and I am very sorry that you have not been able to tell anyone about this. I do not know you, but I am here to support you. Any time you just need to be heard, you can respond, and I will answer. It can be very taxing to deal with everything you are faced with, and I will not give you the itll get better. Just think positive talk. I know how much you probably heard that and it has not offered you much relief. However, your feelings in any situation are valid. Youre very sweet to think of your loved ones. Lets just say the best thing you can do for yourself is tell the truth to everyone. Remember this is for you, not them. And if you can seek out some support groups, are you seeking help from a therapist? May I ask

Title: Feeling suicidal and lonely.
Thread
I am a year old female and a loser with no friends or social life. I have had friends in the past, but I either pushed those away after realizing how much worse they made me feel or they ended up leaving me for making small mistakes. Everywhere I go, I get ignored or made fun of because I am different. No matter how hard I try to be normal and likeable boys only use me for sex. I am good enough to sleep with but not good enough to date. My father is mentally and verbally abusive, controlling and makes me feel even worse for being different. It hurts so much living this way everyday. I hope that life gets better, but it just gets worse. Everything and everyone I love gets taken away from me. I have been thinking about suicide a lot recently, but I cannot do it because I do not want to hurt my mother. It is like I am forced to be stuck in this terrible life of mine. I really need some help. I have talked to multiple therapists, but none have space for another patient, or they just do not think they would be able to help me. I just want to feel like I am worth something. And like I am good enough, even if I am not like other people, my age

Title: I am actually happy after really long time.
Thread
Hello, everyone. I am a year old, and I ve been fighting with depression since my early teenage years. Its been a nightmare for most times, and I was rock bottom in the most of my life. However, today, out of nowhere, I started to feel really happy, and I cant stop smiling. I know it will not be like that forever. But im okay with it. I have lot of stress on me about job, college and social life, but somehow I just stopped getting negativity with thinking about them. And it happened all of a sudden, should I be worried about it? Is it just a phase in depression? Because I had these before, like I became really happy and functioning for months and hit rock bottom again. But this time, its not like that, because on top of happiness, I also have awareness. I realized that its too easy to just be happy. Instead of being sad, I realized being depressed, sad, suicidal and cutting myself is just my comfort and an escapism that destroys me. Its so easy to just be happy. My brain, my neurons and my feelings are there to serve me. Why did I use them to ruin my life? I just started to question it. Did anyone else experienced this before I wanted to share it? Because I think its a huge improvement in my life.

First thing I want to lead off with is that this is complete new to me and I want to be there for my dad. He recently came back from a trip back home bangladeshconfusion and is severely depressed and refuses to explain his feelings. However, he is openly willing to see someone about it. He has always been someone who has been open to therapy and mental health. Even though we come from a culture that still represses it, largely can I take him to the emergency room? I do not think he is a threat to himself or others, but I am not an expert on this. Will they even see him if he is not in immediate danger? Do I exaggerate his mental health issues to make it more urgent in their eyes? Thank you in advance for any and all help.

Stay there with him. Try and distract him from his mind. If you can suggest watching a movie going for a walk or playing a card game or something together, really is the key word here. Call your doctors office and ask them what to do in the meantime.

You might not experience any side effects or they can be very manageable and usually completely go away after a while if you really do not want to take them, dont but I would say give them a fair chance they might help a lot. You can always go off them if you are not happy with the result.

I recommend using a crisis hotline. Get a phone number, write it down on paper and tape it to your wall or someplace or put it in your phone contacts somewhere. You will see it so that when you need want to talk for minutes to vent, you can you need to start talking to people a lot earlier?

Nothing I do is ever good enough. Everyone is better than me at everything. I am stupid, shallow, ugly, poor and useless. The entire world does not want me to exist. I cannot get a job despite years and years and years of trying. I have sent my applications everywhere you name it, I have been rejected multiple times. I have used multiple dating websites and apps, spending years trying and waiting. I have never gotten a match or so much as a message from anybody. Nobody is interested in me. I live in my parents basement pursuing a useless degree in a useless major, because what company wants to hire a miserable, untalented loser there. Thousands of amateur artists way better than me. I am not good enough to be a successful artist. My skills are complete shit, my body is so broken. Not even the army wants me. I am never going to be a proper, beautiful women. I am a malnourished girl, stuck in a boring, unattractive man body. I have no friends to go to for help. Nobody is waiting for me. Nobody wants to save me. I am a lost cause the world does not care about. I am never going to succeed at anything my hobbies are pointless. Nothing I care about is going to help me. I am not good enough at anything to make it into a career. Why do I even bother? Nobody wants to play with me anyways? It pointless to try and have any kindOf fun, because there is nobody to share it with. I am trapped. I am completely trapped and alone. I am never going to go anywhere in life there no point in killing myself either. Death is permanent darkness and emptiness. There is no god or religion, and there is no afterlife. It is all fake. I do not want to die, but the world is not giving me any other options. I have nobody to fight for nothing to look forward to. The only thing I have in my future is the day I am evicted from my parent basement. I have until to escape, and then it is over. I will be out on the streets with nothing no job, no family, no home, just a hopeless loser. I am a lost cause. I should not even be complaining, because what good will complaining on reddit do me? Nobody is going to hear my plight. Nobody is ever going to read this because nobody cares. Watch this stupid nonsense get deleted from reddit it all pointless, hopeless and useless. I am a useless, unwanted. Nobody every day is a losing battle. It never going to end it never going away. It just going to be another miserable thing that will hurt me. Bad things always happen to me. It is only a matter of time before the next bad thing happens every day, swallowing a bullet becomes a more and more inviting option. Every day, I feel like taking a jack knife and carvingUp my own body. I need to destroy something, but the only thing worthless enough to destroy is myself. I do not want to die. I do not want to say goodbye. I do not want to be alone anymore. Please help me, somebody, please help me. I do not want death to be my only choice anymore. Please help me.

Yeah, a shitty life just makes most people depressed. It just takes alot of work and being uncomfortable to change for the better.

Is it easier to lie in bed and not do shit? Sure is, will it help your situation at all? Fuck no, you need to hit the gym exhaust, your body, cut out the bad habits and learn new skills.

Title: Catastrophe or fine.

So when I was a young kid, my parents had put me on medications for adhd, which included adderall, eventually became addicted to it, to the point where, if I did not have it, I would quote, lose control. I had a heart rate consistently over, and I would frequently be in the hospital not only for that, but because I have asthma as well. And my parents happened to be heavy chainsmokers who smoked in the house. I would use my nebulizer to times a day, the fifth time I had to use it at the hospital. I had a nebulizer for school. I had a nebulizer for homeconfusion. It was so bad when I lost control of myself to the point where I had police called on me as early as the age of, I would throw desks and chairs at people. At one point I broke a teacher nose, I mean, before they transferred me to another school, I had the cops called on me at least three times in second grade, but it was not just the adderall. See, the adderall had a side effect where I did not eat, and so they put me on a pill for that. Well, that eating caused me to be depressed. So they put me on a pill for that, and I kept going and going until the point I was up to seven pills in the morning, and seven pills at night. I had been so used to taking pills at this point, iCould take all seven at once without any water. I do not have a lot of memories of my childhood at least nothing specific, but when I smoke, sometimes it comes out and I remember things and makes me want to cry. My father always glorified violence, to the point where you would laugh and gloat when he talked about stories of them beating people up. My parents had taught me about sex at a very early age, to the point where I do not remember when I did not know what sex was. I remember watching american pie extremely early in my life, sometime around this time as well. I was molested. I presume it was more than once as the only time I really remember. It is when this year old kid give me a butt massage again. I could not have been more than second grade, but he was a friend of mine and my brothers for a while. I think he lived across the street with his grandparents who ran a daycare. Luckily, he was caught. I do not remember when I know I am still living in the same town, so it would not have been no more than third grade. At which point I had to give statements to police, and I remember them coming to my school to talk to me. I remember being asked if I knew what sex was, and I was a little kid, so I was embarrassed, but I knew what it was, and iRemember having to whisper in this police officer detectives ear I frequently had during this time period, episodic rages, where I would lose control of myself, as stated earlier, and I would just beat everybody up well in second grade, for sure. Second grade my mom took me to this psychiatrist that I had been seeing for a year that I only remember seeing once. In fact, I recently learned out it was a year, and it shocked me. But the only session I remember of this person was when he told me and my mom that if I developed a rash, I would die in a hour if I did not immediately get to the hospital at that point. It was her final straw, and she made the call to pull me off the drugs. And quite frankly, it saved my life. I think my dad, around this time as well, once hit me so hard that I felt spun in the air before I hit the ground is not at all a small guy. He used to boast all the time, how he could bench labs, as well as how he was a trained boxer and a third degree black belt in taekwondo. My father is a narcissist. Textbook definition. So I have no reason to believe him, but I will never forget how hard he hit me that day, because I said I was not excited to see my grandma, which happened to be his mom. Sorry for the rant. My girlfriend alwaysCries when I talk about my past but I do not think it was so bad we were poor enough that I did not always get to eat there much more to my store than this is just mostly how it was in the early years.

Life is too hard. Maybe I should get medical help, but that costs money. I do not have money. I can barely muster the energy to do enough at my job to very hopefully not get myself fired and starve. I am just too tired to fight, too tired to do whatever it is I have to do to help myself. I am just fucked. I just do not want to navigate these damn systems. I am tired of working. I am tired of doing. I just do not care, man it not my choice not to care either. My mind just runs a mile a fucking minute. Why the fuck do I care about doing this? Why the fuck do I care about doing that? The only time I care about anything is when I am high. I cannot even be bothered with going to the goddamn post office to get my address changed from the place I moved out of three months ago. Amp I have no dreams or passions, I have no vision. I just wish it was easier to die. It hurts to type that, because when I think of death, I think of relief and to tell myself, I do not get to die yet, that I have to suffer through this pathetic life with the onus on me, to do everything. When I just do not want to do anything, in the literal sense, it makes me feel like a kid who just got told he does not get toHave a cookie. I do not know. I cannot handle life. My brain is deteriorated and there is nothing here for me.

Title: Never had a job at hopeless situation. Is there any option left?
Thread
Hello, I am in a terrible situation I have never had a job at. I cannot work until I am, at least because I am going through heavy medical treatment for at least a year from now. I have been struggling with a disability ever since I am, and it prevented me from doing anything in life. I have dropped out of college after being successful for the first years despite my condition. But after that, my condition became too bad and I failed years upon years until I dropped out. I wished to become an engineer. So now I have spent the last years of my life doing nothing but struggling with a condition. I am sick on chronic phases, months a year roughly. I now have some hope of getting better, but that will not be before more year, at least on top of my physical condition. I now struggle with severe depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, two suicide attempts in the last year. I now someone at who never had work experience is unemployable nowadays, I have nothing good going for me, no skills. I would like to have a decent job in the future, but that seems impossible. I would be fine with low wage jobs to start with, but even applications to those are always getting rejected. And it is worse because a big issue is that I probably will stay too disabled to do physically hard work. I would need to go paper desk jobs because my physical condition will notBe able to sustain heavy physical job. I would look for a restaurant jobs doing the dishes or so but that does not seem possible with my disability as it is still physically exhausting I know saying that looks like lazy but when your body joints are very shit it is a bit complicated I was thinking about learning programming in the year of medical treatment I have coming since I am going slightly better now but that looks like it is too late. I have heard it was impossible to land a first job in computer science without experience in any work when you are, which would be the best case scenario for me. All college in my country are rejecting me because of my failures but I really could not succeed because of the condition I have for months a year. I could barely get out of my bed and was on opiates and such. I am coming ever closer to killing myself. So that is a last cry for help. I know self pity is shit and looked down upon, but I hardly can do anything else.

I know many companies are looking only for degrees but if you learned programming and are having passion and maybe made a project by your own, which you can use as reference, then you can find a job are any online colleges in your country and do they also do not accept you for studying

Title: Am I depressed?
Thread
Hey, so I know that this is not the right place to seek diagnosis, but I cant get medical therapy help for the moment, so I would really appreciate a help from those who has delt or still dealing with depression. So ive got those symptoms for over years. I guess it started with in my college first year, and I ruled it as beeing, overwhelmed and stressed. But since I am still dealing with it now, I think it something else. Its hard to explain it exactly, but it comes and goes, its always in the back of my head the thought that my life is not worth it, that there is no point of living that I am not good enough, but when it overwhelms, I tend to sleep a lot, eat less and literally dont do anything. The thing is, when you ask people about me, even my family, whom I share a house with, will tell you that I am an optimist, funny and a happy person I have never showed them that side of me. It feels that those thoughts are shallow and of a teen. Its like I have nothing to be sad about. So why be dramatic? And when the wave washes over, I feel guilty for wasting my time since I should be studying. But instead I wasted it on silly stuff I no longer do the thing I love as often I used to draw and read daily. Now I feel like I force myself to doIt when I try and I dont get that joy that I used to form it I tried to look for knew hobbies, thinking that I just overgrew them. But nothing interest me. I feel like my life is this typical cyearcle that everybody lives in, and I can see what it will be like in the future, and its not worth it. I dont know if its relevant, but I cry so easily. Sometimes im just sitting alone doing nothing, and this urge to cry overwhelms me and I have a good cry. Its weird because it happens suddenly and with nothing to cause it. But I also cry at the slightest argument, like, just right now I was talking with my brother and having an argument. Just when it git bit serious, I felt my eyes tear ip and my voice crack and us not the first time when I confront people when I tell my opinion to someone who might not agree, and I start defending mine every normal convo that is not happy and jokey. I tear up, and its so frustrating to be like this, to seem weak to others, but I genuinely cant help it, and its really messing me up. I am afraid to have serious convoy or debates because of it. Is it relevant to depression at all? At the end, because the waves come and go, I think to myself that its just stress or sadness and not depression. I have never met someone with depression. SoI dont really know if it should show that they deal with depression, so I would really like your help. How to get over those feelings. Is this depression or me being gloomy?

Yea. It sounds like you do actually have symptoms of depression and you cannot really help it when the wave comes so there is nothing silly about it or to feel selfish or guilty about you cannot help it. So why beat yourself up more over it? Plus you should really go talk to someone when you have the chance and not to minimize how you feel or your experience but at least it sounds like it is mild ishconfusion. It could be worse but seriously see someone before it does.

Title: How to help someone who self harms
Thread
If you do not want to read it all, please just offer advice regarding the title. I have a friend we call her, is a friend of mine who lives far away. She takes meds and sees a psychiatrist, has a horribly abusive home life. Few to no. In real life friends, no other siblings or other family, and school does not appear to be a safe place either. She recently relapsed on self harm reason yet unknown at school in the bathroom. After I thinkconfusion, a couple months of not doing it, and I mutually agreed not to kill ourselves while the other is around. And she said, she will not harm herself when I asked her not to a couple months agoconfusion. But she went back to school at the start of the week after a long absence, and on thursday, she could not hold it in. I do not know how bad it is yet, but in own words, from two months ago, once I start cutting, I cannot stop, and it scares me I have no experience with so or handling it. What am I to do? How can I help her? I am, of course, doing everything I already know to with depression. I am always open and available for her. I give her space when she is not feeling well. Sometimes daysconfusion, I always check in share pictures, occasional updates, cute stuff. I make sure to keep my own problems, depressive topics to myself. I try to give and remindHer things to look forward to live life for. I respect her space and do not push or pry deeper than she is willing to tell me. I let her know I would do anything to help her if she would ask, reassure her that she is never and could never be a bother to me, that I want her problems to be my problems too, and that we get through things together. I tell her how proud I am that she is trying so hard not to. So that to me, she is perfect the way she is, even if she or others do not think so. And I frequently let her know how important she is and that she is loved and cared for, and that someday she finally be free from her current torment. But I do not know what to do. Beyond that, I would never say something I do not fully truly mean. I do not spout baseless optimism, and I do everything I can to reassure her that we get through things together. And someday, these bad days will be behind her. If there is anything else I can do to help, or if I am maybe handling something wrong, please help me help her

Title: I will commit suicide in future.
Thread
I believe it on. I am getting help. I am not alone in this. I reached out, but I will kill myself. After all, hope is gone, and it will. I know it because it are not feelings that tell me to do it, but logical reasoning. I do not believe I can be happy and live meaningful life in world I live in. There is no way out. Its empty life do not get better when you are poor, its meaningless struggle. Sure, having kids would be a easy reason to stay, but I dont want to bring them into world where they spend life in meaningless shit just to fulfill life of the rich and then they have to make kids so they dont kill themselves.
