Lorazepam was my go to medication. It sure helped, but I was never easy taking it because of its addictive potential. Then I found out about cod and gave it a try. It took me some time to figure out how to dose it now it is all I ever take, and it helps me a great deal. I do not know details about your condition, so this suggestion might be way off.

Thread\\nHey guys, I am a year old, man. In my final year in university, you could say I had a pretty sheltered upbringing and really have not been taking life seriously till now. I realized this is a coping mechanism, because I do not like facing reality or taking charge of my life. I am scared to live. Adulthood just seems to be filled with horrors with very little hope. Even the tiniest mistake can wreck your life. So many things are decided from your birth itself. What family you are born into, the class, you belong to the race you belong to and your genetics. All of these have a massive impact on your life. Making mistakes in adulthood is permanent. You mess up bad, and it will follow you all your life without money, power or influence. I do not know how an average person lives. How do you not live in constant fear? It just seems like in today, society, we are at the mercy of other people, the system and the government, society, personally, does not care about you much at all. Cross the wrong person. You can get killed, get into legal trouble. You can spend most of your life in jail and have your life ruined.

I realized this is a coping mechanism, because I do not like facing reality or taking charge of my life. I am scared to live. Adulthood just seems to be filled with horrors with very little hope. Even the tiniest mistake can wreck your life. So many things are decided from your birth itself. What family you are born into, the class, you belong to the race you belong to and your genetics.

And the next moment, there is nothing that idea is the most disturbing one in our lives. Ironicallyconfusion, you only have one try.

Thread\\nI have talked to a few religious people about this, but their explanations have never really made me feel comfortable with the afterlife.', 'Thread\\nIntroduction for the people who do not know about the topic at handkiss, free will is the believe that beings, especially human beingsconfusion, can choose the actions that they want to do. So they have the capacity to decide the outcome that they do. They can do one thing or the other, and after making a decision they could have done otherwise. Most non philosopher people probably believe that we have free will. I assume this since statistics indicate that most people in the world are religious, and probably most religions are based on the believe of free willconfusion. Determinism is the believe that all actions that people do are determined by previous causes, so people cannot choose the outcome that they do, but they still have the illusion of free will. This means that when someone makes a decision, they could not have done otherwise. The people are like some kind of machines that receive inputs, information from the outsideconfusion process, it in their brains bodies, and they give an output. In this case, the output would be an actionconfusion that oversimplifying things a lot. Compatibilism is the believe that free will and determinism are compatible. Both of them can exist at the same time.

Self-expression is the ability to express yourself in a way that makes you feel good about yourself. For example, if you want to feel better about yourself, you can look at yourself in the mirror and say, \"I'm a good person, and I'm not a bad person.\" This is self-expression. If you don't feel like you're doing a good job of expressing yourself, then you can go to a therapist and ask for help.\n","6237                                                             What is Self-Esteem?                                                 Self-Esteem is a measure of how you feel about yourself. It can be measured in a number of ways, but the most important one is how confident you are in yourself. If you are confident in yourself, you are more likely to do things that make you feel good about yourself, and you are less likely to feel bad about yourself if you don't do those things.\n","6238                                                      What is Self-Actualization?                                                                 Self-Actualization is the belief that you are capable of doing anything you put your mind to. For example, if I tell you that you can do anything you want, and you do it, you will feel good about yourself. However, if you tell me that I can't do anything, and I do it anyway, I will feel bad about myself.
