R. Martin's ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' epic fantasy novel series.  She is a prominent point of view character in the novels with the third most viewpoint chapters, and is the only viewpoint character to have appeared in every published book of the series.\\nIntroduced in 1996's ''A Game of Thrones'', Arya is the third child and younger daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark.  She is tomboyish, headstrong, feisty, independent, disdains traditional female pursuits, and is often mistaken for a boy.  She wields a smallsword named Needle, a gift from her half-brother, Jon Snow, and is trained in the Braavosi style of sword fighting by Syrio Forel.\\nArya is portrayed by English actress Maisie Williams in HBO's Emmy-winning television adaptation of the novel series, ''Game of Thrones''.  Her performance has garnered critical acclaim, particularly in the second season for her work opposite veteran actor Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) when she served as his cupbearer. She is among the most popular characters in either version of the story.  Williams was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the role in 2016. She and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\", '\\n=== Recognition and awards ===\\nMaisie Williams has received several award nominations for her portrayal of Arya. For her performance in the series she received two Portal Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Young Actor in 2012, an EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2014, and a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Television Series in 2015.\\nWilliams was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016. Other nominations include the Portal Award for Best Young Actor in 2011, the SFX Awards for Best Actress in 2012 and 2015, the Gold Derby TV Awards for Breakthrough Performer of the Year in 2012, the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series by a Supporting Young Actress in 2013, the EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2015, and the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Television Series in 2016.', \"\\n=== Television series ===\\nArya Stark is portrayed by English actress Maisie Williams in the television adaption of the book series, this being Williams' first role as an actress. Williams was chosen from among 300 actresses across England.\\nMaisie Williams plays the role of Arya Stark in the television series.\", '\\n=== Description ===\\nArya is left-handed and talented in sums and housekeeping, and is excellent at horse-riding.  In contrast to her more praised sister Sansa, who favors activities traditionally befitting a noblewoman and expresses disdain for outdoor activities, Arya shows no interest in dancing, singing and sewing, and revels in fighting and exploring, much to the chagrin of her mother and household tutor Septa Mordane.  She is described as \"wolf-blooded\", blunt, impulsive and \"always difficult to tame\" by her mother, and was given the nickname \"Arya Underfoot\" by the guards of Winterfell.  She is particularly close to her bastard half-brother Jon Snow, who encourages her to learn how to fight and gives her the smallsword Needle.  The sword is well suited to Arya\\'s slender build and her favored \"Water Dance\" (fencing) style  which emphasizes speed and agility with a thin, light rapier used in quick thrusting attacks.  Throughout her travels, Arya displays great resourcefulness and cunning and also becomes increasingly ruthless.\\nArya is the only one out of her full-siblings to inherit the Stark features and is said to resemble her late aunt Lyanna in both looks and temperament.  At the start of the series, she is generally regarded as messy and plain-looking, and often mistaken for a boy; but there are multiple instances in the books of her (favorable) comparison to the beautiful Lyanna, and catching the eye of men later on in the series.  She is also a skinchanger, capable of telepathically possessing her direwolf Nymeria in dreams, as well as psychically bonding with a street tomcat in Braavos.', '\\n===Television series===\\nIn January 2007 HBO secured the rights to adapt Martin\\'s series for television. Jennifer Ehle was originally cast as Catelyn Stark and filmed her scenes in the unaired pilot until she eventually left for family reasons. Michelle Fairley was then cast in the role, which she played for three seasons. Catelyn\\'s storyline diverges from the book following the Red Wedding in that she never reappears as Lady Stoneheart.\\nFairley\\'s performance has received critical acclaim. \\'\\'Time\\'\\' wrote about \"The Rains of Castamere\": \"Michelle Fairley’s fantastic performance captures the horror, with the edge of desperation, anguish, and madness of a woman who has lost her sons (she believes all of them), lost her grandchild, may have lost her daughters, and for all she knows, is witnessing the extinction of the house she belongs to...\". The closing scene of \"Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things\" was praised by HitFix\\'s Alan Sepinwall, highlighting Michelle Fairley\\'s acting as Catelyn gathers allies to arrest Tyrion.', '\\n===Casting and development===\\nA blue, scale-covered dress worn by Daenerys in the TV series \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\\nMartin said that the character was aged in the television series because of child pornography regulations. Tamzin Merchant played Daenerys in the original pilot, but the first episode was re-shot with Emilia Clarke in the role. Weiss and Benioff said, \"Emilia was the only person we saw—and we saw hundreds—who could carry the full range that Daenerys required\". Clarke, in reflection of the character\\'s evolution in the television series, stated: \"Throughout the season she\\'s had an insane transformation from someone who barely even spoke and timidly did everything her brother said into a mother of dragons and a queen of armies and a killer of slave masters. She\\'s a very Joan of Arc-style character.\" Clarke said she accepts acting nude if \"a nude scene forwards a story or is shot in a way that adds insight into characters\". She added that \"sometimes explicit scenes are required and make sense for the characters/story, as they do in Westeros\" and that she can discuss with a director how to make a gratuitously nude scene more subtle. Clarke, however, has used a body double in past background non-nude appearances, particularly Rosie Mac in season 5.\\nIn October 2014, Clarke and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' called the raises \"huge\", noting that the deal would make the performers \"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\". \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' put the number for season five at \"close to $300,000 an episode\" for each actor, and \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \"upward of $500,000 per episode\" for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Clarke became one of the highest paid actors on television and earned £2\\xa0million per episode for the show.', \"\\n=== Arya Stark ===\\nArya Stark is the third child and younger daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. She serves as a POV character for 33 chapters throughout ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', ''A Storm of Swords'', ''A Feast for Crows'', and ''A Dance with Dragons''. So far she is the only character to appear in all 5 books as a POV character.\\nIn the HBO television adaptation, she is portrayed by Maisie Williams.\", '\\n===Reception===\\nSophie Turner plays the role of Sansa Stark in the television series\\nAs her storyline has progressed, Sansa has received critical acclaim for the development of her character and her emergence from a naive young girl to a strong young woman. \\'\\'Rolling Stone\\'\\' ranked Sansa as No. 4 on a list of the \"Top 40 \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' Characters\", saying that Sansa is \"often overlooked in favor of her killer kid sister\", but that her \"quiet, innate political shrewedness and emotional strength have enabled her to survive\", and calling her \"the show\\'s best-kept secret\". In a ranking of the 48 best \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' characters listed in the main credits in the first five seasons on the website \\'\\'The Wrap\\'\\', Sansa was ranked at No. 4, ahead of the more popular Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, and Tyrion Lannister, saying that \"Sansa has been kind of great in Season 6, turning into the sort of badass we always hoped but never thought she actually could become\".\\nIn an article published on \\'\\'Mic.\\'\\'com, Julianne Ross says that \"the elder Stark daughter is often cited as one of the most reviled characters on \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\", while also saying that \"not coincidentally, Sansa Stark is also one of the most classically feminine characters on the show.\" Ross criticized the heavy hatred for Sansa, particularly in contrast to \"her universally (and rightly) adored tomboy little sister Arya\", stating that Sansa \"arguably gets a disproportionate amount of fan hate because she doesn\\'t fit the narrow \\'strong female character\\' mold we\\'re used to rooting for.\"  Blogger Rhiannon Thomas of \\'\\'Feminist Fiction\\'\\' wrote in 2012 that \"the focus on this sort of female character - the oft-cited \\'strong female character\\' - seems to suggest that femininity is still \\'\\'bad,\\'\\' and that women can only be strong by adopting stereotypically male roles and attitudes\". Thomas went on to say that \"in an abusive situation that would break so many people, Sansa survives\" and that she has a \"woman\\'s courage\" that \"keeps her alive and in the game where characters like Arya would not last five minutes\".\\nIn an article published on MTV.com by Crystal Bell titled \"Sansa Stark is the Only \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' Hero Worth Rooting For\", Bell writes: \"Sansa is the most relatable character in George R.R. Martin\\'s canon. She\\'s often despised for having no agency, but the way I see it, Sansa is hated for being a woman. Unlike Brienne, Arya, Cersei, and Margaery -- models of the \"strong female character\" archetype—Sansa\\'s passivity denotes weakness. She doesn\\'t have cool swordplay skills like her sister Arya; she isn\\'t a smart seductress like Margaery Tyrell or a fierce queen like Cersei. She is the epitome of femininity on \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\', and therefore, she is dismissed.\" Bell went on to say: \"However, Sansa\\'s greatest strength as a character has been her unwavering resilience. She was tortured and humiliated for seasons by the unhinged man-boys around her. She\\'s been the subject of everyday sexism and misogyny since day one. And yet, she survives, even as armor-clad heroes fall before her. She is the show\\'s survivor. She continuously \\'\\'endures\\'\\' the pain and humiliation of being a woman in Westeros. Just because Sansa doesn\\'t wield a sword as fiercely as Arya and Brienne, or command a horde of dragons like Daenerys Targaryen, doesn\\'t make her any less of a hero.\"\\nSansa received particular acclaim in Season 6 of the show, during which she began her quest to retake her family home and exact revenge on those who wronged her. In an interview with \\'\\'The New York Times\\'\\', actress Sophie Turner said that \"she\\'s Sansa no longer a pawn in anyone\\'s game; she\\'s no longer a prisoner...she\\'s the one taking charge and doing her own thing, which is very exciting\". Megan Garber of \\'\\'The Atlantic\\'\\' praised the show\\'s decision to have Sansa be the one orchestrating Ramsay\\'s death in Battle of the Bastards, saying that \"In the end, it was Sansa and her abuser, alone again in a darkened chamber; in the end though, it was Sansa making the decisions about who would be the victim.\"  On the scene, Turner said: \"It\\'s amazing. It\\'s Sansa\\'s first kill and it\\'s such a strong moment for her because all her life she\\'s been affected by these men who have just done such terrible things to her....\"\\nFollowing the penultimate Season 6 episode, Bennett Madison of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' wrote \"When Sansa icily reminds her dopey brother that \\'No one can protect you\\', it\\'s because she\\'s always been on her own. As far back as King\\'s Landing, Sansa\\'s between quietly protecting herself, working on her stitchery while taking cool measure of everything going on around her, learning how to game the system, and slithering through situations that would have gotten the best of the show\\'s more flashy or impulsive characters. In \\'Battle of the Bastards\\', she got to show a little flash of her own; by being defiantly, gloriously correct in her convictions, by saving the day with her foresight and savvy, and by feeding Ramsay to the dogs.\"  Turner later told \\'\\'Time\\'\\' magazine about how gratifying it was to watch Sansa\\'s development during Season 6 and defended the show on its cruel treatment of women: \"In my opinion, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' is not sexist, and it\\'s accurate to medieval time. The show puts social boundaries on the women, and they break out of these boundaries.\"', '\\n==Character description==\\nCatelyn Stark is described as beautiful, with fair skin, long auburn hair, blue eyes, long fingers, high cheekbones and full breasts, and dressed simply in the grey color of House Stark or the blue and red of her father’s House Tully.  She is proud, strong, kind and generous, has a strong grasp of politics, and is often governed by the desire to protect her children.  Catelyn is usually in accord with her husband Eddard Stark, but resents his admission of his illegitimate son Jon Snow into their household.', \"\\n===Brienne of Tarth===\\n'''Brienne of Tarth''' (seasons 2–8) portrayed by Gwendoline Christie. A former member of Renly Baratheon's Kingsguard. She is a highly trained and skilled warrior made dangerous by the fact that men underestimate her. She is considered ugly because she is abnormally large in height and build, androgynous, and stronger than most men. She wishes to prove her valor in a worthy cause to win respect and acceptance. She becomes infatuated with Renly after he shows her kindness and courtesy, and she wins a place in his Kingsguard after winning a tournament melee against Ser Loras. Renly trusts Brienne because of her loyalty and her willingness to die for him. She is present at Renly's death and is falsely accused of his murder.\", \"\\n==Storylines ==\\nCoat of arms of House Baratheon\\nGendry is not a point of view character in the novels, and his actions are witnessed and interpreted primarily through the eyes of Arya Stark, as well as some descriptions from Eddard Stark and Brienne of Tarth.  He has the most story arc out of King Robert's children.\", '\\n===Recognition and awards===\\nPeter Dinklage is the series\\'s most successful cast member in terms of awards, having won 7 awards and received 37 additional nominations\\nDinklage\\'s performance was praised; \\'\\'The Boston Globe\\'\\' called his Tyrion one of the show\\'s \"highlights\", adding that Dinklage \"gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware.\" Matt Roush of \\'\\'TV Guide\\'\\' told viewers to \"rejoice in the scene-stealing bravado of Peter Dinklage as the wry \\'imp\\' Tyrion Lannister.\" The \\'\\'Los Angeles Times\\'\\' wrote \"In many ways, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' belongs to Dinklage\" even before, in Season 2, the \"scene-stealing actor\\'s\" character became the series\\' most central figure. \\'\\'The New York Times\\'\\' noted that as beloved as the character of Tyrion is to the novels\\' fans, \"Dinklage\\'s sly performance has made Tyrion all the more popular.\" \\'\\'The Huffington Post\\'\\' called Tyrion the \"most quotable\" character on the HBO series, as well as one of the most beloved.\\nIn April 2011 both the \\'\\'Los Angeles Times\\'\\' and \\'\\'Entertainment Weekly\\'\\' pronounced Dinklage worthy of an Emmy Award for his performance in Season 1. He subsequently received one for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. He also earned a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a Scream Award for Best Supporting Actor for Season 1 of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'. Dinklage won the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor again in 2015, and 2018.\\nDinklage has been nominated for the Emmy four other times for playing Tyrion, in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016. He has received several other award nominations for his performance in the series, including the Critics\\' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2012 and 2016; the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2012, 2015, and 2016; the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017; the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama in 2011 and 2012; and in 2011 both the IGN Award and the IGN People\\'s Choice Award for Best TV Actor.', '\\n===Recognition and awards===\\nSophie Turner has received several award nominations for her portrayal of Sansa including an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2019. For her performance in the series she earned the Glamour Award for Best UK TV Actress in 2016 and 2017, and an EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016. Other nominations include the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series by a Supporting Young Actress in 2012, and the EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2015.', \"\\n==== Season 2 ====\\nStannis' personal banner in the TV series.\\nStannis falls under the influence of Melisandre, a priestess of R'hllor who believes Stannis is the reincarnation of a legendary hero from her religion. After Robert's death, Stannis claims himself the true heir to the Iron Throne as Cersei's children are bastards born of incest. However, most of the Baratheon bannermen support the claim of the younger but far more charismatic Renly. Stannis confronts Renly and offers to make him his heir if he supports him, but Renly refuses, only using the negotiations as an opportunity to mock his brother, and intending to kill Stannis in battle the next day. Melisandre, who had seduced Stannis, gives birth to a shadow baby bearing Stannis' face that kills Renly, and many of Renly's bannermen immediately swear allegiance to Stannis. He then attacks King's Landing by sailing up Blackwater Bay. Stannis' force breaches the walls, but due to Tyrion Lannister's use of wildfire and the arrival of last-minute Lannister and Tyrell reinforcements, he is defeated. Nonetheless, he is convinced to continue fighting by Melisandre, and is further convinced by her magic as she shows him a vision of a battle in the flames.\", '\\n====Controversy====\\nIn the episode \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\", Sansa\\'s rape was the main subject of controversy for the season\\'s deviations from the books. The majority of professional criticism concerned the decision to have Ramsay rape Sansa on their wedding night, with most critics describing the scene as gratuitous and artistically unnecessary. \"This grim scene was difficult for the show to justify,\" said Charlotte Runcie of \\'\\'The Daily Telegraph\\'\\'. Joanna Robinson of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' added, \"this rape scene undercuts all the agency that’s been growing in Sansa since the end of last season. ... I’d never advocate that \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' (or any work of fiction) shy away from edgy plots out of fear of pushback or controversy. But edgy plots should always accomplish something above pure titillation or shock value and what, \\'\\'exactly\\'\\', was accomplished here?\" Christopher Orr wrote in \\'\\'The Atlantic\\'\\', \"I continue to be astonished that showrunners Benioff and Weiss still apparently believe that their tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, and—especially—sexual violence of George R.R. Martin’s source material is a strength rather than the defining weakness of their adaptation.\" Myles McNutt of \\'\\'The A.V. Club\\'\\' wrote, \"The issue with the show returning to rape as a trope is not simply because there have been thinkpieces speaking out against it, and is not solely driven by the rational concerns lying at the heart of those thinkpieces. It’s also that the show has lost my faith as a viewer.\" Writers from \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\', \\'\\'The Mary Sue\\'\\' and \\'\\'The Daily Beast\\'\\' all disapproved of the decision to use Sansa\\'s victimization as a motivating agent for Theon, saying that the scene undermined Sansa\\'s character development: \"Was it really important to make that scene about Theon\\'s pain?\" wrote Joanna Robinson of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\'.\\nOther critics responded positively to the scene. Sean T. Collins of \\'\\'Rolling Stone\\'\\' wrote: \"By involving a multidimensional main character instead of one introduced primarily to suffer, the series has a chance to grant this story the gravity and seriousness it deserves. Sarah Hughes of \\'\\'The Guardian\\'\\' wrote: \"I have repeatedly made clear that I’m not a fan of rape as a plot device – but the story of Ramsay and Sansa’s wedding was more than that. ... The writers are walking a very fine line here. They handled it well tonight, telling a gothic tale of innocence sacrificed\". Alyssa Rosenberg of \\'\\'The Washington Post\\'\\' wrote that the scene \"managed to maintain a fine balance, employing a dignity and care for the experiences of victims that \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' has not always demonstrated.\"\\nSome critics questioned why this scene in particular should generate outrage when similar scenes have not. Sara Stewart of the \\'\\'New York Post\\'\\' pointed out that the rape and sexual abuse of both female and male characters is typical for \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\': \"Why are we suddenly so outraged about the rape of Sansa Stark, when this show has served up a steady diet of sexual assault and violence against women since its first season began?\" Cathy Young of \\'\\'Reason\\'\\' magazine, writing in \\'\\'Time\\'\\' noted what she calls a lack of complaint in response to the sexual mistreatment of male characters in earlier seasons, specifically the literal emasculation of Theon Greyjoy and the sexual assault of Gendry.\\nCriticism of the scene has not extended to the quality of the acting. Joanna Robinson of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' wrote, \"And if we can say one positive thing about that scene it\\'s that Allen nailed his performance. Theon\\'s horror mirrored our own and the camera—focusing on his reaction—let our minds fill in the blanks.\" Sophie Turner defended the scene as an artistic challenge for herself as an actor, saying, \"When I read that scene, I kinda loved it. I love the way Ramsay had Theon watching. It was all so messed up. It\\'s also so daunting for me to do it. ... I think it\\'s going to be the most challenging season for me so far, just because it\\'s so emotional for her. It\\'s not just crying all the time, like seasons 2 or 3, it\\'s super messed up.\" Iwan Rheon (Ramsay Bolton) agreed, referring to Turner\\'s performances this season as \"absolutely amazing.\"\\nSome viewers, including U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, announced that they would stop watching the show because of this scene. According to \\'\\'Business Insider\\'\\', this scene and increased use of streaming services are likely reasons why ratings dropped from 6.2 million viewers for this episode to 5.4 million for the next episode, \"The Gift.\"', '\\n===Cersei\\'s walk of atonement===\\nActress Lena Headey portrays Cersei Lannister in the series.\\nFor Cersei Lannister\\'s nude \"walk of atonement\" through King\\'s Landing, HBO employed actress Rebecca Van Cleave as a body double for Lena Headey. While filming the scene in Dubrovnik, Croatia in October 2014, Van Cleave performed fully nude while Headey wore a simple beige shift. Both performances were then merged by the show\\'s editing team, combining close-ups of Headey\\'s facial expressions and long shots of Van Cleave\\'s nude walk through the city. In some instances CGI was used to put Headey\\'s face on Van Cleave\\'s body.\\nHeadey says that the showrunners decided to cast a body double for \"several reasons.\" Headey says she was glad to use a body double for the scene because she wanted to focus on the character\\'s emotions. Another actor noted that Headey\\'s \"extensive tattoos\" may have been another reason. Months later, Headey announced that she was pregnant with her second child, though it is unclear if she was pregnant when this scene had to be filmed. Sarah Buchanan of \\'\\'Express\\'\\' notes the strangeness of casting a much younger actress to play the middle-aged Cersei when the key outcome of the walk of atonement in \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' is that when the people see that Cersei\\'s body is not beautiful, she loses a large part of her mystique. The 27-year-old Van Cleave did not show any of the specific signs of aging or past pregnancy for which the Cersei of the books was mocked by the crowd.\\nWhen casting for the role, HBO received applications from more than  actresses to act as Headey\\'s body double for the scene. A selection of seven finalists, including Van Cleave, was then flown to Belfast, Northern Ireland to audition before the show\\'s producers. Headey also opted out of the casting process, but director David Nutter said finding the right double was one of the most important parts of making the finale. \"We needed somebody who could do The Walk of Shame physically, somebody who could match Lena\\'s integrity, intensity, and sensibility. We found a tremendous actress in Rebecca; she was a godsend. The courage of this girl, who\\'s never done anything like this in her life, who understood what was important about this...once I had her I felt like I could accomplish anything.\"\\nVan Cleave herself described the scene as \"one of the scariest, most wonderful, most gratifying experiences I could have imagined ... I never in a million years would have thought I would be in Dubrovnik surrounded by hundreds of extras and crew members throwing food at me, but it was amazing\" and \"I hope the next thing I do will have my head in it.\" She also praised Headey\\'s willingness to help her, describing the two of them as a \"tag-team\"; Headey would walk behind Van Cleave during the shoot, coaching her on the character\\'s responses.\\nWhen the showrunners first announced the plans of shooting a nude scene in Dubrovnik, the city\\'s Catholic Church of St. Nicholas strongly opposed the idea, due to it being immoral to walk their sacred grounds in the nude. Eventually, both parties came to the agreement that the shooting could commence, provided no nude scenes would be filmed in a place of worship. During the three-day shoot, Headey walked Van Cleave through each shot, giving insight into all the emotions Cersei was feeling. The six-minute scene was filmed using 500 extras.', '\\'\\'\\'Catelyn Stark\\'\\'\\' (née \\'\\'\\'Tully\\'\\'\\') is a fictional character in the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' series of fantasy novels by American author George R. R. Martin, and its television adaptation \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'.  She is a prominent point of view character in the first three novels.\\nIntroduced in 1996\\'s \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\', Catelyn is the wife of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, the Warden of the North, and is mother to five of his children, but resents his bastard son Jon Snow.  She was born into House Tully of Riverrun, the lord paramount clan of the Riverlands, another one of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and has two younger siblings, sister Lysa and brother Edmure.  Catelyn was originally betrothed to Eddard\\'s older brother Brandon Stark, the heir to Winterfell at the time, and married Eddard instead after the former\\'s death leading up to Robert Baratheon\\'s rebellion against House Targaryen.\\nCatelyn is portrayed by Northern Irish actress Michelle Fairley on the HBO series \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'.  American actress Jennifer Ehle was originally cast as Catelyn Stark and appeared in the unaired pilot, but left the series for family reasons before the first season began. Fairley\\'s portrayal of Catelyn has garnered critical acclaim, with many in particular praising her performance during the episode \"The Rains of Castamere\". Due to this popularity, many fans were disappointed she did not appear in the series\\' fourth season, despite the character\\'s resurrection in the novels.', '\\n==Character and appearances==\\nSansa Stark is the second child and elder daughter of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Stark. She was born and raised in Winterfell, until leaving with her father and sister at the beginning of the series. She was raised with a younger sister Arya Stark, two younger brothers Rickon Stark and Bran Stark, as well as an older brother Robb Stark, and an older illegitimate half-brother, Jon Snow.\\nRaised as a lady, Sansa is traditionally feminine. Sansa\\'s interests are music, poetry, and singing. She strives to become like the heroines of romantic tales by attempting to find a prince, knight, or gentleman to fall in love with. For a companion animal, she owned a direwolf named Lady. However, Lady was killed in place of Arya\\'s direwolf, Nymeria, after Nymeria attacked the Crown Prince, Joffrey Baratheon, and later fled.\\nSansa has been described as tall, slim, womanly, and beautiful, destined to be a lady or a queen. She has blue eyes and thick auburn hair that she inherits from her mother, who came from House Tully in the Riverlands region prior to her marriage to Eddard Stark. She has her hair dyed dark brown later on while in the Vale, disguised as Alayne Stone, the bastard daughter of Petyr Baelish.  Sansa is 11 years old in \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\' and nearly 14 in \\'\\'A Feast for Crows\\'\\'. Arguably the most naive of the Stark children at the start of the series, Sansa often finds herself used as a pawn in the machinations of the other characters. However, as the story progresses, she matures and becomes more of a player of the game rather than a pawn for other characters. She is the most beautiful woman in Westeros at the time of the events of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".', '\\n==TV adaptation==\\nExecutive producers/writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss had pitched the idea of adapting Martin\\'s series for television to HBO in March 2006, and the network secured the rights in January 2007. The first actor cast was Peter Dinklage as Tyrion in May 2009. Benioff and Weiss later noted that the funny and \"incredibly smart\" Dinklage was their first choice for the role, as the actor\\'s \"core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well in keeping with the character.\" Unfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, \"he wouldn\\'t play elves or leprechauns\" and – choosy about genre roles – he had just come from portraying the dwarf Trumpkin in 2008\\'s \\'\\'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\\'\\'. Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was \"a different kind of fantasy little person,\" or in the actor\\'s words, \"No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being.\" Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because \"They told me how popular he was.\" Martin said of Dinklage\\'s casting, \"If he hadn\\'t accepted the part, oh, boy, I don\\'t know what we would have done.\" Benioff added, \"When I read George\\'s books, I decided Tyrion Lannister was one of the great characters in literature. Not just fantasy literature – literature! A brilliant, caustic, horny, drunken, self-flagellating mess of a man. And there was only one choice to play him.\"\\nIn October 2014, Dinklage and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' called the raises \"huge\", noting that the deal would make the performers \"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\". \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' put the number for season five at \"close to $300,000 an episode\" for each actor, and \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \"upward of $500,000 per episode\" for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Dinklage became one of the highest paid actors on television and will earn £2\\xa0million per episode for the show.', '\\n===Appearance and personality===\\nStannis is frequently described as a large and sinewy man that towers over others, such as Davos Seaworth and Jon Snow, a Baratheon trait. He lacks the long black hair of his brothers, and is instead balding, although he keeps a close-cropped beard of the signature Baratheon black. His face is described as \\'tight like cured leather\\' with hollow, gaunt cheeks. His eyes are described by Asha Greyjoy as \\'deep, sunken pits\\', with a powerful stare that suggests an \\'iron ferocity\\'.\\nStannis\\' most prominent characteristics are his flinty and austere demeanor, unrelenting stubbornness, and powerful sense of duty and justice, the latter of which he is notorious for throughout Westeros. He rarely forgives a slight; Jon Snow once comments that \"Stannis Baratheon with a grievance was like a mastiff with a bone; he gnawed it down to splinters.\" His signature tic is grinding his teeth, often in the face of unpleasant or unforeseen circumstances. He is a renowned commander, sailor, and warrior, although he is a better tactician than fighter. Stannis is known for his brusqueness and lack of tact in social situations and finds himself uncomfortable around women, including his own wife. He abhors brothels and once tried to have them banned from King\\'s Landing, which made him unpopular with the smallfolk there. He dresses plainly in dark clothing and is rarely seen without his sword and dagger. Stannis is plagued with bitterness at the lack of respect and affection he has been shown by his older brother King Robert, and even in childhood was described by the Baratheon family maester as \"the most unloved of the three\"; a \"solemn and joyless\" child \"mature beyond his years\". Stannis is an atheist, despite claims that he is being manipulated by the red priestess Melisandre.\\nAlthough Stannis suffers from a lack of support and resources during the War of Five Kings, he is frequently described by his adversaries, including Tywin Lannister, as the most dangerous rival claimant. Above all he is characterized by his fearless and uncompromising pursuit of justice and duty - he is described by Varys in this way: \"His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man.\"'], 'titles': ['43_Arya_Stark.txt', '43_Arya_Stark.txt', '43_Arya_Stark.txt', '43_Arya_Stark.txt', '343_Catelyn_Stark.txt', '44_Daenerys_Targaryen.txt', '30_List_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_characters.txt', '332_Sansa_Stark.txt', '343_Catelyn_Stark.txt', '349_List_of_Game_of_Thrones_characters.txt', '191_Gendry.txt', '97_Tyrion_Lannister.txt', '332_Sansa_Stark.txt', '40_Stannis_Baratheon.txt', '332_Sansa_Stark.txt', '310_Mother_s_Mercy.txt', '343_Catelyn_Stark.txt', '332_Sansa_Stark.txt', '97_Tyrion_Lannister.txt', '40_Stannis_Baratheon.txt']}}>,\n"," <Answer {'answer': 'Arya is the third child and younger daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark.

R. Martin's ''A Song of Ice and Fire'' epic fantasy novel series.  She is a prominent point of view character in the novels with the third most viewpoint chapters, and is the only viewpoint character to have appeared in every published book of the series.\\nIntroduced in 1996's ''A Game of Thrones'', Arya is the third child and younger daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark.  She is tomboyish, headstrong, feisty, independent, disdains traditional female pursuits, and is often mistaken for a boy.  She wields a smallsword named Needle, a gift from her half-brother, Jon Snow, and is trained in the Braavosi style of sword fighting by Syrio Forel.\\nArya is portrayed by English actress Maisie Williams in HBO's Emmy-winning television adaptation of the novel series, ''Game of Thrones''.  Her performance has garnered critical acclaim, particularly in the second season for her work opposite veteran actor Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) when she served as his cupbearer. She is among the most popular characters in either version of the story.  Williams was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the role in 2016. She and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.\", '\\n=== Recognition and awards ===\\nMaisie Williams has received several award nominations for her portrayal of Arya. For her performance in the series she received two Portal Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Young Actor in 2012, an EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2014, and a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Television Series in 2015.\\nWilliams was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016. Other nominations include the Portal Award for Best Young Actor in 2011, the SFX Awards for Best Actress in 2012 and 2015, the Gold Derby TV Awards for Breakthrough Performer of the Year in 2012, the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series by a Supporting Young Actress in 2013, the EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2015, and the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Young Actor in a Television Series in 2016.', \"\\n=== Television series ===\\nArya Stark is portrayed by English actress Maisie Williams in the television adaption of the book series, this being Williams' first role as an actress. Williams was chosen from among 300 actresses across England.\\nMaisie Williams plays the role of Arya Stark in the television series.\", '\\n=== Description ===\\nArya is left-handed and talented in sums and housekeeping, and is excellent at horse-riding.  In contrast to her more praised sister Sansa, who favors activities traditionally befitting a noblewoman and expresses disdain for outdoor activities, Arya shows no interest in dancing, singing and sewing, and revels in fighting and exploring, much to the chagrin of her mother and household tutor Septa Mordane.  She is described as \"wolf-blooded\", blunt, impulsive and \"always difficult to tame\" by her mother, and was given the nickname \"Arya Underfoot\" by the guards of Winterfell.  She is particularly close to her bastard half-brother Jon Snow, who encourages her to learn how to fight and gives her the smallsword Needle.  The sword is well suited to Arya\\'s slender build and her favored \"Water Dance\" (fencing) style  which emphasizes speed and agility with a thin, light rapier used in quick thrusting attacks.  Throughout her travels, Arya displays great resourcefulness and cunning and also becomes increasingly ruthless.\\nArya is the only one out of her full-siblings to inherit the Stark features and is said to resemble her late aunt Lyanna in both looks and temperament.  At the start of the series, she is generally regarded as messy and plain-looking, and often mistaken for a boy; but there are multiple instances in the books of her (favorable) comparison to the beautiful Lyanna, and catching the eye of men later on in the series.  She is also a skinchanger, capable of telepathically possessing her direwolf Nymeria in dreams, as well as psychically bonding with a street tomcat in Braavos.', '\\n===Television series===\\nIn January 2007 HBO secured the rights to adapt Martin\\'s series for television. Jennifer Ehle was originally cast as Catelyn Stark and filmed her scenes in the unaired pilot until she eventually left for family reasons. Michelle Fairley was then cast in the role, which she played for three seasons. Catelyn\\'s storyline diverges from the book following the Red Wedding in that she never reappears as Lady Stoneheart.\\nFairley\\'s performance has received critical acclaim. \\'\\'Time\\'\\' wrote about \"The Rains of Castamere\": \"Michelle Fairley’s fantastic performance captures the horror, with the edge of desperation, anguish, and madness of a woman who has lost her sons (she believes all of them), lost her grandchild, may have lost her daughters, and for all she knows, is witnessing the extinction of the house she belongs to...\". The closing scene of \"Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things\" was praised by HitFix\\'s Alan Sepinwall, highlighting Michelle Fairley\\'s acting as Catelyn gathers allies to arrest Tyrion.', '\\n===Casting and development===\\nA blue, scale-covered dress worn by Daenerys in the TV series \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\\nMartin said that the character was aged in the television series because of child pornography regulations. Tamzin Merchant played Daenerys in the original pilot, but the first episode was re-shot with Emilia Clarke in the role. Weiss and Benioff said, \"Emilia was the only person we saw—and we saw hundreds—who could carry the full range that Daenerys required\". Clarke, in reflection of the character\\'s evolution in the television series, stated: \"Throughout the season she\\'s had an insane transformation from someone who barely even spoke and timidly did everything her brother said into a mother of dragons and a queen of armies and a killer of slave masters. She\\'s a very Joan of Arc-style character.\" Clarke said she accepts acting nude if \"a nude scene forwards a story or is shot in a way that adds insight into characters\". She added that \"sometimes explicit scenes are required and make sense for the characters/story, as they do in Westeros\" and that she can discuss with a director how to make a gratuitously nude scene more subtle. Clarke, however, has used a body double in past background non-nude appearances, particularly Rosie Mac in season 5.\\nIn October 2014, Clarke and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' called the raises \"huge\", noting that the deal would make the performers \"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\". \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' put the number for season five at \"close to $300,000 an episode\" for each actor, and \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \"upward of $500,000 per episode\" for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Clarke became one of the highest paid actors on television and earned £2\\xa0million per episode for the show.', \"\\n=== Arya Stark ===\\nArya Stark is the third child and younger daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. She serves as a POV character for 33 chapters throughout ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', ''A Storm of Swords'', ''A Feast for Crows'', and ''A Dance with Dragons''. So far she is the only character to appear in all 5 books as a POV character.\\nIn the HBO television adaptation, she is portrayed by Maisie Williams.\", '\\n===Reception===\\nSophie Turner plays the role of Sansa Stark in the television series\\nAs her storyline has progressed, Sansa has received critical acclaim for the development of her character and her emergence from a naive young girl to a strong young woman. \\'\\'Rolling Stone\\'\\' ranked Sansa as No. 4 on a list of the \"Top 40 \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' Characters\", saying that Sansa is \"often overlooked in favor of her killer kid sister\", but that her \"quiet, innate political shrewedness and emotional strength have enabled her to survive\", and calling her \"the show\\'s best-kept secret\". In a ranking of the 48 best \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' characters listed in the main credits in the first five seasons on the website \\'\\'The Wrap\\'\\', Sansa was ranked at No. 4, ahead of the more popular Daenerys Targaryen, Jon Snow, and Tyrion Lannister, saying that \"Sansa has been kind of great in Season 6, turning into the sort of badass we always hoped but never thought she actually could become\".\\nIn an article published on \\'\\'Mic.\\'\\'com, Julianne Ross says that \"the elder Stark daughter is often cited as one of the most reviled characters on \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'\", while also saying that \"not coincidentally, Sansa Stark is also one of the most classically feminine characters on the show.\" Ross criticized the heavy hatred for Sansa, particularly in contrast to \"her universally (and rightly) adored tomboy little sister Arya\", stating that Sansa \"arguably gets a disproportionate amount of fan hate because she doesn\\'t fit the narrow \\'strong female character\\' mold we\\'re used to rooting for.\"  Blogger Rhiannon Thomas of \\'\\'Feminist Fiction\\'\\' wrote in 2012 that \"the focus on this sort of female character - the oft-cited \\'strong female character\\' - seems to suggest that femininity is still \\'\\'bad,\\'\\' and that women can only be strong by adopting stereotypically male roles and attitudes\". Thomas went on to say that \"in an abusive situation that would break so many people, Sansa survives\" and that she has a \"woman\\'s courage\" that \"keeps her alive and in the game where characters like Arya would not last five minutes\".\\nIn an article published on MTV.com by Crystal Bell titled \"Sansa Stark is the Only \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' Hero Worth Rooting For\", Bell writes: \"Sansa is the most relatable character in George R.R. Martin\\'s canon. She\\'s often despised for having no agency, but the way I see it, Sansa is hated for being a woman. Unlike Brienne, Arya, Cersei, and Margaery -- models of the \"strong female character\" archetype—Sansa\\'s passivity denotes weakness. She doesn\\'t have cool swordplay skills like her sister Arya; she isn\\'t a smart seductress like Margaery Tyrell or a fierce queen like Cersei. She is the epitome of femininity on \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\', and therefore, she is dismissed.\" Bell went on to say: \"However, Sansa\\'s greatest strength as a character has been her unwavering resilience. She was tortured and humiliated for seasons by the unhinged man-boys around her. She\\'s been the subject of everyday sexism and misogyny since day one. And yet, she survives, even as armor-clad heroes fall before her. She is the show\\'s survivor. She continuously \\'\\'endures\\'\\' the pain and humiliation of being a woman in Westeros. Just because Sansa doesn\\'t wield a sword as fiercely as Arya and Brienne, or command a horde of dragons like Daenerys Targaryen, doesn\\'t make her any less of a hero.\"\\nSansa received particular acclaim in Season 6 of the show, during which she began her quest to retake her family home and exact revenge on those who wronged her. In an interview with \\'\\'The New York Times\\'\\', actress Sophie Turner said that \"she\\'s Sansa no longer a pawn in anyone\\'s game; she\\'s no longer a prisoner...she\\'s the one taking charge and doing her own thing, which is very exciting\". Megan Garber of \\'\\'The Atlantic\\'\\' praised the show\\'s decision to have Sansa be the one orchestrating Ramsay\\'s death in Battle of the Bastards, saying that \"In the end, it was Sansa and her abuser, alone again in a darkened chamber; in the end though, it was Sansa making the decisions about who would be the victim.\"  On the scene, Turner said: \"It\\'s amazing. It\\'s Sansa\\'s first kill and it\\'s such a strong moment for her because all her life she\\'s been affected by these men who have just done such terrible things to her....\"\\nFollowing the penultimate Season 6 episode, Bennett Madison of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' wrote \"When Sansa icily reminds her dopey brother that \\'No one can protect you\\', it\\'s because she\\'s always been on her own. As far back as King\\'s Landing, Sansa\\'s between quietly protecting herself, working on her stitchery while taking cool measure of everything going on around her, learning how to game the system, and slithering through situations that would have gotten the best of the show\\'s more flashy or impulsive characters. In \\'Battle of the Bastards\\', she got to show a little flash of her own; by being defiantly, gloriously correct in her convictions, by saving the day with her foresight and savvy, and by feeding Ramsay to the dogs.\"  Turner later told \\'\\'Time\\'\\' magazine about how gratifying it was to watch Sansa\\'s development during Season 6 and defended the show on its cruel treatment of women: \"In my opinion, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' is not sexist, and it\\'s accurate to medieval time. The show puts social boundaries on the women, and they break out of these boundaries.\"', '\\n==Character description==\\nCatelyn Stark is described as beautiful, with fair skin, long auburn hair, blue eyes, long fingers, high cheekbones and full breasts, and dressed simply in the grey color of House Stark or the blue and red of her father’s House Tully.  She is proud, strong, kind and generous, has a strong grasp of politics, and is often governed by the desire to protect her children.  Catelyn is usually in accord with her husband Eddard Stark, but resents his admission of his illegitimate son Jon Snow into their household.', \"\\n===Brienne of Tarth===\\n'''Brienne of Tarth''' (seasons 2–8) portrayed by Gwendoline Christie. A former member of Renly Baratheon's Kingsguard. She is a highly trained and skilled warrior made dangerous by the fact that men underestimate her. She is considered ugly because she is abnormally large in height and build, androgynous, and stronger than most men. She wishes to prove her valor in a worthy cause to win respect and acceptance. She becomes infatuated with Renly after he shows her kindness and courtesy, and she wins a place in his Kingsguard after winning a tournament melee against Ser Loras. Renly trusts Brienne because of her loyalty and her willingness to die for him. She is present at Renly's death and is falsely accused of his murder.\", \"\\n==Storylines ==\\nCoat of arms of House Baratheon\\nGendry is not a point of view character in the novels, and his actions are witnessed and interpreted primarily through the eyes of Arya Stark, as well as some descriptions from Eddard Stark and Brienne of Tarth.  He has the most story arc out of King Robert's children.\", '\\n===Recognition and awards===\\nPeter Dinklage is the series\\'s most successful cast member in terms of awards, having won 7 awards and received 37 additional nominations\\nDinklage\\'s performance was praised; \\'\\'The Boston Globe\\'\\' called his Tyrion one of the show\\'s \"highlights\", adding that Dinklage \"gives a winning performance that is charming, morally ambiguous, and self-aware.\" Matt Roush of \\'\\'TV Guide\\'\\' told viewers to \"rejoice in the scene-stealing bravado of Peter Dinklage as the wry \\'imp\\' Tyrion Lannister.\" The \\'\\'Los Angeles Times\\'\\' wrote \"In many ways, \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' belongs to Dinklage\" even before, in Season 2, the \"scene-stealing actor\\'s\" character became the series\\' most central figure. \\'\\'The New York Times\\'\\' noted that as beloved as the character of Tyrion is to the novels\\' fans, \"Dinklage\\'s sly performance has made Tyrion all the more popular.\" \\'\\'The Huffington Post\\'\\' called Tyrion the \"most quotable\" character on the HBO series, as well as one of the most beloved.\\nIn April 2011 both the \\'\\'Los Angeles Times\\'\\' and \\'\\'Entertainment Weekly\\'\\' pronounced Dinklage worthy of an Emmy Award for his performance in Season 1. He subsequently received one for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series, as well as a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries, or Television Film. He also earned a Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film and a Scream Award for Best Supporting Actor for Season 1 of \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'. Dinklage won the Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor again in 2015, and 2018.\\nDinklage has been nominated for the Emmy four other times for playing Tyrion, in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2016. He has received several other award nominations for his performance in the series, including the Critics\\' Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series in 2012 and 2016; the Satellite Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Series, Miniseries or Television Film in 2012, 2015, and 2016; the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series in 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017; the TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Drama in 2011 and 2012; and in 2011 both the IGN Award and the IGN People\\'s Choice Award for Best TV Actor.', '\\n===Recognition and awards===\\nSophie Turner has received several award nominations for her portrayal of Sansa including an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2019. For her performance in the series she earned the Glamour Award for Best UK TV Actress in 2016 and 2017, and an EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2016. Other nominations include the Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series by a Supporting Young Actress in 2012, and the EWwy Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Drama Series in 2015.', \"\\n==== Season 2 ====\\nStannis' personal banner in the TV series.\\nStannis falls under the influence of Melisandre, a priestess of R'hllor who believes Stannis is the reincarnation of a legendary hero from her religion. After Robert's death, Stannis claims himself the true heir to the Iron Throne as Cersei's children are bastards born of incest. However, most of the Baratheon bannermen support the claim of the younger but far more charismatic Renly. Stannis confronts Renly and offers to make him his heir if he supports him, but Renly refuses, only using the negotiations as an opportunity to mock his brother, and intending to kill Stannis in battle the next day. Melisandre, who had seduced Stannis, gives birth to a shadow baby bearing Stannis' face that kills Renly, and many of Renly's bannermen immediately swear allegiance to Stannis. He then attacks King's Landing by sailing up Blackwater Bay. Stannis' force breaches the walls, but due to Tyrion Lannister's use of wildfire and the arrival of last-minute Lannister and Tyrell reinforcements, he is defeated. Nonetheless, he is convinced to continue fighting by Melisandre, and is further convinced by her magic as she shows him a vision of a battle in the flames.\", '\\n====Controversy====\\nIn the episode \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\", Sansa\\'s rape was the main subject of controversy for the season\\'s deviations from the books. The majority of professional criticism concerned the decision to have Ramsay rape Sansa on their wedding night, with most critics describing the scene as gratuitous and artistically unnecessary. \"This grim scene was difficult for the show to justify,\" said Charlotte Runcie of \\'\\'The Daily Telegraph\\'\\'. Joanna Robinson of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' added, \"this rape scene undercuts all the agency that’s been growing in Sansa since the end of last season. ... I’d never advocate that \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' (or any work of fiction) shy away from edgy plots out of fear of pushback or controversy. But edgy plots should always accomplish something above pure titillation or shock value and what, \\'\\'exactly\\'\\', was accomplished here?\" Christopher Orr wrote in \\'\\'The Atlantic\\'\\', \"I continue to be astonished that showrunners Benioff and Weiss still apparently believe that their tendency to ramp up the sex, violence, and—especially—sexual violence of George R.R. Martin’s source material is a strength rather than the defining weakness of their adaptation.\" Myles McNutt of \\'\\'The A.V. Club\\'\\' wrote, \"The issue with the show returning to rape as a trope is not simply because there have been thinkpieces speaking out against it, and is not solely driven by the rational concerns lying at the heart of those thinkpieces. It’s also that the show has lost my faith as a viewer.\" Writers from \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\', \\'\\'The Mary Sue\\'\\' and \\'\\'The Daily Beast\\'\\' all disapproved of the decision to use Sansa\\'s victimization as a motivating agent for Theon, saying that the scene undermined Sansa\\'s character development: \"Was it really important to make that scene about Theon\\'s pain?\" wrote Joanna Robinson of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\'.\\nOther critics responded positively to the scene. Sean T. Collins of \\'\\'Rolling Stone\\'\\' wrote: \"By involving a multidimensional main character instead of one introduced primarily to suffer, the series has a chance to grant this story the gravity and seriousness it deserves. Sarah Hughes of \\'\\'The Guardian\\'\\' wrote: \"I have repeatedly made clear that I’m not a fan of rape as a plot device – but the story of Ramsay and Sansa’s wedding was more than that. ... The writers are walking a very fine line here. They handled it well tonight, telling a gothic tale of innocence sacrificed\". Alyssa Rosenberg of \\'\\'The Washington Post\\'\\' wrote that the scene \"managed to maintain a fine balance, employing a dignity and care for the experiences of victims that \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\' has not always demonstrated.\"\\nSome critics questioned why this scene in particular should generate outrage when similar scenes have not. Sara Stewart of the \\'\\'New York Post\\'\\' pointed out that the rape and sexual abuse of both female and male characters is typical for \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\': \"Why are we suddenly so outraged about the rape of Sansa Stark, when this show has served up a steady diet of sexual assault and violence against women since its first season began?\" Cathy Young of \\'\\'Reason\\'\\' magazine, writing in \\'\\'Time\\'\\' noted what she calls a lack of complaint in response to the sexual mistreatment of male characters in earlier seasons, specifically the literal emasculation of Theon Greyjoy and the sexual assault of Gendry.\\nCriticism of the scene has not extended to the quality of the acting. Joanna Robinson of \\'\\'Vanity Fair\\'\\' wrote, \"And if we can say one positive thing about that scene it\\'s that Allen nailed his performance. Theon\\'s horror mirrored our own and the camera—focusing on his reaction—let our minds fill in the blanks.\" Sophie Turner defended the scene as an artistic challenge for herself as an actor, saying, \"When I read that scene, I kinda loved it. I love the way Ramsay had Theon watching. It was all so messed up. It\\'s also so daunting for me to do it. ... I think it\\'s going to be the most challenging season for me so far, just because it\\'s so emotional for her. It\\'s not just crying all the time, like seasons 2 or 3, it\\'s super messed up.\" Iwan Rheon (Ramsay Bolton) agreed, referring to Turner\\'s performances this season as \"absolutely amazing.\"\\nSome viewers, including U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, announced that they would stop watching the show because of this scene. According to \\'\\'Business Insider\\'\\', this scene and increased use of streaming services are likely reasons why ratings dropped from 6.2 million viewers for this episode to 5.4 million for the next episode, \"The Gift.\"', '\\n===Cersei\\'s walk of atonement===\\nActress Lena Headey portrays Cersei Lannister in the series.\\nFor Cersei Lannister\\'s nude \"walk of atonement\" through King\\'s Landing, HBO employed actress Rebecca Van Cleave as a body double for Lena Headey. While filming the scene in Dubrovnik, Croatia in October 2014, Van Cleave performed fully nude while Headey wore a simple beige shift. Both performances were then merged by the show\\'s editing team, combining close-ups of Headey\\'s facial expressions and long shots of Van Cleave\\'s nude walk through the city. In some instances CGI was used to put Headey\\'s face on Van Cleave\\'s body.\\nHeadey says that the showrunners decided to cast a body double for \"several reasons.\" Headey says she was glad to use a body double for the scene because she wanted to focus on the character\\'s emotions. Another actor noted that Headey\\'s \"extensive tattoos\" may have been another reason. Months later, Headey announced that she was pregnant with her second child, though it is unclear if she was pregnant when this scene had to be filmed. Sarah Buchanan of \\'\\'Express\\'\\' notes the strangeness of casting a much younger actress to play the middle-aged Cersei when the key outcome of the walk of atonement in \\'\\'A Dance with Dragons\\'\\' is that when the people see that Cersei\\'s body is not beautiful, she loses a large part of her mystique. The 27-year-old Van Cleave did not show any of the specific signs of aging or past pregnancy for which the Cersei of the books was mocked by the crowd.\\nWhen casting for the role, HBO received applications from more than  actresses to act as Headey\\'s body double for the scene. A selection of seven finalists, including Van Cleave, was then flown to Belfast, Northern Ireland to audition before the show\\'s producers. Headey also opted out of the casting process, but director David Nutter said finding the right double was one of the most important parts of making the finale. \"We needed somebody who could do The Walk of Shame physically, somebody who could match Lena\\'s integrity, intensity, and sensibility. We found a tremendous actress in Rebecca; she was a godsend. The courage of this girl, who\\'s never done anything like this in her life, who understood what was important about this...once I had her I felt like I could accomplish anything.\"\\nVan Cleave herself described the scene as \"one of the scariest, most wonderful, most gratifying experiences I could have imagined ... I never in a million years would have thought I would be in Dubrovnik surrounded by hundreds of extras and crew members throwing food at me, but it was amazing\" and \"I hope the next thing I do will have my head in it.\" She also praised Headey\\'s willingness to help her, describing the two of them as a \"tag-team\"; Headey would walk behind Van Cleave during the shoot, coaching her on the character\\'s responses.\\nWhen the showrunners first announced the plans of shooting a nude scene in Dubrovnik, the city\\'s Catholic Church of St. Nicholas strongly opposed the idea, due to it being immoral to walk their sacred grounds in the nude. Eventually, both parties came to the agreement that the shooting could commence, provided no nude scenes would be filmed in a place of worship. During the three-day shoot, Headey walked Van Cleave through each shot, giving insight into all the emotions Cersei was feeling. The six-minute scene was filmed using 500 extras.', '\\'\\'\\'Catelyn Stark\\'\\'\\' (née \\'\\'\\'Tully\\'\\'\\') is a fictional character in the \\'\\'A Song of Ice and Fire\\'\\' series of fantasy novels by American author George R.

She is a prominent point of view character in the first three novels.\\nIntroduced in 1996\\'s \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\', Catelyn is the wife of Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell, the Warden of the North, and is mother to five of his children, but resents his bastard son Jon Snow.  She was born into House Tully of Riverrun, the lord paramount clan of the Riverlands, another one of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, and has two younger siblings, sister Lysa and brother Edmure.  Catelyn was originally betrothed to Eddard\\'s older brother Brandon Stark, the heir to Winterfell at the time, and married Eddard instead after the former\\'s death leading up to Robert Baratheon\\'s rebellion against House Targaryen.\\nCatelyn is portrayed by Northern Irish actress Michelle Fairley on the HBO series \\'\\'Game of Thrones\\'\\'.  American actress Jennifer Ehle was originally cast as Catelyn Stark and appeared in the unaired pilot, but left the series for family reasons before the first season began. Fairley\\'s portrayal of Catelyn has garnered critical acclaim, with many in particular praising her performance during the episode \"The Rains of Castamere\". Due to this popularity, many fans were disappointed she did not appear in the series\\' fourth season, despite the character\\'s resurrection in the novels.', '\\n==Character and appearances==\\nSansa Stark is the second child and elder daughter of Eddard Stark and Catelyn Stark. She was born and raised in Winterfell, until leaving with her father and sister at the beginning of the series. She was raised with a younger sister Arya Stark, two younger brothers Rickon Stark and Bran Stark, as well as an older brother Robb Stark, and an older illegitimate half-brother, Jon Snow.\\nRaised as a lady, Sansa is traditionally feminine. Sansa\\'s interests are music, poetry, and singing. She strives to become like the heroines of romantic tales by attempting to find a prince, knight, or gentleman to fall in love with. For a companion animal, she owned a direwolf named Lady. However, Lady was killed in place of Arya\\'s direwolf, Nymeria, after Nymeria attacked the Crown Prince, Joffrey Baratheon, and later fled.\\nSansa has been described as tall, slim, womanly, and beautiful, destined to be a lady or a queen. She has blue eyes and thick auburn hair that she inherits from her mother, who came from House Tully in the Riverlands region prior to her marriage to Eddard Stark. She has her hair dyed dark brown later on while in the Vale, disguised as Alayne Stone, the bastard daughter of Petyr Baelish.  Sansa is 11 years old in \\'\\'A Game of Thrones\\'\\' and nearly 14 in \\'\\'A Feast for Crows\\'\\'. Arguably the most naive of the Stark children at the start of the series, Sansa often finds herself used as a pawn in the machinations of the other characters. However, as the story progresses, she matures and becomes more of a player of the game rather than a pawn for other characters. She is the most beautiful woman in Westeros at the time of the events of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".', '\\n==TV adaptation==\\nExecutive producers/writers David Benioff and D. B. Weiss had pitched the idea of adapting Martin\\'s series for television to HBO in March 2006, and the network secured the rights in January 2007. The first actor cast was Peter Dinklage as Tyrion in May 2009. Benioff and Weiss later noted that the funny and \"incredibly smart\" Dinklage was their first choice for the role, as the actor\\'s \"core of humanity, covered by a shell of sardonic dry wit, is pretty well in keeping with the character.\" Unfamiliar with the source material, Dinklage was cautious in his first meeting with the producers; as a dwarf, \"he wouldn\\'t play elves or leprechauns\" and – choosy about genre roles – he had just come from portraying the dwarf Trumpkin in 2008\\'s \\'\\'The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian\\'\\'. Benioff and Weiss told Dinklage that the character was \"a different kind of fantasy little person,\" or in the actor\\'s words, \"No beard, no pointy shoes, a romantic, real human being.\" Dinklage signed on to play Tyrion before the meeting was half over, in part because \"They told me how popular he was.\" Martin said of Dinklage\\'s casting, \"If he hadn\\'t accepted the part, oh, boy, I don\\'t know what we would have done.\" Benioff added, \"When I read George\\'s books, I decided Tyrion Lannister was one of the great characters in literature. Not just fantasy literature – literature! A brilliant, caustic, horny, drunken, self-flagellating mess of a man. And there was only one choice to play him.\"\\nIn October 2014, Dinklage and several other key cast members, all contracted for six seasons of the series, renegotiated their deals to include a potential seventh season and salary increases for seasons five, six, and seven. \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' called the raises \"huge\", noting that the deal would make the performers \"among the highest-paid actors on cable TV\". \\'\\'Deadline Hollywood\\'\\' put the number for season five at \"close to $300,000 an episode\" for each actor, and \\'\\'The Hollywood Reporter\\'\\' wrote in June 2016 that the performers would each be paid \"upward of $500,000 per episode\" for seasons seven and the potential eight. In 2017, Dinklage became one of the highest paid actors on television and will earn £2\\xa0million per episode for the show.', '\\n===Appearance and personality===\\nStannis is frequently described as a large and sinewy man that towers over others, such as Davos Seaworth and Jon Snow, a Baratheon trait. He lacks the long black hair of his brothers, and is instead balding, although he keeps a close-cropped beard of the signature Baratheon black. His face is described as \\'tight like cured leather\\' with hollow, gaunt cheeks. His eyes are described by Asha Greyjoy as \\'deep, sunken pits\\', with a powerful stare that suggests an \\'iron ferocity\\'.\\nStannis\\' most prominent characteristics are his flinty and austere demeanor, unrelenting stubbornness, and powerful sense of duty and justice, the latter of which he is notorious for throughout Westeros. He rarely forgives a slight; Jon Snow once comments that \"Stannis Baratheon with a grievance was like a mastiff with a bone; he gnawed it down to splinters.\" His signature tic is grinding his teeth, often in the face of unpleasant or unforeseen circumstances. He is a renowned commander, sailor, and warrior, although he is a better tactician than fighter. Stannis is known for his brusqueness and lack of tact in social situations and finds himself uncomfortable around women, including his own wife. He abhors brothels and once tried to have them banned from King\\'s Landing, which made him unpopular with the smallfolk there. He dresses plainly in dark clothing and is rarely seen without his sword and dagger. Stannis is plagued with bitterness at the lack of respect and affection he has been shown by his older brother King Robert, and even in childhood was described by the Baratheon family maester as \"the most unloved of the three\"; a \"solemn and joyless\" child \"mature beyond his years\". Stannis is an atheist, despite claims that he is being manipulated by the red priestess Melisandre.\\nAlthough Stannis suffers from a lack of support and resources during the War of Five Kings, he is frequently described by his adversaries, including Tywin Lannister, as the most dangerous rival claimant. Above all he is characterized by his fearless and uncompromising pursuit of justice and duty - he is described by Varys in this way: \"His claim is the true one, he is known for his prowess as a battle commander, and he is utterly without mercy. There is no creature on earth half so terrifying as a truly just man.\"'], 'titles': ['43_Arya_Stark.txt', '43_Arya_Stark.txt', '43_Arya_Stark.txt', '43_Arya_Stark.txt', '343_Catelyn_Stark.txt', '44_Daenerys_Targaryen.txt', '30_List_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_characters.txt', '332_Sansa_Stark.txt', '343_Catelyn_Stark.txt', '349_List_of_Game_of_Thrones_characters.txt', '191_Gendry.txt', '97_Tyrion_Lannister.txt', '332_Sansa_Stark.txt', '40_Stannis_Baratheon.txt', '332_Sansa_Stark.txt', '310_Mother_s_Mercy.txt', '343_Catelyn_Stark.txt', '332_Sansa_Stark.txt', '97_Tyrion_Lannister.txt', '40_Stannis_Baratheon.txt']}}>]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":20}],"source":["pipe.run(\n","    query=\"How did Arya Stark's character get portrayed in a television adaptation?\",\n","    params={\"Retriever\": {\"top_k\": 20},\n","            \"Generator\": {\"top_k\": 2}}\n",")['answers']"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pipe.run(query=\"Why is Arya Stark an unusual character?\", params={\"Retriever\": {\"top_k\": 3}})"],"metadata":{"id":"IfTP9BfFGOo6","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1647339570403,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2344,"user":{"displayName":"Ahmed N.
